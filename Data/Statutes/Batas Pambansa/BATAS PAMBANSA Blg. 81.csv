""If the government of a foreign country permits the revenue stamps of such country to be affixed in the Philippines to tobacco (including cigars) or shall manufactured in the Philippines and imported into such foreign country, internal revenue stamps of the Philippines may be affixed to tobacco (including cigars) or snuff manufactured in such foreign country to be imported into the Philippines from such foreign country, under such rules and regulations as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Minister of Finance may prescribe.

No cigarettes shall be allowed to be removed from any factory unless this requirement has been complied with.
""Any manufacturer or importer who, in violation of this Section, knowingly misdeclares or misrepresents in his sworn statement herein required any pertinent data or information, including the approved maximum retail price of his locally manufactured or imported cigarettes, shall upon discovery be penalized by a summary cancellation or withdrawal of his permit to engage in business as manufacturer or importer of cigarettes.
