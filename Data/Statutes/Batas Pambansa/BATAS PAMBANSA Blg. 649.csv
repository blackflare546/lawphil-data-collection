Claims for exemption under this provision shall be allowed upon certification by the Ministry of Agrarian Reform that the compensation waived has been determined to be in accordance with the provisions of Presidential Decree Numbered Twenty-seven, as amended, and its implementing guidelines, which certification shall be issued within the period provided for in Section one hereof.
