Section 2. Detailed Plans and programs of Work - Prior to the actual construction, improvement, rehabilitation and/or reconstruction of the projects covered in whole or in part by appropriations in this Act, approval of detailed engineering plans and programs of work by the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communications or the Minister of Public Highways, as the case may be, shall be obtained for every project with an estimated cost greater than ₱1,000,000; by the Bureau Head concerned for every project with an estimated cost greater than ₱500,000 but not more than ₱1,000,000; by the Regional Director concerned for every project with an estimated cost greater than ₱200,000 but not more than ₱500,000; and by the District or City Engineer concerned for every project with an estimated cost of ₱200,000 or less. The program of work shall include, among other things, estimates of the work items quantities and costs, a PERT/CPM (Program Evaluation Review Technique/Critical Path Method) network of the project activities, and monthly cash flows. The program of work shall cover at least a usable portion of the project and no construction shall be started for portions of the project that are less than usable, except projects requiring stage construction, provided that continuity of construction up to the completion of a usable portion is assured. Once the program of work is approved, it shall be serve as the basis for the implementation of the project and the corresponding expenditure of funds. No project shall be divided into smaller portions for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Section.
Section 3. Local Labor - In the implementation of projects covered by appropriations in this Act, the required unskilled labor shall be procured, where available, from the sitio, barangay, poblacion, municipality or city where the project is located, and, for this purpose, a certification from the City or Municipal Mayor or Barangay Captain, as the case may be, shall be secured as to the availability of the unskilled labor. Skilled labor shall be procured, where available, from within the province where the project is located. Specialized skilled labor may be procured outside the province where the project is located.
Section 4. Labor-Intensive Methods - Whenever technically and economically feasible, labor-intensive methods shall be used in the prosecution of the projects authorized in this Act: Provided, That (a) the estimated financial cost of each project done by labor-intensive methods does not exceed the cost of the best alternative construction method defined by the agency concerned by more than ten per centum (10%), (b) the estimated duration of the project done by labor-intensive methods does not exceed the duration of the best alternative method defined by the agency concerned by more than fifty per centum (50%), and (c) the employment of workers in the projects will not unduly impair the labor requirements of agricultural production: Provided, finally, That before any such project is prosecuted, the agency concerned shall prepared at least two alternative methods of construction based on the same plans and structural standards, one being labor-intensive together with a comparative evaluation of projected financial and economic costs, employment generation, and technical quality; such comparison shall be the basis for selecting the most advantageous construction techniques to be employed in terms of the criteria aforestated. The District or City Engineer concerned shall certify in the program of work that he has maximized the use of labor-intensive methods in accordance with the foregoing criteria. The purchase of hand tools and other work implements for undertaking projects by labor-intensive methods may be charged against project funds not exceeding five per centum (5%) of the estimated project cost. These implements may be turned over to the laborers with the payment therefor deductible from their wages on reasonable installments during the duration of their employment in the project.
The agencies concerned shall refer to and take into consideration the relevant studies of the Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Communications and the Ministry of Public Highways for the identification of project work items or activities suitable for labor-intensive methods of construction.
Section 5. Pre-Construction Activities - In the implementation of the work, a general plan of operations shall be prepared to indicate the methods and the procedures to be followed. This plan will cover and organize all relevant fields of study, delineation of responsibilities for undertaking each phase, specifying or analyzing all analytical procedures and resources to be required for conducting the studies.
Section 6. Purchase of Materials and Supplies - The Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communications or the Minister of Public Highways, as the case may be, is authorized, subject to bidding and auditing requirements, to procure the necessary materials and supplies for the construction, reconstruction, improvement, repair and/or rehabilitation of any project covered by appropriations in this Act. When these materials and supplies are obtainable locally in the province or city where the project is located, the same may be procured by the District of City Engineer or, in the case of special projects, the Project Manager, without prior authority, from the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communications or the Minister of Public Highways, as the case may be, subject to bidding and auditing requirements. No surcharge shall be imposed for the service of procuring such materials and supplies.
