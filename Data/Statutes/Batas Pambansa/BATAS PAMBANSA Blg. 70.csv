""Consequently, unfair labor practices are not only violations of the civil rights of both labor and management but are also criminal offenses against the State which shall be subject to prosecution and punishment as herein provided.
""Subject to the exercise by the President (Prime Minister) or by the Minister of Labor of the powers vested in them by Articles 264 and 265 of this Code, the civil aspects of all cases involving unfair labor practices, which may include claims for damages and other affirmative relief, shall be under the jurisdiction of the labor arbiters. They shall resolve such cases within thirty (30) working days from the time they are submitted for decision.
""Recovery of civil liability in the administrative proceedings shall bar recovery under the Civil Code.
""No criminal prosecution under this Title may be instituted without a final judgment, finding that an unfair labor practice was committed, having been first obtained in the administrative proceeding referred to in the preceding paragraph.
