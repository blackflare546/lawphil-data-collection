Section 11. Section 30, Article VI of the same Act is hereby further amended to read as follows:

""Sec. 30. Voluntary Submission of a Drug Dependent to Confinement, Treatment and Rehabilitation by the Dependent Himself or Through His Parent, Guardian or Relative. If a drug dependent voluntarily submits himself for confinement, treatment and rehabilitation in a center and complies with such conditions therefor as the Board may by rules and regulations prescribe, he shall not be criminally liable for any violation of Section 8, Article II and Section 16, Article III of this Act.
""The above exemption shall be extended to a minor who may be committed for treatment and rehabilitation in a center upon sworn petition of his parent, guardian or relative within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity, or of the Minister of Health or the Minister of Social Services and Development, in that order. Such petition may be filed with the regional trial court of the province or city where the minor resides and shall set forth therein his name and address and the facts relating to his dependency. The court shall set the petition for hearing and give the drug dependent concerned an opportunity to be heard. If, after such hearing, the facts so warrant in its judgment, the court shall order the drug dependent to be examined by two physicians accredited by the Board. If both physicians conclude, after examination, that the minor is not a drug dependent, the court shall enter an order discharging him. If either physician finds him to be a dependent, the court shall conduct a hearing and consider all relevant evidence which may be offered. If the court makes a finding of drug dependency, it shall issue an order for his commitment to a center designated by the court for treatment and rehabilitation under the supervision of the Board.
""Upon certification of the center that he may be temporarily discharged from the center, the court shall order his release therefrom on condition that he shall report to the Board for after-care and follow-up treatment for a period not exceeding eighteen months under such terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Board. If at any time during the after-care and follow-up period the Board certifies to his complete rehabilitation, the court shall enter an order of final discharge. Should the Board find at any time during the after-care and follow-up period that he requires further treatment and rehabilitation in the center, it shall make a report to this effect to the court which shall thereupon order his recommitment to the center.
""Should the drug dependent having voluntarily submitted himself for confinement, treatment and rehabilitation in, or having been committed to a center upon petition of the proper party, escape therefrom, he may resubmit himself for confinement within one week from the date of his escape, or his parent, guardian or relative may, within the same period, surrender him for recommitment. If, however, the drug dependent does not resubmit himself for confinement or he is not surrendered for recommitment, as the case may be, the Board may apply with the court for the issuance of a recommitment order. Upon proof of previous commitment or of his voluntary submission to confinement, treatment and rehabilitation, the court shall issue an order for recommitment. If, subsequent to such recommitment, he should escape again, he shall no longer be exempt from criminal liability for use or possession of any dangerous drugs.
""The judicial and medical records pertaining to any drug dependents confinement or commitment under this Section shall be confidential and shall not be used against him for any purpose except to determine how many times he shall have voluntarily submitted himself to confinement, treatment and rehabilitation or been committed to a center.""

Section 12. Section 32, Article VI of the same Act is hereby further amended to read as follows:

""Sec. 31. Compulsory Submission of a Drug Dependent to Treatment and Rehabilitation. If a person charged with an offense is found by the fiscal or by the court, at any stage of the proceedings, to be a drug dependent, the fiscal or the court, as the case may be, shall suspend all further proceedings and transmit copies of the record of the case to the Board.
""In the event the Board determines, after medical examination, that public interest requires that such drug dependent be committed to a center for treatment and rehabilitation, it shall file a petition for his commitment with the regional trial court of the province or city were he is being investigated or tried: Provided, That where a criminal case is pending in court, such petition shall be filed in the said court. The court shall take judicial notice of the prior proceedings in the case and shall proceed to hear the petition. If the court finds him to be a drug dependent, it shall order his commitment to a center for treatment and rehabilitation. The head of said center shall submit to the court every four months, or as often as the court may require, a written report on the progress of the treatment. If the dependent is rehabilitated, as certified by the center and the Board, he shall be returned to the court which committed him, for his discharge therefrom.
""Thereafter, his prosecution for any offense punishable by law shall be instituted or shall continue, as the case may be. In case of conviction, the judgment shall, if the accused is certified by the treatment and rehabilitation center to have maintained good behavior, indicate that he shall be given full credit for the period he was confined in the center: Provided, however, That when the offense is for violation of Section 8 or Section 16 of this Act and the accused is not a recidivist, the penalty thereof shall be deemed to have been served in the center upon his release therefrom after certification by the center and the Board that he is rehabilitated.
""The period of prescription of the offense charged shall not run during the time that the respondent or the accused is under detention or confinement in a center.""

Section 13. Section 32, Article VI of the same Act is hereby amended to read as follows:

""Sec. 32. Suspension of Sentence for First Offense of a Minor. If an accused under eighteen years of age at the time of the commission of the offense but not more than twenty-one years at the time when judgment should have been promulgated, who is found guilty of violating Section 8, Article II and Section 16, Article III of this Act has not been previously convicted of violating any provision of this Act or of the Revised Penal Code or placed on probation as herein provided, the court may defer sentence and place him on probation under the supervision of the Board or its agents and under such conditions as the court may impose for a period ranging from six months to one year. If the accused violates any of the conditions of his probation, the court shall pronounce judgment of conviction and he shall serve sentence as in any other criminal case. If, however, he does not violate any condition of his probation, then upon the expiration of the designated period, the court shall discharge him and dismiss the proceedings.
""If the court finds that such accused is a drug dependent, it shall commit him to a center for treatment and rehabilitation under the supervision of the Board. Upon certification by the center that he may be temporarily discharged from the center, the court shall order his release therefrom on condition that he shall report to the Board for after-care and follow-up for a period not exceeding eighteen months under such terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Board. If at any time during the after-care and follow-up period the Board certifies to his complete rehabilitation, the court shall enter an order discharging him. Should the Board find at any time during the after-care and follow-up that he requires further treatment and rehabilitation in the center, it shall make a report to this effect to the court which shall thereupon order his recommitment to the center.
""A confidential record of the proceedings shall be kept by the Ministry of Justice and shall not be used for any other purpose than as a basis for determining whether or not a person accused under the provisions of this Act is a first offender.
""Upon completion of the period of after-care and follow-up, the court shall enter an order to expunge all official records (other than the confidential record to be retained by the Ministry of Justice) relating to his case. Such an order, which shall be kept confidential shall restore the accused to his status prior to the case. He shall not be held thereafter, under any provision of law, to be guilty of perjury or of concealment or misrepresentation by reason of his failure to acknowledge the case or recite any fact related thereto in response to any inquiry made of him for any purpose.
""In the case of minors under sixteen years of age at the time of the commission of any offense penalized under this Act, the provisions of Article 80 of the Revised Penal Code shall apply, without prejudice to the application of the provisions of this Section.
""Should the parents or guardian refuse to cooperate with the Board, or in any manner, prevent or delay the after-care and follow-up of the child or ward, as the case may be, they may be cited for contempt of court.""
