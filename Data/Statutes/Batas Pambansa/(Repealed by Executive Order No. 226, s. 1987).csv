This payment may be deferred to the succeeding year only, subject to the payment of interest. The importation of machinery and equipment and accompanying spare parts shall comply with the following conditions:

""(3)	The approval of the Board was obtained by the registered enterprise for the importation of such machinery, equipment and spare parts.

""In granting the approval of the importations under this paragraph, the Board may require international canvassing but if the total cost of the capital equipment or industrial plant exceeds US$5,000,000, the Board shall apply or adopt the provisions of Presidential Decree Numbered 1764 on international competitive bidding.
