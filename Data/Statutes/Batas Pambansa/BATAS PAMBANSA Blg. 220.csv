RULE IIIMINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIALIZED HOUSING
Section 4. Compliance with standards required. Development of economic and socialized housing project shall be in accordance with the minimum design standards herein set forth.
Section 5. Basis and objectives of the minimum design standards. The minimum design standards set forth herein are intended to provide minimum requirements within the generally accepted levels of safety, health and ecological considerations. Variations, however are also possible, as may be based on some specific regional, cultural and economic setting, e.g., building materials, space requirements and usage. The parameters used in formulating these Design Standards are:

A. Protection and safety of life, limb, property and general public welfare.
B. Basic needs of human settlements, enumerated in descending order as follows:

1) Water
2) Movement and Circulation
3) Storm drainage
4) Solid and Liquid Waste Disposal
5) Power
6) Park/Playground
The provision of these basic needs shall be based on the actual setting within which the project site is located.

C. Affordability levels of target market
D. Location

The Actual setting of project site shall determine the type and degree of development to be required in a subdivision/housing project regardless of political boundaries. With respect to this, the degree on level of development shall be defined as follows:

1) Underdeveloped Area characterized by the predominant absence of utility systems or networks, especially water supply, roads and power.
2) Developed Area characterized by the predominant presence of utility systems or network, especially water supply, roads and power.

Section 6. Technical Guidelines. In determining whether an economic and socialized housing shall be allowed, the following guidelines shall be considered.

A. Suitability of Site

1. Physical Suitability
A potential site must have characteristics assuring healthful, safe and environmentally sound community life. It shall be stable enough to accommodate foundation load without excessive site works. Critical areas (e.g., areas subject to flooding, lands slides and street) must be avoided.
2. Slope
Flat to rolling terrain (0 to 5%) are preferable but housing development may take place up to 15% slopes, with flat lands (below 5%) for high density development and sloping area (5-15%) for low to medium density development. The latter slopes, however, should be capable of being developed for habitation at reasonable cost with assurance of stability for vertical construction.
3. Availability of basic needs
The prioritized basic needs cited earlier shall preferably be available within reasonable distance from the project site, but where these are not available, the same shall be provided for by the developer.
4. Conformity with the Zoning Ordinance or Land Use Plan of the City/Municipality
Generally, housing projects should conform with the Zoning Ordinance of the city/municipality where they are located. However, where there is no Zoning Ordinance or Land Use Plan, the dominant land use principle and site suitability factors cited herein shall be used in determining suitability of a project to a site.
Furthermore, if the project is undoubtedly supportive of other land uses and activities, (e.g., housing for industrial workers) said project shall be allowed.

B. Allowance for future development
Project design should consider not only the reduction of cost of development to a minimum but also provision for possible future improvement or expansion, as in the prescription of lot sizes, rights-of-way of roads, open space, allocation of areas for common uses and facilities.
C. Land Allocation

1. Saleable and non-saleable are
There shall be no fixed ratio between saleable portion and non-saleable portion of a subdivision project.
2. Area allocated for Circulation System
The area allocated for the circulation system shall not be fixed, as long as the prescribed dimension and requirements for access (to both the project site and to dwelling units) specified in these Design Standards are complied with.
3. Area allocated for community facilities
Sites for community facilities shall be reserved or allocated by the developer, where such facilities may be constructed/put up the Homeowners Association as the need arises. Said sites shall be used exclusively for these facilities as defined in Rule II, and the area shall be exclusive of that area intended for park/playground.
The area allocated for community facilities shall vary with the density of the subdivision, i.e., number of lots and/or living units whichever is applicable, as shown in Table I.

Community facilities shall be centrally located where they can serve maximum member of population, preferably near or side by side the park/playground.
4. Area allocated for Park/Playground
Provision for park/playground is required in all cases.
Allocation of areas for parks and playgrounds shall be exclusive of those allocated for community facilities and shall vary according to the density of lots and/or living units in the subdivision, whichever is applicable, as shown in Table 2.

Location of parks shall be based on hierarchy, accessibility and shall be free from hazard, risks, barriers, etc.
Landscaping (sodding and tree-planting) shall be done by the subdivision developer/owner.
Minimum size for a pocket park is 100 square meters.
D. Integration of project site with adjacent property and to the total development context of the city/municipality.
Land allocation and alignment of the various utilities (roads, drainage, power and water) of the subdivision should align and be integrated with those of existing networks as well as projects outside the boundaries of the project site, e.g., access roads (road connecting project site to the nearest public road) should follow the standard specification of the MPWH.
Hierarchy of roads (with respect to function and dimensions) shall be observed when planning the road network within the project site such that no major or minor road align with an alley or footpath.


Section 7. Design Standards and Planning Considerations. The following design standards and planning considerations shall be observed by all projects covered by these Rules.

A. Water Supply

1. Underdeveloped Area
Minimum requirement shall be provision of communal wells.
Water supply must be potable and adequate at least 43 liters per capita per day. Supply source shall be identified and developed by the project developer/owner.
Whenever a body of water shall be utilized for community waters supply, permits from the National Water Resource Council (NMRC) shall be obtained. Standards set by the Regional Water Resource Council (RWRC) on water source development shall be complied with. Each well shall be allocated approximately four (4) square meters area which shall form part of the area for community facilities (as defined in Rule II) and shall not encroach on any saleably lot or right of way.
2. Developed Area
Whenever a public water supply system exists, connection to it by the subdivision is mandatory. Each lot and/or living unit shall be served with water connection (regardless of the type of distribution system). Water supply provided by the local water district shall be complemented/supplemented by other sources, when necessary, such as communal well which may be located strategically for ease and convenience in fetching water by residents and at the same time not closer than 300 meters from each other.
If public water supply system is not available, the developer shall provide for an independent water supply system within the subdivision project. Minimum quantity requirement shall be 75 liters per capita per day.
Likewise, required permits from the NWRC shall be obtained and standards of the Local Water Utilities Administration shall be complied with.
If ground reservoir is to be put up, and area shall be allocated for this purpose (part of allocation for community facilities). The size shall depend on volume of water intended to be stored. Provide for protection from pollution namely, buffer of at least 25 meters from sources of pollution/contamination.
For elevated reservoir, structural design shall comply with accepted structural standards.

B. Circulation System

1. Circulation system shall be the same in both Underdeveloped Area and a Developed Area projects except for type of pavement which is adopted on regional or locational peculiarities of the project site.
