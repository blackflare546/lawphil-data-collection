In either case, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission shall be subject to the approval of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of the Philippines. The Monetary Board shall, however, have the power to promulgate its own rules on the monetary and credit aspects of commercial paper issues, which may include the imposition of ceilings on issues by any single borrower, and the authority to supervise the enforcement of such rules and to require issues of commercial papers to submit their financial statements and such periodic reports as may be necessary for such enforcement. As far as practicable, such financial statements and periodic reports, when required by both the Commission and the Monetary Board, shall be uniform.
(c) A record of the registration of securities shall be kept in a Register of Securities in which shall be recorded orders entered by the Commission with respect to such securities.

(b) The Commission may, from time to time and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed after public hearing, add to the foregoing any class of securities similar to these above-enumerated if it finds that the enforcement of this Act with respect to such securities is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors.

(1) At any judicial sale, or sale by an executor, administrator, guardian or receiver or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy.
(2) By or for the account of a pledge holder, or mortgagee, or any other similar lienholder selling or offering for sale or delivery in the ordinary course of business and not for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this Act, to liquidate a bona fide debt, a security pledged in good faith as security for such debt.
(3) An isolated transaction in which any security is sold, offered for sale, subscription or delivery by the owner thereof, or by his representative for the owners account, such sale or offer for sale, subscription or delivery not being made in the course of repeated and successive transactions of a like character by such owner, or on his account by such representative and such owner or representative not being the underwriter of such security.
(4) The distribution by a corporation, actively engaged in the business, authorized by its articles of incorporation, of securities to its stockholders or other security holders as a stock dividend or other distribution out of surplus; or the issuance of securities to the security holder or other creditors of a corporation in the process of a bona fide reorganization of such corporation made in good faith and not for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this Act, either in exchange for the securities of such security holders or claims of such creditors or partly for cash and partly in exchange for the securities or claims of such security holders or creditors; or the issuance of additional capital stock of a corporation sold or distributed by it among its own stockholders exclusively, where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly in connection with the sale or distribution of such increased capital stock.

Upon such conversion the par value of the security surrendered in such exchange shall be deemed the price at which the securities issued and delivered in such exchange are sold.
(8) Brokers transactions, executed upon customers orders on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market but not those made upon the solicitation by brokers of such orders.
(9) Subscriptions for shares of the capital stock of a corporation prior to the incorporation thereof under the Corporation Code, when no expense is incurred, or no commission, compensation or remuneration is paid or given in connection with the sale or disposition of such securities, and only when the purpose for soliciting, giving or taking, of such subscriptions is to comply with the requirements of such law as to the percentage of the capital stock of a proposed corporation which should be subscribed before it can be registered and duly incorporated.
(10) The exchange of securities by the issuer with its existing security holders exclusively, where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange.

(b) The Commission may, from time to time and subject to such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, exempt transactions other than those provided in the preceding paragraph, if it finds that the enforcement of the requirements of registration under this Act with respect to such transactions is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of the investors by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the public offering.
(c) A fee equivalent to one-tenth of one per centum of the maximum aggregate price or issued value of the securities shall be collected by the Commission for granting a general or particular exemption from the registration requirements of this Act. (6a)

Additional information or documents, including written information from an expert, may be required, or anyone of the above requirements may be dispensed with, depending on the necessity thereof for the protection of the public investors, or their applicability to the class of securities sought to be registered, as the case may be.
The registration statement shall be signed by the issuer, its principal executive officer, its principal operating officer, its principal financial officer, its comptroller or principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions. The written consent of the expert named as having certified any part of the registration statement or any document used in connection therewith shall also be filed.
Upon filing of the registration statement, the registrant shall pay to the Commission a fee of not more than one-tenth of one per centum of the maximum aggregate price at which such securities are proposed to be offered and the fact of such filing shall be immediately published by the Commission, at the expense of the registrant, in two newspapers of general circulation in the Philippines, once a week for two consecutive weeks, reciting that a registration statement for the sale of such security has been filed with it, and that the aforesaid registration statement, as well as the papers attached thereto, are open to inspection during business hours, by interested parties, and copies thereof, photostatic or otherwise, shall be furnished to every applicant at such reasonable charge as the Commission may prescribe.
Any interested party may file an opposition to the registration within ten days from the publication.
If after the completion of the aforesaid publication, the Commission finds that the registration statement together with all the other papers and documents attached thereto, is on its face complete and that the requirements and conditions for the protection of the investors have been complied with, and unless there are grounds to reject a registration statement as herein provided, it shall as soon as feasible enter an order making the registration effective, and issue to the registrant a permit reciting that such person, its brokers or agents, are entitled to offer the securities named in said certificate, with such terms and conditions as it may impose in the public interest and for the protection of investors.
The Commission shall, however, advise the public that the issuance of such permit shall not be deemed a finding by the Commission that the registration statement is true and accurate on its face or that it does not contain an untrue statement of fact or omit to state a material fact, or be held to mean that the Commission has in any way given approval to the security included in the registration statement. Every permit and any other statement, printed or otherwise, for public consumption, that makes reference to such permit shall clearly and distinctively state that the issuance thereof is only permissive and does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement of the securities permitted to be offered for sale. It shall be unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser any representation contrary to the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Commission, for the guidance of investors, may require issuers to submit their securities to rating by securities rating agencies accredited by the Commission, to provide all information necessary therefor, and to report such rating in the registration statement and prospectus, if any, offering the securities.
If any change occurs in the facts set forth in the registration statement, it shall be the obligation of the issuer, dealer or underwriter who filed the original registration statement to submit to the Commission for approval an amended registration statement.
The Commission, in its order, may fix the maximum amount of commission or other form of remuneration to be paid in cash or otherwise, directly or indirectly, for or in connection with the sale or offering for sale of such securities in the Philippines and the maximum amount of compensation which the issuer shall pay for mining claims and mineral rights for which provision is made by the issuer for payment in cash or securities. The amount of compensation which shall be paid the owner or holder of such mining claims or mineral rights shall be a fair valuation thereof, as may be fixed by the Commission, after consultation with the Bureau of Mines, and after receiving such technical information as the issuer or dealer or the owner or owners of such claims may care to submit in the premises.
A copy of the order of the Commission making the registration effective, together with the registration statement, shall be transmitted to the exchange wherein the security may be listed and shall be available for inspection by any interested party during reasonable hours on any business day.
The order shall likewise be published, at the expense of the registrant, once in a newspaper of general circulation within ten days from its promulgation.
The same rules shall apply to any amendment to the registration statement. (7a)
Section 9. Grounds for the rejection of registration. The Commission may reject a registration statement and refuse to issue a permit to sell the securities included in such registration statement if it finds that

Section 10. Amendments to the registration statement.

(a) If a registration statement is on its face incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Commission may, after notice by personal service or the sending of confirmed telegraphic notice to the registrant, issue an order denying action on the registration statement until it has been amended in accordance with such order. When such statement has been amended in accordance with such order the Commission shall act on the amended registration in accordance with the procedure mentioned in Section eight hereof.
(b) An amendment filed after the effective date of the registration statement, shall become effective upon its approval by the Commission.
(c) If the registration statement includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Commission may, after notice by personal service or by sending a confirmed telegraphic notice by personal service or by sending a confirmed telegraphic notice and after opportunity for hearing has been granted, issue an order suspending the effectivity of the registration statement. If the statement is amended in accordance with requirements, the suspension order shall be lifted.
(d) The Commission may conduct an examination in any case in order to determine whether an order should issue under subsection (c) hereof. In making such examination the Commission or any officer or officers designated by it shall have access to, and may demand the production of, any books and records of, and may administer oaths and affirmations to and examine, the issuer, underwriter, or any other person, in respect of any matter relevant to the examination, and may in its discretion, require the production of the corporate books and records, showing, among others, its assets and liabilities and income statement of the issuer, certified to by a certified public accountant. Failure of the issuer or underwriter to cooperate, or his obstruction or refusal to undergo an examination, shall be a ground for the issuance of a suspension order. (n)

Section 11. Periodic and other reports. (a) Every issuer of a security registered pursuant to this Act shall file with the Commission


(1) Such information and documents as shall keep reasonably current the information and documents required to be included in or filed with an application or registration statement filed;
(2) Such annual reports and such periodicals and other reports as may be necessary to update information on the operation of the business of the issuer or registrant; and
(3) Such copies of all circulars, prospectuses, and other advertising matter, before or at the time of their issuance for publication, as the issuer or any person acting for him may issue from time to time, which shall in all cases fully set forth the amount and nature of the fees or expenses, payable in cash or securities, for goodwill, organization or promotion and such other matters as may be necessary for the protection of investors.
Every issuer of a security registered with an exchange shall file a duplicate original of such information, documents, and reports with the exchange.

(c) If any report required under subsection (a) is inapplicable to any specified class or classes of issuers such reports of comparable character as may be applicable to such class or classes of issuers shall be submitted in lieu thereof. (11a)

Section 12. Civil liabilities on account of false registration statement. (a) Any person acquiring a security, the registration statement of which or any part thereof contains on its effectivity an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make such statements not misleading, and who suffers damage, unless it is proved that at the time of such acquisition he knew of such untrue statement or omission, may sue in a court of competent jurisdiction:


(1) Every person who signed the registration statement;
(2) Every person who was a director of, or any other person performing similar functions, or a partner in, the issuer at the time of the filing of the registration statement or any part, supplement or amendment thereof with respect to which his liability is asserted;
(3) Every person who is named in the registration statement as being or about to become a director of, or a person performing similar functions, or a partner in, the issuer and whose written consent thereto is filed with the registration statement;
(4) Every person whose profession gives authority to a statement made by him, who with his written consent, which shall be filed with the registration statement, has been named as having prepared or certified any part of the registration statement, or as having prepared or certified any report or valuation which is used in connection with the registration statement, with respect to the statement in such registration statement, report, or valuation, which purports to have been prepared or certified by him.
(5) Every underwriter with respect to such security.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) no person, other than the issuer, shall be liable as provided therein if he proves

(1) That before the effective date of the part of the registration statement with respect to which his liability is asserted (A) he had resigned from or had taken such steps as are permitted by law to resign from, or ceased or refused to act in, every office, capacity, or relationship in which he was described in the registration statement as acting or agreeing to act, and (B) he had advised the Commission and the issuer in writing that he had taken such action and that he would not be responsible for such part of the registration statement; or
(2) That (A) as regards any part of the registration statement not purporting to be a copy of or extract from a report or valuation of an expert, and not purporting to be made on the authority of a public official document or statement, he had, after reasonable investigation, reasonable ground to believe and did believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements therein were true and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and (B) as regards any part of the registration statement purporting to be made upon his authority as an expert or purporting to be a copy of or extract from a report or valuation of himself as an expert, (i) he had, after reasonable investigation, reasonable ground to believe and did believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements therein were true and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) such part of the registration statement did not fairly represent his statement as an expert or was not a fair copy of or extract from his report or valuation as an expert; and (C) as regards any part of the registration statement purporting to be made on the authority of an expert (other than himself) or purporting to be a copy of or extract from a report or valuation of an expert (other than himself), he had no reasonable ground to believe and did not believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements therein were untrue or that there was an omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that such part of the registration statement did not fairly represent the statement of the expert or was not a fair copy of or extract from the report or valuation of the expert; and (D) as regards any part of the registration statement purporting to be a statement made by a public official or purporting to be a copy of or extract from a public official document, he had no reasonable ground to believe and did not believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements therein were untrue, or that there was an omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that such part of the registration statement did not fairly represent the statement made by the public official or was not a fair copy of or extract from the public official document.

(c) In determining, for the purpose of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this Section, what constitutes reasonable investigation and reasonable ground for belief, the standard of reasonableness shall be that required of a prudent man in the management of his own property.
(d) The suit authorized under subsection (a) may be filed to recover such damages as shall represent double the difference between the amount paid and committed to be paid for the security, not exceeding the price at which the security was offered to the public, and (1) the value thereof as of the time such suit was brought, or in case the security has been disposed of, (2) the price at which such security shall have been disposed of in the market before the suit, or (3) the price at which such security shall have been disposed of after the filing of the suit but before judgment. No underwriter shall be liable in any suit or as a consequence of suits authorized under subsection (a) hereof for damages in excess of the total price at which the securities underwritten by him and distributed to the public were offered to the public.
In any suit under this or any other section of this Act, the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit, including reasonable attorneys fees. Costs may be allowed by the Court to the prevailing party litigant in accordance with Rule 142 of the Rules of Court.
Exemplary damages may also be awarded in cases of bad faith, fraud, malevolence or wantonness in the violation of this Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(e) The persons specified in subsection (a) hereof shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of damages. However, any person who becomes liable for the payment of such damages may recover contribution from any other person who, if sued separately, would have been liable to make the same payment, unless the former was guilty of fraudulent representation and the latter was not.
(f) In no case shall the amount recoverable under this Section exceed double the price at which the security was offered to the public and such exemplary damages as may be awarded by the court.
(g) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, all persons, including the issuer, held liable under this Section, shall contribute equally to the total liability adjudged herein. In no case shall the principal stockholders, directors and other officers of the issuer or persons occupying similar positions therein, recover their contribution to the liability from the issuer. However, the right of the issuer to recover from the guilty parties the amount it has contributed under this Section shall not be prejudiced. (n)

Section 13. Civil liabilities arising in connection with prospectuses, communications and reports. (a) Any person who


(1) offers to sell or sells a security in violation of Chapter II, or
(2) offers to sell or sells a security, whether or not exempted by the provisions of this Act, by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication, by means of a prospectus or oral communication, which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the purchaser not knowing of such untruth or omission, and who shall fail in the burden of proof that he did not known, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of such untruth or omission, shall be liable to the person purchasing such security from him, who may sue, in any court of competent jurisdiction, to recover the consideration paid for such security with interest thereon, less the amount of any income received thereon, upon the tender of such security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security.
Exemplary damages may likewise be awarded in cases of bad faith, fraud, malevolence or wantonness.
(b) Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any report, or document filed pursuant to this Chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder, which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person who, not knowing that such statement was false or misleading, and relying upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. In any such suit the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees against either party litigant.

Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this subsection may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same payment. (n)

Section 14. Limitation of actions. (a) No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under Section 12 or Section 13 of this Act unless brought within two years after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or, if the action is to enforce a liability created under Section 13(a) (1), unless brought within two years after the violation upon which it is based. In no event shall any such action be brought to enforce a liability created under Section 12 of 13(a) (1) more than five years after the security was bona fide offered to the public, or under Section 13(a) (2) more than five years after the sale.

(b) No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under Section 13(b) or any other provision of this Act unless brought within two years after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within five years after such cause of action and within five years after such cause of action accrued. (n)

Section 15. Suspension of registration. If, at any time, the information contained in the statement filed is or has become misleading, incorrect, inadequate or incomplete, or the sale or offering for sale of the security may work or tend to work a fraud, the Commission may require from the person filing such statement such further information as may in its judgment be necessary to enable the Commission to ascertain whether the registration of such security should be revoked on any ground specified in this Act, and the Commission may also suspend the right to sell such security pending further investigation, by entering an order specifying the grounds for such action, and by notifying by mail or personally or by telephone confirmed in writing, or by telegraph, the person filing such statement and every dealer and broker who shall have notified the Commission of an intention to sell such security. The refusal to furnish information required by the Commission, within a reasonable time to be fixed by the Commission, may be a proper ground for the entry of such order of suspension. Upon the entry of any such order of suspension, no further sales of such security shall be made until the Commission orders otherwise. Any such sale shall be void.
In the event of the entry of such order of suspension, the Commission shall give a prompt hearing to the parties interested. If upon such hearing, the Commission shall determine that the sale of any such security should be revoked on any ground specified in this Act, it shall make the necessary findings and enter a final order prohibiting sales of such security. Until the entry of such final order, the suspension of the right to sell, though binding upon the persons notified thereof, shall be deemed confidential, and shall not be published, unless it shall appear that the order of suspension has been violated after notice. If however, upon such hearing the Commission finds that the sale of the security will neither be fraudulent nor result in fraud, it shall forthwith enter an order revoking such order of suspension, and such security shall be restored to its status as a security registered under this Act, as of the date of such order of suspension. (n)
Section 16. Revocation of registration of securities. (a) The Commission may, after due notice and hearing, revoke the registration of any security and the permit to sell such security by issuing an order to this effect, setting forth its findings in respect thereto, if upon examination it shall appear that the issuer:

(1) Is insolvent;
(2) Has violated any of the provisions of this Act, or the rules promulgated pursuant thereto, or any order of the Commission of which the issuer has notice;
(3) Has been or is engaged or is about to engage in fraudulent transactions;
(4) Is in any other way dishonest or has made any fraudulent representation in any prospectus or in any circular or other literature that has been distributed concerning the issuer of its securities; or
(5) Does not conduct its business in accordance with law.

The Commission may compel the production of all the books and papers of such issuer, and may administer oaths to, and examine the officers of such issuer or any other person connected therewith as to its business and affairs, and may also require a balance sheet exhibiting the assets and liabilities of any such issuer or his income statement or both to be certified to by an independent certified public accountant.
Whenever the Commission may deem it necessary, it may also require the submission of such balance sheet or income or profit statement, or both, with such particulars as the Commission shall point out or brought down to the latest practicable date.
If any issuer shall refuse to permit an examination to be made by the Commission, its refusal shall be proper ground for the revocation of the registration of and permission to sell its securities.
If the Commission deems it necessary, it may issue an order suspending the right to sell securities pending any investigation. The order shall state the grounds for taking such action, but such order of suspension, although binding upon the persons notified thereof, shall be deemed confidential, and shall not be published. Upon the issuance of the suspension order, no further sale of such security shall be made until the same is lifted or set aside by the Commission. Any such sale shall be void.
Notice of issuance of such order shall be given by mail, or personally, or by telephone, confirmed in writing, or by telegram, to the issuer and every dealer and broker who shall have notified the Commission of an intention to sell such security.
(b) A registration statement may be revoked by the Commission upon petition made for its withdrawal by the issuer only with the consent of the Commission and in accordance with such rules and regulations which the Commission may prescribe: Provided, That no party stands to suffer damage thereby. (12a)
Section 17. Promotion fees. If the statement containing information as to securities to be registered, as provided for in Section eight of this Act, shall disclose that any such securities or any securities senior thereto shall have been or shall be intended to be issued for goodwill, or for organization or promotion fees or expenses, or that payment in cash shall have been or will be made for organization or promotion fees or expenses or for goodwill, the amount and nature thereof shall be fully set forth in the notification published by the Commission as required in Section 8 of this Act, and in all prospectuses, circulars, or other advertisements of the issuer, and should also appear upon the face or on the back of the security itself. (13)
Section 18. Substituted service upon the Commission. Whenever service of summons or other process shall be made upon the Commission in actions or legal proceedings against an issuer or any person liable under this Act who is not domiciled in the Philippines or is not formed, organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines, the Commission shall within ten (10) days thereafter, transmit by registered mail a copy of such summons and the complaint or other legal process to such issuer or person at his last known address or principal office. The sending thereof by the Commission, the expenses for which shall be advanced by the party at whose instance it is made, shall complete such service. (10a)
CHAPTER IIIBrokers, Dealers and Salesmen
Section 19. Registration of brokers, dealers and salesmen. No broker, dealer or salesman shall engage in business in the Philippines as such broker, dealer or salesman or sell any securities, including securities exempted under this Act, except in exempt transactions, unless he has been registered as a broker, dealer, or salesman pursuant to the provisions of this Section.
An application for registration in writing shall be filed in the office of the Commission in such form as the Commission may prescribe, duly verified under oath, which shall state the principal office of the applicant, wherever situated and its principal office and all branch offices in the Philippines, if any; the name or style of doing business; the corporate or business names; residences and business addresses of all persons interested in the business as principals, co-partners, officers and directors, specifying as to each his capacity and title; and the character of the business and the length of time the applicant has been engaged in said business. The Commission may also require such additional information, under oath, as to applicants previous history, record and connection with other companies, as it may deem necessary to establish the good repute in business of the applicant.
There shall be filed with such application an irrevocable written consent to the service of process upon the Commission in actions against such broker or dealer in the manner and form as herein provided.
If the Commission finds that the applicant is of good repute and has complied with the provisions of this Act, including the payment of the fee herein provided, it shall register such applicant as a broker or dealer upon his filing a bond, or other security in lieu thereof, in such sum as may be fixed by the Commission which it may deem adequate for the protection of the public, running to the Government of the Philippines, and conditioned upon the faithful compliance with the provisions of this Act by said broker or dealer and by all salesmen registered by the latter while acting for him. Such bond shall be executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the Philippines. In lieu of such bond, he may file bonds of the Government of the Philippines. If a bond is filed, any person damaged by the failure of such broker or dealer or of any salesman registered by the latter while acting for him, to comply with the provisions of this Act, shall be entitled to sue the sureties under such bond and to recover the damages so suffered thereunder. If other securities are filed in lieu thereof, such person may subject such securities to the payment of such damage.
Upon the written application of a registered dealer or broker and general satisfactory showing as to good character and the payment of the fee prescribed in this Act, the Commission shall register as salesman of such dealer or broker such natural person as the dealer or broker may request. Such registration shall cease upon the termination of employment of such salesman by such dealer or broker.
The names and addresses of all persons approved for registration as brokers, dealers or salesmen and all orders with respect thereto shall be recorded in a Register of Brokers, Dealers and Salesmen kept in the office of the Commission which shall be open to public inspection. Every registration under this Section shall expire on the thirty-first day of December in each year, but new registration for the succeeding year shall be issued upon written application and upon payment of the fee as hereinafter provided, without filing of further statements or furnishing any further information unless specifically required by the Commission. Application for renewals must be made not less than thirty nor more than sixty days before the first day of the ensuing year, otherwise they shall be treated as original applications. The fee for such registration and for each annual renewal shall be in such reasonable amount as may be determined by the Commission.
Changes in registration occasioned by changes in the personnel of a partnership or in the principals, co-partners, officers or directors of any broker or dealer may be made from time to time by written application setting forth the facts with respect to such change.
Every registered broker or dealer who intends to offer any security for sale shall notify the Commission in writing of his intention to do so. The notice shall contain the name of the broker or dealer and shall state the name of the security to be offered for sale. Whenever a broker or dealer shall have prepared such notice and shall have forwarded the same by registered mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the Commission, such dealer or broker, as to the contents of such notice and the filing thereof, shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this paragraph. Any issuer of a security required to be registered under the provisions of this Act, selling such securities except in exempt transactions as defined in this Act, shall be deemed a dealer within the meaning of this Section and required to comply with all the provisions hereof. (14a)
Section 20. Revocation of brokers, dealers and salesmans registration. Registration under this Act may be refused, or any registration granted may be revoked, by the Commission if, after reasonable notice and hearing, the Commission determines that such applicant or registrant so registered:

(1) Has violated any provision of this Act or any regulation made hereunder; or
(2) Has made a material false statement in the application for registration; or
(3) Has been guilty of a fraudulent act in connection with any sale of securities, or has been or is engaged or is about to engage in making fictitious or pretended sales or purchases of any of such securities or has been or is engaged or is about to engage in any practice or sale of securities which is fraudulent or in violation of the law; or
(4) Has demonstrated his unworthiness to transact the business of broker, dealer or salesman.

In cases of charges against a salesman, notice thereof shall also be given the broker or dealer employing such salesman.
Pending the hearing, the Commission shall have the power to order the suspension of such brokers, dealers or salesmans registration: Provided, That such order shall state the cause for such suspension.
Until the entry of a final order, the suspension of such brokers or dealers registration, though binding upon the persons notified thereof, shall be deemed confidential, and shall not be published, unless it shall appear that the order of suspension has been violated after notice.
The order of the Commission refusing or revoking a registration as hereinabove provided, together with its findings, shall be entered in the Register of Brokers, Dealers and Salesmen. The suspension or revocation of the registration of a dealer or broker shall also automatically suspend or revoke the registration of all his salesmen.
It shall be sufficient cause for refusal or cancellation of registration in case of a partnership or corporation, if any member of a partnership or any officer or director of the corporation or association has been guilty of any act or omission which would be cause for refusing or revoking the registration of an individual dealer, broker or salesman. (15a)
CHAPTER IV
Trading in Securities
Section 21. Use of facilities of unregistered exchange prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any broker, dealer, salesman or exchange, directly or indirectly, to make use of any facility of an exchange in the Philippines to effect any transaction in a security or to report such transaction, unless a registration is effective as to such security or such security is exempted from registration under the provisions of this Act and such exchange is registered as a securities exchange under this Act, or is exempted from such registration upon application by the exchange because, in the opinion of the Commission, by reason of the limited volume of transactions effected on the exchange, it is not practicable and not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to require such registration. (16a)
Section 22. Registration of exchange. (a) Any exchange may be registered with the Commission as an exchange under the terms and conditions hereinafter provided in this Section, by filing a registration statement in such form as the Commission may prescribe, setting forth the information and accompanied by the following supporting documents below specified:


(1) An undertaking to comply and enforce compliance by its members with the provisions of this Act, and any amendment thereto, and the implementing rules or regulations made or to be made thereunder;
(2) Such data as to its organization, rules of procedure, and membership, and such other information as the Commission may, by rules and regulations, require as being necessary or appropriate for the public interest or for the protection of investors;
(3) Copies of its constitution, articles of incorporation with all amendments thereto, and of its existing by-laws or rules or instruments corresponding thereto whatever be the name, which are hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""rules of the exchange"";
(4) An undertaking to furnish to the Commission copies of any amendments to the rules of the exchange forthwith upon their adoption; and
(5) An undertaking that in the event a member firm becomes insolvent or when the exchange shall have found that the financial condition of its member firm has so deteriorated that it cannot readily meet the demands of its customers for the delivery of securities and/or payment of sales proceeds, the exchange shall, upon order of the Commission, take over the operation of the insolvent member firm and immediately proceed to settle the member firms liabilities to its customers: Provided, That stock exchanges in operation upon the effectivity of this Act shall have one year within which to submit the undertaking;

(b) No registration of an exchange shall be granted or remain in force unless the rules thereof include provision for the expulsion, suspension, or disciplining of a member for conduct or proceeding inconsistent with just and equitable principles of fair trade.
(c) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent any exchange from adopting and enforcing any rule not inconsistent with this Act and with the rules and regulations thereunder, or with any other law.
(d) If it appears to the Commission that the exchange applying for registration is so organized as to be able to comply with the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the exchange are just and adequate to insure fair dealing and to protect investors, the Commission shall cause such exchange to be registered as a securities exchange.
(e) Within ninety days after the filing of the application the Commission may issue an order either granting or, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, denying registration as a securities exchange, unless the exchange applying for registration shall withdraw its application or shall consent to the Commissions deferring action on its application for a stated longer period after the date of filing. The filing with the Commission of an application for registration by an exchange shall be deemed to have taken place upon the receipt thereof. Amendments to an application may be made upon such terms as the Commission may prescribe.
(f) Upon the registration of a securities exchange pursuant to the provisions of this Act, it shall pay within twelve (12) months such reasonable fee as the Commission may fix.
(g) Upon appropriate application in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Commission and upon such terms as the Commission may deem necessary for the protection of investors, an exchange may withdraw its registration or suspend its operations or resume the same. (17a)

Section 23. Margin Requirements. (a) For the purpose of preventing the excessive use of credit for the purchase or carrying of securities, the Commission, in accordance with the credit and monetary policies that may be promulgated from time to time by the Monetary Board, shall prescribe rules and regulations with respect to the amount of credit that may be extended on any security other than an exempted security. For the extension of credit, such rules and regulations shall be based upon the following standard:

An amount not greater than whichever is the higher of

(1) Sixty-five (65%) per centum of the current market price of the security, or
(2) One hundred (100%) per centum of the lowest market price of the security during the preceding thirty-six calendar months, but not more than seventy-five (75%) per centum of the current market price.

However, the Monetary Board, by an affirmative vote of five (5) of its members, may increase or decrease the above percentages, in order to achieve the objectives of the Central Bank during an economic crisis or national emergency.
Such rules and regulations may make appropriate provision with respect to the carrying of undermargined accounts for limited periods and under specified conditions; the withdrawal of funds or securities; the transfer of accounts from one lender to another; special or different margin requirements for delayed deliveries, short sales, arbitrage transactions, and securities to which number 2 of the second paragraph of this subsection does not apply; the bases and the methods to be used in calculating loans, and margins and market prices; and similar administrative adjustments and details.
(b) It shall be unlawful for any member of an exchange or any broker or dealer, directly or indirectly, to extend or maintain credit or arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit to or for any customer

(1) On any security other than an exempted security, in contravention of the rules and regulations which the Commission shall prescribe under subsection (a) of this Section;
(2) Without collateral or on any collateral other than securities, except (i) to maintain a credit initially extended in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Commission and (ii) in cases where the extension or maintenance of credit is not for the purpose of purchasing or carrying securities or of evading or circumventing the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this subsection.

(c) It shall be unlawful for any person not subject to subsection (b) hereof to extend or maintain credit or to arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any security, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe to prevent the excessive use of credit for the purchasing or carrying of or trading in securities in circumvention of the other provisions of this Section. Such rules and regulations may impose upon all loans made for the purpose or purchasing or carrying securities limitations similar to those imposed upon members, brokers, or dealers by subsection (b) of this Section and the rules and regulations thereunder.

However, the Commission, having due regard to the protection of investors, may, by rules and regulations, allow certain transactions that may otherwise be prohibited under this subsection.

To prevent indirect violations of the margin requirements under Section 23 hereof, the broker or dealer shall require the customer in nonmargin transactions to pay the price of the security purchased for his account within such period as the Commission may prescribe, which shall in no case exceed three trading days; otherwise, the broker shall sell the security purchased starting on the next trading day but not beyond ten trading days following the last day for the customer to pay such purchase price, unless such sale cannot be effected within said period for justifiable reasons. The sale shall be without prejudice to the right of the broker or dealer to recover any deficiency from the customer.

Section 30. Insiders duty to disclose when trading. (a) It shall be unlawful for an insider to sell or buy a security of the issuer, if he knows a fact of special significance with respect to the issuer or the security that is not generally available, unless (1) the insider proves that the fact is generally available or (2) if the other party to the transaction (or his agent) is identified, (a) the insider proves that the other party knows it, or (b) that other party in fact knows it from the insider or otherwise.

(b) ""Insider"" means (1) the issuer, (2) a director or officer of, or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the issuer, (3) a person whose relationship or former relationship to the issuer gives or gave him access to a fact of special significance about the issuer or the security that is not generally available, or (4) a person who learns such a fact from any of the foregoing insiders as defined in this subsection, with knowledge that the person from whom he learns the fact is such an insider.

(1) a member to be registered as an odd-lot dealer and as such to buy and sell for his own account so far as may be reasonably necessary to carry on such odd-lot transactions, or
(2) a member to be registered as a specialist. If under the rules and regulations of the Commission, a specialist is permitted to act as a dealer, or is limited to acting as a dealer, such rules and regulations shall restrict his dealing so far as practicable to those reasonably necessary to permit him to maintain a fair and orderly market, and/or to those necessary to permit him to act as an odd-lot dealer.

It shall also be unlawful for a specialist acting as a broker to effect on the exchange any transaction except upon a market or limited price order.

(c) If, because of the limited volume of transactions effected on an exchange, it is impracticable and not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to apply any of the foregoing provisions of this Section or the rules and regulations thereunder, the Commission shall have the power, upon application of the exchange and on a showing that the rules of such exchange are otherwise adequate for the protection of investors, to exempt such exchange and its members from any such provision or rules and regulations.
(d) It shall be unlawful for a member of a securities exchange who is both a dealer and a broker, or for any person who both as a broker and a dealer transacts a business in securities through the medium of a member or otherwise, to effect through the use of any facility of a securities exchange, or otherwise in the case of a member

(1) Any transaction in connection with which, directly or indirectly, he extends or maintains or arranges for the extension or maintenance of credit to or for a customer on any security other than an exempted security which was a part of a new issue in the distribution of which he participated as a member of a selling syndicate or group within six months prior to such transaction: Provided, That credit shall not be deemed extended by reason of a bona fide delayed delivery of any such security against full payment of the entire purchase price thereof upon such delivery within thirty-five days after such purchase, or
(2) Any transaction with respect to any security other than an exempted security unless, if the transaction is with a customer, he discloses to such customer in writing at or before the completion of the transaction whether he is acting as a dealer for his own account, as a broker for such customer, or as a broker for some other person. (22a)


Section 32. Reports. (a) (1) Any person who, after acquiring directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any equity security of a class which is registered pursuant to this Act, is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than ten (10%) per centum of such class shall, within ten days after such acquisition or such reasonable time as fixed by the Commission, submit to the issuer of the security, to the stock exchanges where the security is traded, and to the Commission a sworn statement containing the following information and such other information, as the Commission may require in the public interest or for the protection of investors:




(i) The background, identity, residence, and citizenship of, and the nature of such beneficial ownership by, such person and all other persons by whom or on whose behalf the purchases are effected; in the event the beneficial owner is a juridical person, the line of business of the beneficial owner shall also be reported.
(ii) If the purpose of the purchases or prospective purchases is to acquire control of the business of the issuer of the securities, any plans or proposals which such persons may have that will effect a major change in its business or corporate structure; (iii) The number of shares of such security which are beneficially owned, and the number of shares concerning which there is a right to acquire, directly or indirectly, by (i) such person, and (ii) by each associate of such person, giving the background, identity, residence, and citizenship of each such associate; and
(iv) Information as to any contracts, arrangements, or understanding with any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including but not limited to transfers, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees or division of losses or profits, or proxies naming the persons with whom such contracts, arrangements, or understanding have been entered into, and giving the details thereof.

(2) If any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the statements, an amendment shall be transmitted to the issuer, the exchange and the Commission in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribed as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(3) The Commission, by rule or regulation or by order, may permit any person to file in lieu of the statement required by paragraph (1) of this subsection, a notice stating the name of such person, the shares or any equity securities subject to paragraph (1) which are owned by him, the date of their acquisition and such other information as the Commission may specify, if it appears to the Commission that such securities were acquired by such person in the ordinary course of his business and were not acquired for the purpose of and do not have the effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer nor in connection with any transaction having such purpose or effect.

(b) (1) It shall be unlawful for an issuer which has a class of equity securities registered pursuant to this Act, to purchase any equity security issued by it if such purchase is in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission, in the public interest or for the protection of investors, may adopt (a) to define acts and practices which are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative, and (b) to prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent such acts and practices. Such rules and regulations may require such issuer to provide holders of equity securities of such class with such information relating to the reasons for such purchase, the source of funds, the number of shares to be purchased, the price to be paid for such securities, the method of purchase, and such additional information as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, or which the Commission deems to be material to a determination whether such security should be purchased.

(2) For the purpose of this subsection, a purchase by or for the issuer or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the issuer, or a purchase subject to the control of the issuer or any such person, shall be deemed to be a purchase by the issuer. The Commission shall have the power to make rules and regulations implementing this paragraph in the public interest and for the protection of investors including exemptive rules and regulations covering situations in which the Commission deems it unnecessary or inappropriate that a purchase of the type described in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a purchase by the issuer for the purpose of some or all of the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection. (n)

Section 33. Tender offers. (a) (1) It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to make a tender offer for, or a request or invitation for tenders of, any class of any equity security which is registered pursuant to this Act if, after consummation thereof, such person would, directly or indirectly, be the beneficial owner of more than ten (10%) per centum of such class, or such reasonable percentage as fixed by the Commission, unless, at the time copies of the offer or request or invitation are first published or sent or given to security holders, such person has filed with the Commission and furnished the issuer a statement containing such of the information required in Section 32 of this Act as the Commission may prescribe. All requests or invitations for tender, or advertisements making a tender offer or requesting or inviting tenders of such a security, shall be filed as a part of such statement and shall contain such of the information contained in such statement as the Commission may prescribe. Copies of any additional material soliciting or requesting such tender offers subsequent to the initial solicitation or request shall contain such information as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, and shall be filed with the Commission and sent to the issuer not later than the time copies of such materials are first published or sent or given to security holders.


(2) Any solicitation or recommendation to the holders of such a security to accept or reject a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders shall be made in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(3) Securities deposited pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders may be withdrawn by or on behalf of the depositor at any time until the expiration of seven days after the time definitive copies of the offer or request or invitation are first published or sent or given to security holders, and at any time after sixty days from the date of the original tender offer or request or invitation, except as the Commission may otherwise prescribed by rules, regulations, or order as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(4) Where any person makes a tender offer, or request or invitation for tenders, for less than all the outstanding equity securities of a class, and where a greater number of securities is deposited pursuant thereto within ten days after copies of the offer or request or invitation are first published or sent or given to security holders than such person is bound or willing to take up and pay for, the securities taken up shall be taken up as nearly as may be pro rata, disregarding fractions, according to the number of securities deposited by each depositor. The provisions of this subsection shall also apply to securities deposited within ten days after notice of an increase in the consideration offered to security holders, as described in subparagraph (5) of this subsection, is first published or sent or given to security holders.
(5) Where any person varies the terms of a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders before the expiration thereof by increasing the consideration offered to holders of such securities, such person shall pay the increased consideration to each security holder whose securities are taken up and paid for whether or not such securities have been taken up by such person before the variation of the tender offer or request or invitation.

(b) The provisions of subsection (a) of Section 32 and subsection (a) of this Section shall not apply to any offer for, or request or invitation for tenders of, any security

(e) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or to engage in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, in connection with any tender offer or request or invitation for tenders, or any solicitation of security holders in opposition to or in favor of any such offer, request or invitation. The Commission shall, for the purposes of this subsection, by rules and regulations define, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent, such acts and practices as are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative. (n)

Section 34. Proxies. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, to solicit or to permit the use of his name to solicit any proxy or consent or authorization in respect of any security registered pursuant to this Act.

(24a)

(2) For any broker or dealer to use any facility of any such market.

Such rules and regulations may provide for the regulation of all transactions by brokers and dealers on any such market, for the registration with the Commission of dealers or brokers making or creating such a market, and for the registration of the securities for which they make or create a market, and may make special provision with respect to securities or specified classes thereof listed, or entitled to unlisted trading privileges, upon any exchange on the effective date of this Act, which securities are not registered under the provisions hereof.

Suit to recover such profit may be instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer, or by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and in behalf of the issuer if the issuer shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within sixty days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter; but no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized. This subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security involved, or any transaction or transactions which the Commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection.
(c) It shall be unlawful for any such beneficial owner, director, or officer, directly or indirectly, to sell any equity security of such issuer if the person selling the security or his principal (1) does not own the security sold, or (2) if owning the security, does not deliver it against such sale within twenty days thereafter, or does not within five days after such sale deposit it in the mails or other usual channels of transportation; but no person shall be deemed to have violated this subsection if he proves that notwithstanding the exercise of good faith he was unable to make such delivery or deposit within such time, or that to do so would cause undue inconvenience or expense.

(1) After appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, to suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months or to withdraw the registration of a securities exchange, if such exchange has violated any provision of this Act or of the rules and regulations thereunder, or has failed to enforce compliance therewith by a member or by an issuer of a security registered thereon.
