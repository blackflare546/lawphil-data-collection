""Where the enterprise is wholly or majority-owned by the bank, the Central Bank may subject it to examination.
""In order to avoid undue concentration of economic power, the total equity investments of banks, quasi-banks and their subsidiaries in a single enterprise or industry may be subject to such limitations as may be prescribed by the Monetary Board, but shall in any case remain a minority in any enterprise except as may be otherwise approved by the President (Prime Minister).
""For the purpose of determining compliance with the limitations on equity holdings by a bank in a non-allied undertaking, the equity holdings of the bank in the undertaking, when combined with those of its directors, officers and substantial stockholders, and its wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries shall not exceed the prescribed thirty-five percent (35%) of the equity of that undertaking. The same rule shall be observed in the case of an equity investment by a subsidiary wholly or majority-owned by the bank, where the investors in the undertaking consist of the subsidiary, the bank which owns the majority or all of the equity of the subsidiary, the officers, directors and substantial stockholders of the bank, as well as those of the subsidiary.
""The regulations issued by the Monetary Board to implement the provisions of this section and Section 21-C of this Act shall be reported to the President (Prime Minister) and to the Batasang Pambansa within fifteen days from the date of their issuance.

Section 13. Section 22 of the same Act is hereby further amended to read as follows:

The Monetary Board may, at its discretion, require that the ratio of net worth to risk assets be determined on the basis of the combined risk assets of the parent bank and its subsidiaries, financial or otherwise.
""Whenever the capital accounts of a bank are deficient with respect to the requirements of this Act, the Monetary Board, after considering a report of the appropriate supervising department on the state of solvency of the institution concerned, shall limit or prohibit the distribution of net profits and shall require that part or all of net profits be used to increase the capital accounts of the institution until the minimum requirement has been met. The Monetary Board may, furthermore, after considering the aforesaid report of the appropriate supervising department and if the amount of the deficiency justifies it, restrict or prohibit the making of new investments of any sort by the bank, with the exception of purchases of readily marketable evidences of indebtedness included under Subsection (c) of this Section, until the minimum required capital ratio has been restored.
""Where in the process of a bank merger or consolidation, the merged or constituent bank may not be able to comply fully with the net worth to risk assets ratio herein prescribed, the Monetary Board may, at its discretion, temporarily relieve the bank from full compliance with this requirement under such conditions as it may prescribe.""

""Notwithstanding any provision in any other Act to the contrary, savings and mortgage banks may lend money against the security of jewelry, precious stones and articles of similar nature, subject to such rules and regulations as the Monetary Board may prescribe.""
