CHAPTER IV - Exploitation and Prospecting for Mineral Deposits
Section 24. Prospectors may prospect for themselves, or for other persons, associations, corporations, or other entities, qualified to locate mining claims and to acquire leases of mineral lands under the provisions of this Act. A proper power of attorney in writing shall in each case be given by the employer to his prospector, which power of attorney shall be duly acknowledged and shall be recorded in the office of the mining recorder concerned coincident with the recording of a declaration of location. Regardless of the number of claims located by the prospector for the same principle in the same province or mining district, he shall be required to record but one power of attorney in any such province or district.
Section 25. Officers and employees of the executive or any other branch of the Government whose duties are related to the administration or disposition of mineral resources shall not be allowed to prospect, locate, lease, or hold, directly or indirectly, mineral lands in the Philippines.
Section 26. Prospecting may be carried on within public lands and private lands in accordance with the provisions of this Act: Provided, however, That in the case of private lands no prospecting shall be allowed except by the owner thereof during the period of one year from and after the effective date of this Act.
Section 27. Before entering private lands the prospector shall first apply in writing for written permission of the private owner, claimant, or holder thereof, and in case of refusal by such private owner, claimant, or holder to grant such permission, or in case of disagreement as to the amount of compensation to be paid for such privilege of prospecting therein, the amount of such compensation shall be fixed by agreement among the prospector, the Director of the Bureau of Mines and the surface owner, and in case of their failure to unanimously agree as to the amount of compensation, all questions at issue shall be determined by the Court of First Instance of the province in which said lands are situated in an action instituted for the purpose by the prospector, or his principal: Provided, however, That the prospector, or his principal upon depositing with the court the sum considered jointly by him and the Director of the Bureau of Mines or by the court to be just compensation for the damages resulting from such prospecting, shall be permitted to enter upon and locate the said land without such written permission pending final adjudication of the amount of such compensation; and in such case the prospector, or his principal, shall have a prior right as against the world, from the date of his application. The court in its final judgment, besides determining the corresponding compensation of the damages which may be caused by the prospecting, shall make a pronouncement as to the value of the land and the reasonable rental for the occupation and utilization thereof for mining purposes in case the prospector decides to locate and exploit the minerals found therein.
Section 28. No prospecting shall be allowed:

(a) In a mineral reserve which has been proclaimed closed to mining locations.
(b) In lands covered by patented mining claims.
(c) In lands in which minerals have been discovered prior to the effective date of this Act and are claimed by the discoverer or his successors in interest.
(d) In lands which have been located for mining leases by other prospectors under the provisions of this Act.
(e) Near or under buildings, cemeteries, bridges, highways, waterways, railroads, reservoirs, dams, or any other public or private works.

The regulations to be promulgated under this Act shall prescribe in detail the various restrictions under this section.
CHAPTER V - Discovery of Mineral Deposits and Location of Mining Claims
Section 29. The right to locate a mining claim shall in all cases be based upon the discovery of mineral therein.
Section 30. The finding of mineral or minerals in place or position where originally formed in the rock, whether assaying high or low, shall constitute a valid discovery for the location of a lode mineral claim. The finding of mineral or minerals in loose, fragmentary or broken rocks, boulders, floats, beds or deposits whether in greater or lesser quantities, or the finding of the same in forms other than those above described for lode mineral claims, shall constitute a valid discovery for the location of a placer mining claim.
Section 31. A lode mineral claim is a parcel of mineral land containing a vein, lode, ledge, lens, or mass of ore in place which has been located in accordance with law. A placer claim is that which does not come under the definition of lode mineral claim.
Section 32. In case of conflicting locations, priority of discovery, followed by continuous occupation and prospecting of the land, shall determine the right to lease the claims, subject to any question as to the validity of the location and record of the claim and subject to the holder's having complied with all the requirements of the law: Provided, however, That actual discovery of minerals made prior to the effective date of this Act, before or after the enforcement of the Constitution, shall constitute a valid discovery, and the persons making such discovery shall have the preferential right to locate and lease the mining claims covering the minerals discovered, subject to the provisions of this Act.
Section 33. Immediately upon the discovery of mineral or as soon as possible thereafter, but not more than thirty days after the date of the said discovery, the discoverer or locator may locate a mining claim in accordance with the provisions of this Act, covering the land where the mineral has been discovered. If no such location is made within such period, the right to locate a mining claim covering such land shall be deemed to have been waived.
Section 34. Within sixty days after the completion of the acts of location of a mining claim, as hereinafter provided, the locator thereof shall record the same with the mining recorder of the province or district within which the claim is situated. A claim which shall not have been recorded within the prescribed period shall be deemed to have been abandoned.
Section 35. The maximum area which may be acquired under a mining claim located under the provisions of this Act shall be:

First group:

(a) Metals or metalliferous ores in lode deposits, nine hectares for an individual, an unincorporated association, a sociedad anonima, a limited partnership or a corporation.
(b) Metals or metalliferous ores in placer deposits; not to exceed eight hectares for an individual nor sixty-four hectares for a corporation, sociedad anonima, or limited partnership: Provided, That in the case of an unincorporated association the area shall not exceed eight (8) hectares for each member, nor sixty-four (64) hectares for the entire association.

Second group:
Precious stones whether in lode or placer deposits, not to exceed four hectares for any qualified locator or applicant.
Fourth group:
Salines and mineral waters, not to exceed four hectares for any qualified locator or applicant.
Fifth group:

(a) Building stone, clay, fertilizer, and other non-metals in placer deposits not to exceed eight hectares for an individual nor sixty-four hectares for a corporation, sociedad anonima, or limited partnership; Provided, That in the case of an unincorporated association the area shall not exceed eight (8) hectares for each member nor sixty-four (64) hectares for the entire association.
(b) Nonmetals in lode deposit - not to exceed nine hectares for an individual, unincorporated association, a sociedad anonima, a limited partnership or a corporation.


Section 36. The disposition of the third group of mineral lands, or lands containing mineral fuels, whether public or private, shall be governed by Act Numbered Two thousand seven hundred nineteen, as amended, entitled ""An Act to provide for the leasing and development of coal lands in the Philippine Islands"" and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and by Act Numbered Two thousand nine hundred thirty-two, as amended, entitled, ""An Act to provide for the exploration, location and lease of lands containing petroleum and other mineral oils and gas in the Philippine Islands"" and the regulations promulgated thereunder: Provided, That the granting of permit, license, lease, or concession of such coal, or petroleum land, shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines of legal age, or to associations or to corporations organized and constituted under the laws of the Philippines: Provided, further, That the provisions of Acts Numbered Two thousand seven hundred and nineteen, as amended, and Two thousand nine hundred and thirty-two, as amended, to the contrary notwithstanding, at least sixty per centum of the capital of such association or corporation shall at all times be owned and held by citizens of the Philippines. All licenses, concessions, or leases for the exploitation, development, or utilization of such coal lands, or lands containing petroleum and other mineral oils and gas, shall be for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for another period not exceeding twenty-five years.
Section 37. In the case of the first, second, fourth, and fifth groups of mineral lands, no locator, applicant or lessee shall be entitled to hold or lease in his, its or their own names or in the name of any person, association, corporation, a sociedad anonima, or limited partnership more than three lode mineral claims on the same vein or lode, or more than three placer mining claims, in the case of an individual, or more than three placer mining claims in the case of a corporation, an association, a sociedad anonima, or a limited partnership on the same placer ground.
Section 38. Mining claims of the first, second, fourth, and fifth groups may be located either as lode or as placer claims, depending upon whether the mineral deposits therein are found in lode or in placer form: Provided, however, That if a parcel of land, by reason of the nature of the mineral deposits found therein, is subject to either lode or placer location, the prior location of either class, validly made, shall prevail: Provided, further, That in case a placer location is made first, the locator thereof must thereafter make a lode location in order to secure the mining rights to lode deposits found within the boundaries to all minerals of the group for which the mining location of the placer claim: Provided, further, That in case a placer location is made first, the locator, thereof must thereafter make a lode location in order to secure the mining rights to lode deposits found within the boundaries of the placer claim: Provided, further, That in such cases the locator, or his successors in interest, shall be entitled to all minerals of the group for which the mining location or locations have been made or the lease granted, which may lie within his claims, but he shall not be entitled to mine outside the boundary lines of his claim continued vertically downward: And provided, finally, That the holder or lessee shall have preferential right to locate and lease any mineral deposits of any other group found therein.
Section 39. Lode claims, whether located by one or more persons qualified to locate mining claims under this Act shall be located in the following manner and under the following conditions:
Any person so qualified desiring to locate a lode mineral claim shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, enter upon the same and locate a plat of ground, measuring not more than three hundred meters in length by three hundred meters in breadth, in as nearly as possible a rectangular form; that is to say, all angles shall be right angles, except in cases where the boundary line of a previously surveyed claim is adopted as common to both claims, but the lines need not necessarily be meridional. In defining the size of a mineral claim, it shall be measured horizontally irrespective of inequalities of the surface of the ground.
Section 40. A lode claim shall be marked by two posts, placed as nearly as possible on the line or direction of the lode or vein, and the posts shall be numbered one and two, and the distance between posts numbered one and two shall not exceed three hundred meters, the line between posts numbered one and two to be known as the location line; and upon posts numbered one and two shall be written the name given to the lode mineral claim, the name of the locator, and the date of the location. Upon post numbered one there shall be written, in addition to the foregoing ""Initial post,"" the approximate compass bearing of post number two, and statement of the number of meters lying to the right and to the left of the line from post number one to post number two, thus: ""Initial post. Direction of post number two ___________ meters of this claim lie on the right and ___________ meters on the left of the line from number one post to number two post.""
Section 41. When a claim has been located the locator shall immediately mark the line between posts number one and two so that it can be distinctly seen. The locator shall also place a post at the point where he has found minerals in place, or on the surface vertically above such point if the discovery be underground, on which shall be written ""Discovery post"": Provided, That when the claim is surveyed the surveyor shall be guided by the records of the claim, the sketch plan in the declaration of location made by the locator when the claim was located and recorded, posts number one and two, and the notice on number one, the initial post. In cases where, from the nature or shape of the ground, it is impossible to mark the location line of the claim as provided in this Act, then the claim may be marked by placing posts as nearly as possible to the proper position of number one and number two posts, and noting thereon the distance and direction of such posts from such positions, which distance and direction shall be set out in the declaration of location of the claim.
Section 42. In addition to the requirements of sections forty and forty-one of this Act with regard to the placing of posts number one and two on the line of location, and to the marking of the line between them, each locator of the lode mineral claim shall blaze trees along the boundary line thereof by clearing or by marking the same with any other readily distinguishable signs or marks, and shall establish each of the four corners of the claim by marking a standing tree or rock in place, or by setting in the ground, when practicable, a post or stone. Each corner shall be distinctly marked with the name of the claim, the name of the locator, and the date of location, and with such words as to indicate that it is the northeast, southwest, or other corner, as the case may be, of the lode mineral claim concerned, and the posts or stones used to mark such corners shall be as follows:
When a post is used, it must be at least fifteen centimeters in diameter or twelve centimeters on each side by one hundred forty centimeters in length, and where practicable, set forty centimeters in the ground and surrounded by a mound of earth or stone, one hundred twenty-five centimeters in diameter by sixty-five centimeters in height; when a stone, not a rock in place is used, it must not be less than thirty-five centimeters on each side by eighty centimeters in length, and must be set so as to project half its length above the ground; when a stone or rock in place is used, a cross must be cut in the stone, the arms of which cross must be at least twelve centimeters long, intersecting approximately at right angles and in their centers, the cutting to be at least two centimeters deep. The intersection of the arms shall constitute the corner.
Section 43. It shall not be lawful to move number one post of a lode mineral claim but number two post may be moved by the mineral land surveyor when the distance between posts numbered one and two exceeds three hundred meters in order to place number two post three hundred meters from number one post on the line of location. When the distance between posts numbered one and two is less than three hundred meters, the mineral land surveyor shall have no authority to extend the claim beyond post numbered two. Section44. The location line shall govern the direction of one side of the claim, upon which the survey shall be extended according to the provisions of this Act.
Section 45. Placer mining claims may be of an irregular pattern following the meanderings of a creek, river, or stream; Provided, That on placer grounds not confined to the beds of such creeks, rivers, or streams, or on those extending beyond the banks thereof, placer claims shall be located in as nearly as possible rectangular form.
Section 46. The locator of a placer claim shall post upon the same a notice containing the name of the claim, designating it as a placer claim, the name of each locator, the date of location, the number of the corners of the claim, and the number of hectares claimed. He shall also define the boundaries of the claim by marking a standing tree, or rock in place, or by setting a post, stone, or monument at each corner or angle of the claim. The trees, rocks in place, stakes, stones, or monuments used to mark the corners or angles of a placer mining claim must be inscribed with a series of consecutive numbers, thus Corner No. 1, Corner No. 2, Corner No. 3, and so forth, in clockwise direction, and at least the four end corners of the placer mining claim shall be marked with the name of the claim, the name of the locator, and the date of location. The posts, stones, or monuments used to mark the corners of a placer mining claim must be of the dimensions required by section forty-two of this Act for the posts, stones, or monuments to be used in marking the corners or angles of a lode mineral claim.
Section 47. The record of a lode or placer claim shall consist of a declaration of location which shall contain, among others, the name of the claim, the name of each locator, the date of location, the names of the sitio, barrio, municipality, province and island, in which the claim is situated, the words written on the number one and number two posts in the case of lode claims, and a true copy of the notice posted on the placer claim and shall recite all the facts necessary to the identification of the lode or placer claim, as well as a description of the claim as staked and monumented, showing the length and approximate compass bearing, as near as may be, of each side or course thereof, and stating in what manner the respective corners are marked, whether by standing tree, rock in place, post, or stone, and giving in detail the distinguishing marks that are written or cut on each, and also stating as accurately as possible, preferably by bearing and distance, the position of the claim with reference to some prominent natural objects or permanent monuments.
Section 48. No lode or placer mining claim shall be recorded unless the declaration of location be accompanied by an affidavit made by the applicant or some person on his behalf cognizant of the facts that the legal notices required by this Act for a lode or a placer claim have been posted upon the claim, that in the case of a lode claim mineral has been found in place therein, or in the case of a placer claim the ground thereby embraced is valuable for placer mining purposes, and that the ground applied for is unoccupied for mining purposes by any other person.
Section 49. No lode or placer mining claim shall be recorded unless the declaration of location be accompanied by proof that the locator, or each of them, in case there be more than one, is a citizen of the Philippines, of legal age, or is an association, or a corporation organized and constituted under the laws of the Philippines, at least sixty per centum of the capital of which association or corporation is owned and held by citizens of the Philippines.
Section 50. Proof of citizenship and of age under the clauses of this Act relating to location and lease of mineral lands may consist, in the case of an individual, of his own affidavit; in the case of an association of persons unincorporated, of the affidavit of their authorized agent made on his own knowledge; and in the case of a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines, by the filing of a certified copy of its charter or certificate of incorporation, accompanied by the affidavit of any duly authorized representative of the corporation cognizant of the facts, certifying that at least sixty per centum of its capital is owned and held by citizens of the Philippines.

Section 71. The statements made in the application or made later in support thereof, shall be considered as conditions and essential parts of the lease that may be granted by virtue of such application, and any falsehood in those statements or omission of facts which may alter, change or affect substantially the facts set forth in said statements shall cause the cancellation of the lease granted.
Section 72. Upon receipt of the application, and provided that the requirements of this Act have been substantially complied with, the Director of the Bureau of Mines shall publish a notice that such application has been made, once a week for a period of three consecutive weeks, in the Official Gazette and in two newspapers, one published in Manila either in English or Spanish, and the other published in the municipality or province in which the mining claim is located, if there is such newspaper, otherwise, in the newspaper published in the nearest municipality or province. The first publication of such notice shall be made within thirty days after the filing of the application for lease, if such application is accompanied by an official plan and technical description of the claim or claims covered by the application, and thirty days after the filing of the official plan and technical description of the claim or claims covered by the application, if such application was filed in advance of the filing of such plan and technical description. The Director of the Bureau of Mines shall also cause to be posted on the bulletin board of the Bureau of Mines the same notice for the same period. The applicant shall post for the same period a copy of the plat of the claim or claims applied for, together with a notice of such application for lease, in a conspicuous place on the land embraced in such plat, on the bulletin board, if any, of the municipal building of the municipality, and also in the office of the mining recorder or district mining officer of the province or district in which the claim or claims are located and shall file with the Director of the Bureau of Mines the affidavit of at least two persons stating that such notice has been duly posted in the places above specified. At the expiration of the period of publication the applicant shall file with the Director of the Bureau of Mines an affidavit showing that the plat and notice have been posted in a conspicuous place on the claim or claims concerned and in the places above specified during such period of publication, and thereupon, if no adverse claim shall have been presented to the Director of the Bureau of Mines, it shall be conclusively presumed that no adverse claim exists and thereafter no objection from third parties to the granting of the lease shall be heard; and the lease shall within forty-five days be granted to the applicant, or to his successor or assigns, by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, provided that all amounts then due to the Government of the Philippines, or any of its branches or subdivisions, under the provisions of this Act, shall have been paid. Section73. At any time during the period of publication, any adverse claim may be filed under oath with the Director of the Bureau of Mines, and shall state in full detail the nature, boundaries, and extent of the adverse claim, and shall be accompanied by all plans, documents, and agreements upon which such adverse claim is based. Upon the filing of any adverse claim all proceedings except the publication of notice of application for lease and the making and filing of the affidavits in connection therewith, as herein prescribed, shall be stayed until the controversy shall have been settled or decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, or the adverse claim waived. It shall be the duty of the adverse claimant, within forty-five days after filing his claim, to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to determine the controversy and to prosecute the same with reasonable diligence to final judgment, and a failure to do so shall be considered as a waiver of his adverse claim. After such judgment shall been rendered, the party whose right to a lease on the mining claim in controversy, or any portion thereof, shall have been established thereby, may, without giving further notice, file a certified copy of the judgment with the Director of the Bureau of Mines, and the description required in such cases, together with the proper fees, whereupon a lease may forthwith be granted thereon on such mining claim or on such portion thereof as the applicant may be entitled to under the decision of the court. If the decision of the court is that several parties are entitled to leases upon separate and different portions of the mining claim, the subject matter of the application, and such parties have theretofore applied therefor, leases may forthwith be issued to the said several parties according to their respective rights as determined by the decision. If in any action brought pursuant to this section a right to a lease upon any of the claim in controversy shall not be established by any of the parties, the courts shall so find and judgment shall be entered accordingly. In such case the clerk of the court rendering judgment shall file a certified copy of the judgment with the Director of the Bureau of Mines, whereupon the proceedings under the lease application shall be dismissed and the application denied.
Section 74. Leases under the provisions of this Act shall be for a period not exceeding twenty-five years from the date of the execution of the lease contract, and shall be renewable under such terms and conditions as may be provided by law for another period not exceeding twenty-five years. The total period of any lease and the extension thereof shall not exceed fifty years. Such leases shall provide that the lessee may at any time during the life of the lease apply for the cancellation of the same, and surrender the property leased whenever, because of force majeure, or for other causes, it is impossible to continue profitable mining operations thereon. No such lease or renewal thereof shall be assigned or sublet without the prior consent of the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce which shall be granted if the assignment or sublease is to such persons, associations, or corporations as have the qualifications required of locators, holders, or lessees under the provisions of this Act.
Section 75. Leases may be granted covering mining claims located on private lands: Provided, That any exploration, occupation, use or lease of any private land pursuant to this Act shall be subject to the payment of compensation to the owner thereof as provided in this Act.
Section 76. Subject to the provisions of Article XII of the Constitution, the maximum area that may be leased to a person, association, or corporation under the provisions of this Act in any one province shall be as follows:

(a) For lands of the first group containing metals or metalliferous ores: not more than four hundred fifty hectares containing minerals in vein or lode deposits for any individual, association, partnership, sociedad anonima or corporation, nor more than four hundred hectares containing minerals in placer deposits for any individual, nor more than three thousand two hundred hectares containing minerals in placer deposits for any corporation, association, sociedad anonima or limited partnership: Provided, however, That in no case shall the total number of lode mineral claims that a lessee may lease, exceed two hundred fifty in the entire Philippines.

Section 78. Every lease granted under this Act shall be construed as granting to the lessee, his successors or assigns, the right to extract all mineral deposits of the group for which the lease or leases had been granted within the boundary lines of the claim or claims covered by the lease, continued vertically downward; to remove and utilize the same for his own benefit, and to use the lands covered by the lease for the purpose or purposes specified therein: Provided, That in the case of leases covering placer locations the lessee shall not be entitled to extract minerals from any lode or vein deposit found within the boundary of his, its, or their placer claims but the lessee shall have the preferential right to locate and lease such lode deposits. The same privilege shall be granted to lessee for minerals or mineral products belonging to different group or groups found therein upon the condition that the lessee shall first comply with the requirements of the law. Any such location, occupation, use, or lease permitted under this Act shall reserve to the Government the right to grant or use such easements in, over, under, through, or upon lands so entered, located, occupied, leased or used, as may be necessary to the working of the same, or of other mineral lands: Provided, That the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, in granting any lease under this Act may reserve to the Government the right to lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of the surface of the lands embraced within such lease, under existing law or laws, insofar as said surface is not necessary for use by the lessee in extracting and removing the mineral deposits from the land covered by such lease, or in beneficiation of the ores extracted therefrom, or from any other mining claim. The Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, during the life of the lease, is authorized to issue permits for easements herein provided to be reserved, and to permit the use of the lands covered by the lease, or of such other public lands, as may be necessary for the construction and maintenance of mills, mining camps, or other works incident to the mining and milling operations on the lands covered by any lease granted under this Act, or on any other mineral lands.
Section 79. For the privilege of exploring, developing, mining, extracting, and disposing of the minerals from the lands covered by his lease, the lessee shall pay to the Government of the Philippines, through the Collector of Internal Revenue, the rentals, royalties, and taxes provided by law. The rentals shall be due and payable in advance on the date of the granting of the lease, and on the same date every year thereafter during the life of the lease or any renewal thereof; the royalties shall be due and payable within sixty days after the shipment of the mineral or mineral products from the mines; and the tax at the time and in the manner all other real estate taxes are payable under the law. Before the mineral or mineral products are removed from the mines, the Collector of Internal Revenue or his representatives shall first be duly notified thereof. The rentals, royalties, and taxes, shall be as follows:

(a) Rentals. - On all mineral lands of the first, second, fourth, and fifth groups provided for under this Act - one peso per hectare or fraction thereof. Fifty per centum of all the rentals collected shall accrue to the province, and fifty per centum, to the municipality in which the mining claim or claims is or are located: Provided, That in case of chartered cities the full amount shall accrue to the city concerned.
(b) Royalties. - On all minerals extracted from, or mineral products of, mineral lands of the first, second, fourth and fifth groups as provided for in this Act - a royalty of one and one-half per centum of the actual market value of gross output thereof; Provided, That in the case of gold mines, their annual gross output shall be subject to a royalty of one and one-half per centum when the value of the said output does not exceed five hundred thousand pesos; two per centum when the value exceeds five hundred thousand pesos but does not exceed one million pesos; two and one-half per centum when the value exceeds one million pesos but does not exceed one million five hundred thousand pesos; three per centum when the value exceeds one million five hundred thousand pesos but does not exceed two million pesos; three and three-eighths per centum when the value exceeds two million pesos but does not exceed two million five hundred thousand pesos; three and three-fourths per centum when the value exceeds two million five hundred thousand pesos but does not exceed three million pesos; four and one-eighth per centum when the value exceeds three million pesos but does not exceed three million five hundred thousand pesos; four and one-half per centum when the value exceeds three million five hundred thousand pesos but does not exceed four million pesos; four and three-fourths per centum when the value exceeds four million pesos but does not exceed four million five hundred thousand pesos; five per centum when the value exceeds four million five hundred thousand pesos but does not exceed five million pesos; five and one-eighth per centum when the value exceeds five million pesos but does not exceed five million five hundred thousand pesos; five and one-fourth per centum when the value exceeds five million five hundred thousand pesos but does not exceed six million pesos; five and three-eighths per centum when the value exceeds six million pesos but does not exceed six million five hundred thousand pesos; and five and one-half per centum when the value exceeds six million five hundred thousand pesos: Provided, further, That the following rates of deduction from the royalties on the annual gross output of gold payable under the provisions of this section shall be allowed:

(1) Fifteen per centum in the case of lode mines producing gold from ores which average less than ten pesos, but more than seven pesos per ton;
(2) Twenty-five per centum in the case of lode mines producing gold from ores which averages less than seven pesos per ton. The average value per ton of ore shall be determined by the total number of tons milled during that year for any particular lode mine.
(3) Thirty-five per centum in the case of gold placer mines.

The term ""gross output"" of mines or mineral lands shall be interpreted as the actual market value of mineral or mineral products, or of bullion from each mine or mineral lands operating as a separate entity without any deduction for mining, milling, refining, transporting, handling, marketing, or any other expenses. The output of any group of contiguous mining claims shall not be subdivided. All the royalties herein provided to be charged shall accrue to the general fund of the Philippine Treasury, and shall be in lieu of the ad valorem tax on the market value of the output of mines provided to be levied and collected, under section fifteen hundred thirty-four of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by Act Numbered Four thousand fifty-eight.

Fifty per centum of the real estate tax collected as herein provided shall accrue to the province, and fifty per centum of the same shall accrue to the municipality in which the mineral land leased is located: Provided, That in the case of chartered cities the full amount shall accrue to the city concerned.

In contracts of lease granted under this Act, it shall be provided that the rentals, royalties, and taxes, shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of existing law.
Section 80. Failure to pay the annual rentals or royalties required by this Act for a period of ninety days after demand shall cause the lease concerned to lapse and the claim or claims, with respect to which such failure to pay was made, shall thereupon be open to relocation and lease by other persons qualified to locate and lease mining claims under the provisions of this Act in the same manner as if no location of the same had ever been made, unless the lessee, his heirs, executors, administrators, assigns or legal representatives shall have paid all such annual rentals and royalties due and have resumed work on the claim or claims after such failure and before such relocation: Provided, That no person who may be delinquent in the payment of any rental or royalty hereinabove required to be paid on any mining claim or claims held under lease may relocate the same or any portion thereof: Provided, further, That nothing herein contained shall preclude the Government from collecting any rental, royalties, or taxes due.

The period within which the work required to be done annually on all mining claims shall commence on the first day of January succeeding the date of the granting of the lease on the said claim or claims, and shall be completed on or before the thirty-first day of December of the same year: Provided, further, That failure to perform the annual labor or improvements required herein shall constitute abandonment on the part of the holder and the land shall be subject to relocation by other persons.
Section 82. Actual expenditures and cost of mining improvements by the holder of a lease or his grantors, having a direct relation to the development of the claim or group of claims, shall be included in the estimate of assessment work. The expenditures may be made from the surface, or in running a tunnel, drifts, cross-cuts, or trenches for the development of the claim or group of claims. Improvements of any other character, such as buildings, machinery, or roadways, must be excluded from the estimate, unless it is clearly shown that they are associated with actual excavations, such as cuts, tunnels, shafts, and so forth, and are essential to the practical development of, and actually facilitate, the extraction of minerals from the claim, or the leasehold. Labor performed or improvements made, if any, during the period from the date of the recording of the claim to the issuance of the lease thereon, if the locator or holder thereof or their successor in interest should acquire the lease, may be credited for assessment work on the said claim or claims only for the first period or year within which the work is required to be done under the provisions of this Act.
