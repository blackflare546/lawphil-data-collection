Exemption may be granted by the Secretary of Labor only if, after proper inquiry, he becomes convinced that the conditions and exigencies of the business of an employer require less frequent payment of salaries and wages but no employer shall be authorized to make such payment with less frequency than once a month and unless he establishes a store within or near the business premises from which the employees and laborers can conveniently buy foodstuffs and other articles of prime necessity at cost and on credit, payable at the following pay day. ;
Section 2. Nothing in the preceding section shall be construed as authorizing any person, firm or corporation con­ducting any business or enterprise for profit or otherwise in the Philippines, in any manner to force, compel, or oblige any laborer or employee employed by him to pur­chase directly or indirectly merchandise, commodities or any other personal property of any kind or nature from such person, firm or corporation or from any other person, firm or corporation, or to pay or cause to be paid wholly ( or partly the salary or wages of an employee or laborer, before, during or after pay day by means of tokens, tickets, ' chits or objects other than the legal tender currency of the Philippines; or to negotiate directly or indirectly through any other person, firm or corporation with an employee or laborer by means of chits, tickets or other objects which may represent loans or sums of money paid in advance for salary or wages that are not yet due at the time of the issuance of such tokens, chits or tickets.(awÞhi(
Section 3. Any contract, verbal or written, between employer and laborer which directly or indirectly defeats the pur­poses of this Act shall be null and void. '
Section 4. Failure of the employer to pay his employee or laborer as required by section one of this Act, shall prima facie be considered a fraud committed by such employer against his employee or laborer by means of false pretenses similar to those mentioned in article three hundred and fifteen, paragraph four, sub-paragraph two (a) of the Re­vised Penal Code and shall be punished in the same manner as therein provided.
Section 5. Any person who shall violate willfully the provi­sions of section two of this Act shall be punished for each offense by a fine of not more than two thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for a period of not more than two years, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the dis­cretion of the court.
Section 6. For the purposes of sections four and five of this Act, it shall be understood that in the case of a company, firm or corporation, the manager or, in his default, the person acting as such when the violation took place shall be the person responsible.
