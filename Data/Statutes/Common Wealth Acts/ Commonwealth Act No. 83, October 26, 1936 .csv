c. However, the Commission may by rules or regulations provide that any of the above information or document need not be included in respect of any class of issuer of securities, if it finds that the requirement of such information or document is inapplicable to such class and that disclosure fully adequate for the protection of investors is otherwise included in a registration statement filed in accordance with such rules.

Upon filing of such registration statement, the issuer or dealer shall pay to the Treasury of the Philippines a fee of one-tenth of one per centum of the maximum aggregate price at which such securities are proposed to be offered, but in no case shall such fee be less than fifty pesos or more than one thousand pesos; and the fact of such filing shall be immediately published by the Commission, at the expense of the issuer or dealer, in two newspapers of general circulation in the Philippines, one published in English and another, in Spanish, once a week for two consecutive weeks, reciting that a registration statement for the sale of such security has been filed with it, and that the aforesaid registration statement, as well as the papers attached thereto, are open to inspection during business hours, by interested parties, under such regulations as the Commission may prescribe; and copies thereof, photostatic or otherwise, shall be furnished to every applicant at such reasonable charge as the Commission may prescribe.
The filing of such statement in the office of the Commission, the payment of the fee hereinabove prescribed, and the publication made as above stated, shall constitute the registration of such security, and seven days after the expiration of the period for publication above referred to, the registration shall take effect, and the security, if not a speculative security, may be sold in the Philippines, subject, however, to the further orders of the Commission as hereinafter provided. The Commission shall, upon the filing of the registration statement above referred to, determine, by order, whether or not the security sought to be registered is speculative within the meaning of this Act, and shall forthwith advise the issuer or dealer.
Section 8. Suspension of registration.-If, at any time, in the opinion of the Commission, the information contained in the statement filed is or has become misleading, incorrect, inadequate or incomplete, or the sale or offering for sale of the security may work or tend to work a fraud, the Commission may require from the person filing such statement such further information as may in its judgment be necessary to enable the Commission to ascertain whether the registration of such security should be revoked on any ground specified in section twelve, and the Commission may also suspend the right to sell such security pending further investigation, by entering an order specifying the grounds for such action, and by notifying by mail, or personally, or by telephone confirmed in writing, or by telegraph, the person filing such statement and every dealer who shall have notified the Commission of an intention to sell such security. The refusal to furnish information required by the Commission within a reasonable time to be fixed by the Commission, may be a proper ground for the entry of such order of suspension. Upon the entry of any such order of suspension, no further sales of such security shall be made until the further order of the Commission.
In the event of the entry of such order of suspension, the Commission shall give a prompt hearing to the parties interested. If upon such hearing, the Commission shall determine that the sale of any such security should be revoked on any ground specified in section twelve, it shall enter a final order prohibiting sales of such security, with its findings with respect thereto. Until the entry of such final order, the suspension of the right to sell, though binding upon the persons notified thereof, shall be deemed confidential, and shall not be published, unless it shall appear that the order of suspension has been violated after notice.
Appeals from such final order may be taken to the President of the Philippines, within the period of thirty days from the date of notification of such order. If, however, upon such hearing, the Commission shall find that the sale of the security will neither be fraudulent nor result in fraud, it shall forthwith enter an order revoking such order of suspension, and such security shall be restored to its status as a security registered under this Act, as of the date of such order of suspension.
Section 9. License to sell speculative securities.-With respect to speculative securities, if the Commission shall find after an examination of the registration statement filed by the issuer or dealer, together with all the other papers and documents attached thereto, that the issuer is of good repute, and that the sale of the security would not be fraudulent and would not work or tend, to work a fraud upon the purchaser, and that the enterprise or business of the issuer is not based upon unsound business principles, it shall record the registration of such security in the Register of Securities, and, after the effective date of such registration as above stated, it shall issue to the issuer or dealer a license to sell those securities in the Philippines, and shall issue to such issuer a certificate of permit reciting that such person, its brokers or agents, are entitled to offer the securities named in said certificate for sale in the Philippines. Every permit shall recite in bold type that the issuance thereof is permissive only and does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement of the securities permitted to be issued.
With respect to speculative securities, the Commission shall, by order duly recorded, fix the amount of commission or other form of remuneration to be paid in cash or otherwise, directly or indirectly, for or in connection with the sale or offering for sale of such securities in the Philippines in no case to exceed ten per centum of the value of the securities sold; and shall fix the maximum amount of compensation which the issuer shall pay for mining claims and/or mineral rights for which provision is made by the issuer for payment in cash or securities. It may issue the permit subject to other conditions, to the end that this power may become effective. The amount of compensation which shall be paid the owner and/or holder of such mining claims and/or mineral rights shall be a fair valuation thereof, as may be fixed by the Commission, after consultation with the Bureau of Mines, and after receiving such technical information as the issuer or dealer and/or the owner or owners of such claims may care to submit in the premises.
Section 10. Consent to service.-Upon any application for dealer, registration, whether made by an issuer or registered dealer, where the issuer is not domiciled in the Philippines, there shall be filed with such application the irrevocable written consent of the issuer that in suits, proceedings and actions growing out of the violation of any provision of this Act, the service on the Commission of any notice, process, or pleading therein, authorized by the laws of the Philippines, shall be as valid and binding as if due service had been made on the issuer. Any such action shall be brought either in the province of the plaintiff's residence or in the City of Manila. Said written consent shall be authenticated by the seal of issuer, if it has a seal, and by the acknowledged signature of a member of the copartnership or company, or by the acknowledged signature of any officer of the incorporated or unincorporated association, if it be an incorporated or unincorporated association, duly authorized by resolution of the board of directors, trustees or managers of the corporation or association, and shall in such case be accompanied by a duly certified copy of the resolution of the board of directors, trustees or managers of the corporation or association, authorizing the officers to execute the same. In case any process or pleadings mentioned in this Act are served upon the Commission, it shall be duplicate copies, one of which shall be filed in the office of the Commission and another immediately forwarded by the Commission by registered mail to the principal office of the issuer against which said process or pleadings are directed.

Such person shall also file with the Commission, before or at the time of their issuance for publication, copies of all circulars, prospectuses and other advertising matter to be issued from time to time by or on behalf of such person.
Section 12. Revocation of registration of securities and of license to sell.-The Commission may revoke the registration of any security and the license to sell a speculative security by entering an order to this effect, with its findings in respect thereto, if upon examination into the affairs of the issuer of such security, it shall appear that the issuer:

Section 14. Registration of brokers, dealers, and salesmen.-No broker, dealer, or salesman shall engage in business in the Philippines as such broker, dealer or salesman or sell any securities, including securities exempted in section five of this Act, except in transactions exempt under section six of this Act, unless he has been registered as a broker, dealer or salesman in the office of the Commission pursuant to the provisions of this section.
An application for registration in writing shall be filed in the office of the Commission in such form as the Commission may prescribe, duly verified by oath, which shall state the principal office of the applicant, wherever situated, and the location of its principal office and all branch offices in the Philippines, if any; the name or style of doing business, the names, residence and business addresses of all persons interested in the business as principals, copartners, officers and directors, specifying as to each his capacity and title; the general plan and character of business and the length of time the dealer has been engaged in business. The Commission may also require such additional information as to applicant's previous history, record and association, as it may deem necessary to establish the good repute in business of the applicant.
There shall be filed with such application an irrevocable written consent to the service of process upon the Commission in actions against such broker or dealer in manner and form as hereinabove provided in section ten.
If the Commission shall find that the applicant is of good repute and has complied with the provisions of this section, including the payment of the fee hereinafter provided, he shall register such applicant as a broker or dealer upon his filing a bond or other security in lieu thereof, in such sum as may be fixed by the Commission based upon its judgment as to the amount required for the due protection of the public, running to the Government of the Philippines, and conditioned upon the faithful compliance with the provisions of this Act by said broker or dealer and by all salesmen registered by the latter while acting for him. Such bond shall be executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the Philippines. In lieu of such bond, he may file bonds of the Government of the Philippines or of the United States, or other security acceptable to the Commission. If a bond is filed, any person damaged by the failure of such broker or dealer or of any salesman registered by the latter while acting for him, to comply with the provisions of this Act, shall be entitled to sue the sureties under such bond and to recover the damages so suffered thereunder. If other securities are filed in lieu thereof, such person may subject such securities to the payment of such damage.
Upon the written application of a registered dealer or broker and general satisfactory showing as to good character and the payment of the fee prescribed in this Act, the Commission shall register as salesmen of such dealer or broker such natural persons as the dealer or broker may request. Such registration shall cease upon the termination of the employment of such salesmen by such dealer or broker.
The names and addresses of all persons approved for registration as brokers, dealers or salesmen and all orders with respect thereto shall be recorded in a Register of Brokers, Dealers and Salesmen kept in the office of the Commission which shall be open to public inspection. Every registration under this section shall expire on the thirty-first day of December in each year, but new registration for the succeeding year shall be issued upon written application and upon payment of the fee as hereinafter provided, without filing of further statements or furnishing any further information unless specifically required by the Commission. Application for renewals must be made not less than thirty nor more than sixty days before the first day of the ensuing year, otherwise they shall be treated as original applications. The fee for such registration and for each annual renewal shall be fifty pesos in the case of brokers, fifty pesos in the case of dealers and ten pesos in the case of salesmen.
Changes in registration occasioned by changes in the personnel of a partnership or in the principals, copartners, officers or directors of any broker or dealer may be made from time to time by written application setting forth the facts with respect to such change.
Every registered broker or dealer who intends to offer any security for sale shall notify the Commission in writing of his intention so to do. The notice shall contain the name of the broker or dealer and shall state the name of the security to be offered for sale, and whenever a broker or dealer shall have prepared such notice and shall have forwarded the same by registered mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the Commission, such dealer or broker, as to the contents of such notice and the filing thereof, shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this paragraph. Any issuer of a security required to be registered under the provisions of this Act, selling such securities except in exempt transactions as defined in section six hereof, shall be deemed a dealer within the meaning of this section and required to comply with all the provisions hereof.
Section 15. Revocation of brokers'', dealers' and salesmen's registration.-Registration under section fourteen may be refused or any registration granted may be revoked by the Commission if, after a reasonable notice and a hearing, the Commission determines that such applicant or registrant so registered:

1. Has violated any provision of this Act or any regulation made hereunder; or
2. Has made a material false statement in the application for registration; or
3. Has been guilty of a fraudulent act in connection with any sale of securities, or has been or is engaged or is about to engage in making fictitious or pretended sales or purchases of any of such securities or has been or is engaged or is about to engage in any practice or sale of securities which is fraudulent or in violation of the law; or
4. Has demonstrated his unworthiness to transact the business of broker, dealer or salesman.

In cases of charges against a salesman, notice thereof shall also be given the broker or dealer employing such salesman.
Pending the hearing, the Commission shall have the power to order the suspension of such broker's, dealer's or salesman's registration; provided, that such order shall state the cause for such suspension.
Until the entry of a final order, the suspension of such broker's or dealer's registration, though binding upon the persons notified thereof, shall be deemed confidential, and shall not be published, unless it shall appear that the order of suspension has been violated after notice.
In the event the Commission determines to refuse or revoke a registration as hereinabove provided, he shall enter a final order with his findings on the Register of Brokers, Dealers and Salesmen; and suspension or revocation of the registration of a dealer or broker shall also suspend or revoke the registration of all his salesmen.
It shall be sufficient cause for refusal or cancellation of registration in case of a partnership or corporation or any unincorporated association, if any member of a partnership or any officer or director of the corporation or association has been guilty of any act or omission which would be cause for refusing or revoking the registration of an individual dealer, broker or salesman.

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith served upon the Commission, and thereupon the Commission shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. Upon the filing of such transcript, such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, and enforce or set aside such order, in whole or in part.

The judgment and decree of the court, affirming, modifying, and enforcing or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such order of the Commission, shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States in cases where and upon the grounds by which a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the Philippines may be presented in the Supreme Court of the United States.
