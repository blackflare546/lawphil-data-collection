AN ACT TO APPROPRIATE THE SUM OF ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS FOR THE RELIEF OF COMMUNITIES AND INDIGENT SUFFERERS FROM TYPHOONS, FLOODS, OR OTHER PUBLIC CALAMITIES.
Whereas, in the month of October, nineteen hundred and thirty-six, strong typhoons lashed the Philippines, particularly the provinces of Central and Northern Luzon;
Whereas, said public calamity has wrought tremendous losses to life and property, the cataclysm having been made worse by the floods which followed, wiping away communities and completely destroying permanent public works;
Whereas, investigation made by the President himself, has revealed that the situation demands immediate action in order to avoid further grave consequences in the form of famine, epidemics, and desolation;
Whereas, in view of the difficulty to itemize expenses it is more expedient to authorize the President of the Philippines to expend the sum appropriated herein: Now, therefore
Be it enacted by the National Assembly of the Philippines:
Section 1. The sum of one million five hundred thousand pesos or so much thereof as may be necessary is hereby appropriated out of any funds in the Philippine Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the relief and rehabilitation of communities and/or indigent sufferers from typhoons, floods, or other public calamities, to be expended in the discretion of the President of the Philippines in such manners as he may deem proper and through such official, office, entity or agency as he may designate.ℒαwρhi৷
Section 2. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
Approved, October 26, 1936.
