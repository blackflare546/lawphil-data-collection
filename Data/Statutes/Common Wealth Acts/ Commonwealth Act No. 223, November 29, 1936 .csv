With reference to the airmail to foreign countries the pay shall be in accordance with the provisions of Act Numbered Three thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine.
Section 2. The Secretary of Public Works and Communications is hereby authorized to grant to the parties to whom the contracts for the transportation of the mails by air above mentioned are awarded, the right, to use any and all navigation facilities, including landing fields, now or hereafter opened, operated, or controlled by the Government of the Philippines or any subdivision thereof.
