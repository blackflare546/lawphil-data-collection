""(5) To detain freight, goods, or luggage, to answer for the freight, storage and other transportation charges, and in case of failure of the shipper, owner or consignee, to pay for such charges within ten days following the arrival of such, shipment at the point of destination, to sell said freight, goods, or luggage at public auction five days after notification upon the shipper, owner or consignee, by mailing the notice to his postal address as given in the bill of lading and after posting the notice of sale within a like period of five days in the bulletin boards of the stations of origin and destination and of the police stations of the respective municipalities.ℒαwρhi৷ In ease of freight of perishable nature, the president of the railroad corporation may order their sale within a shorter period of time after the announcement of the sale and upon notifying the shipper, owner, or consignee by telegram or letter, if possible. Articles left unclaimed in trains or stations for a period of ten days, or for a shorter time, if they are of perishable nature, may be disposed of in the same manner; and if the articles fail to show the postal address of their owner, the posting of the notice of sale in the bulletin board of the railroad station or wherein they had been found and in the police station of the corresponding municipality will be sufficient. The proceeds of sale shall be applied, first, to the payment of the expenses of said sales, and, second, to the payment of the charges due for transportation and storage, and the balance, if any there be, shall be deposited to the credit of the general funds of the Philippine Treasury, subject within one year from the date of sale, to claims of persons who prove to be entitled to said freight, goods, or luggage.""
Section 2. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
