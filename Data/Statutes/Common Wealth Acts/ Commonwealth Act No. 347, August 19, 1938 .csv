The expenses in making this classification shall be charged against the funds appropriated in this Act.
Section 3. The lands so classified, shall be surveyed and subdivided and shall thereafter be open for disposition in accordance with the terms, limitations, and conditions imposed by the Public Land Act to persons qualified to acquire public lands, but at least one-half of such lands shall be disposed of only by means of homestead entry. The costs of the survey and subdivision and other incidental expenses, including rental or construction of buildings for offices and for housing of the personnel, shall be apportioned, assessed, and collected from all applicants, except those for homestead, in addition to the installments, rentals, or other payments collectible under the provisions of said Act, and shall be paid by the respective applicants in ten equal annual installments without interest from the date of approval of their respective applications.

In order to expedite the survey and subdivision work, the services of duly qualified private land surveyors may be employed, in which case the Director of Lands should impose the conditions that no surveyor should be given an area of more than five thousand hectares, or an association or group of surveyors, ten thousand hectares.

The Government may retain such part of any payment due the surveyor or, surveyors undertaking the work, as may be sufficient to defray the cost of any correction work that may have to be done by the Bureau of Lands.(aw√ûhi(
