Section 2. Section eight of the same Act Numbered Thirty-four hundred and twenty-eight, as amended by Act Numbered Thirty-eight hundred and twelve, is further amended to read as follows:
""Section 8. Death benefit.-If the disease contracted or injury received by the employee as provided in section two hereof causes his death within one year from the date of such injury or sickness, the employer shall pay the compensation to the persons entitled thereto, and in case there should be none, he shall pay to the person representing the deceased employee the burial expenses not to exceed one hundred pesos, and shall also pay to or for the following persons, in the order of priority and during the periods hereinafter set forth, a weekly compensation equivalent to the following percentages of the average weekly wages of the employee, as determined in section nineteen of thi3 Act:


a. To the dependent widow or widower, in case there are no dependent children, forty-five per centum.
b. To the dependent widow or widower in ease there are one or two dependent children, fifty per centum, and if there are three or more dependent children, sixty per centum. The compensation to the widow or widower shall be for the use or benefit of the widow or widower and of the dependent children, and the Bureau of Labor may from time to time adjust the compensation between them in the most suitable manner possible.
c. If there is no dependent widow or widower, but a dependent child or children, such child or children shall be paid thirty per centum, with ten per centum additional for each child in excess of two, up to a maximum of fifty per centum, which shall be distributed in equal shares among the children if there be more than one.
d. If there are no dependent widow, widower, or children, but there is a dependent father or mother, forty per centum to the father or mother if totally dependent, or twenty-five per centum if partly dependent, and if both parents are dependent, each shall be paid one-half of such compensation. If there is no parent, but dependent grandparents, the same compensation shall be paid as to a father or mother.
e. If there are no dependent widow, widower, child, parent, or grandparent, but there is a dependent grandchild, brother or sister or two or more such, then twenty-five per centum shall be paid for one dependent and five per centum additional for each additional dependent, up to a maximum of forty per centum, which shall be distributed share and share alike among the dependents if there be more than one.


""When several persons are entitled to compensation and there is disagreement concerning the share of the compensation each should receive, the Bureau of Labor shall act as referee and designate the share to be allotted to each dependent, but if the good offices of said Bureau do not meet with the approval of all parties concerned, the courts shall be competent to settle the matter in case an action is brought, and the employer may turn the money over to the court, subject to disposal by the same. In case the laborer or employee who had the accident dies and there is no surviving spouse and the dependents or some of them are minors and have no guardian appointed by a court, the employee? or concern compelled to pay compensation under this Act shall deposit the money represented by such compensation with the local municipal court or justice of the peace court, and the officers thereof shall order payment to the minors through the municipal treasurer and the city treasurer, as the case may be, without necessity of appointing a guardian.""

""In case the employer cannot furnish medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies promptly, the injured employee may acquire the same at the expense of the employer.ℒαwρhi৷
""If, in case of litigation, it is shown before a competent court that the injured employee voluntarily refused to accept the services of a competent physician or surgeon or voluntarily rejected the medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies provided by the employer, or voluntarily obstructed the physician or surgeon or the medical, surgical, or hospital services, such refusal on the part of the employee shall be construed as a waiver of all or part of his rights to the medical, surgical, and hospital services paid for by the employer, and in this ease the employer shall be liable only for the injury or for the disability of any nature that would have ensued if the injured man had accepted the medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies tendered by the employer: Provided, however.

Section 4. Section fourteen of the same Act is hereby amended to read as follows:
""Section 14. Total disability.-In case the injury or sickness causes total disability for labor, the employer, during such disability, but exclusive of the first seven days, shall pay to the injured employee a weekly compensation equivalent to sixty per centum of his average weekly wages; but not more than eighteen pesos nor less than four pesos per week, except in the ease provided for in the next following paragraph. Such weekly payments shall in no case continue after the disability has ceased, nor shall they extend over more than two hundred and eight weeks, nor shall the aggregate sum paid as compensation exceed in any case three thousand pesos. But no award of permanent disability shall take effect until after two weeks have elapsed from the date of the injury.
In the case of an employee whose average weekly wages are less than four pesos per week, the weekly compensation shall be the entire amount of such average weekly wages; but if the disability is permanent, the compensation shall be four pesos in such eases. In the event that the total disability begins after a period of partial disability, the latter shall be deducted from said total period of two hundred and eight weeks.""

In case a laborer refuses to submit to, or does in any manner obstruct the examination mentioned, his right to proceed under this Act shall be suspended until such refusal or obstruction shall cease, and no compensation shall be payable for the entire time of such obstruction.""
Section 7. Section twenty-four of the same Act is hereby amended to read as follows:

In case medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies have been furnished voluntarily by the employer, notice of the injury or sickness within the time limit above mentioned shall not be necessary, and if the employer has voluntarily made the compensation payments, the claim for compensation to be made within the time limits above established shall no longer be necessary.""

""Section 25. Form of notice and claim.-The notice and claim shall be in writing and the notice shall contain the name and address of the employee and shall establish in plain and clear language the time, place, nature, and cause of the injury or sickness and shall be signed by the employee or any older person in his behalf, or in case of his death, by a person or persons dependent upon him, or by any other person in their behalf.
