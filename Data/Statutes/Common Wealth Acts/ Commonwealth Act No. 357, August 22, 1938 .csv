Section 140. Excess ballots. - Before proceeding to count the votes the board of inspectors shall count the ballots found in the box for valid ballots without unfolding them or exposing their contents, except so far as to ascertain that each ballot is single and shall compare the number of ballots in the box with the number of voters who have voted. If there are excess ballots, they shall be replaced in the box, shall be thoroughly mingled therein and one of the inspectors designated by the board, without seeing the ballots and with his back to the box, shall publicly draw out as many ballots as may be equal to such excess and without unfolding them place them in a package which shall be marked ""EXCESS BALLOTS"" and which shall be sealed and signed by the members of the board, which package shall be replaced in the box with the other ballots and their contents shall not be read in the counting of votes. If in the course of this examination, any ballots shall be found folded together in such manner that they must have been so folded before they were deposited in the box, they shall be placed in the package for excess ballots hereinbefore mentioned.

Non-official ballots which the board may find, except those which have been used as emergency ballots, shall be counted as marked ballots.
Section 142. Box for spoiled ballots. - The ballots deposited in the red box shall be presumed to be spoiled ballots, whether or not they contain such notation, but if the board of inspectors should find that during the voting any valid ballot has by mistake been placed in the box, or any ballot separated as ""excess"" or ""marked"" has been erroneously placed therein and not in the proper package, the board shall open the red box after the voting and before the counting of votes, and only then, for the only purpose of drawing them out, and shall prepare and sign a statement of such fact and lock the box with its three keys immediately thereafter. The valid ballot so withdrawn shall be mixed with the other valid ballots and the excess and marked ballots which may be found shall be placed in the respective packages for such ballots for which purpose such packages shall be opened and again labeled, sealed, signed and kept as hereinbefore provided.
Section 143. Manner of counting votes. - The counting of votes shall be made in the following manner: The board shall form piles of one hundred ballots each, fully extended, which shall be held together with rubber bands, with cardboards of the size of the ballots to serve as folders. The chairman of the board shall take the ballots of the first pile one by one and read, jointly with the other inspector belonging to the party opposed to his, the names of the persons voted for each office in the order in which they appear thereon, assuming such a position as to enable all, or at least a majority of the watchers, to read such names. The other inspector shall record on the tally sheet, as the names voted for each office are read, the number of votes received by each candidate, each time by means of a vertical line, except every fifth vote of the same candidate which shall be noted with a diagonal line. The poll clerk shall do likewise on the blackboard. After finishing the first pile of ballots, the board shall make partial additions of the votes, which shall be noted on the tally sheet and on the blackboard, and in case of discrepancy such recount as may be necessary shall be made. Thereafter the same procedure shall be followed with the second pile of ballots and so on successively. After all the votes of the precinct have been counted, the board shall ascertain their total sums which shall be likewise recorded on the tally sheet and on the blackboard; it shall pack each group of ballots and place them in an envelope prepared for such purpose, which shall be closed, sealed, signed, and deposited in the box. The tally sheets on which the votes have been recorded and wherein the partial and total sums have been made shall not be changed nor destroyed and shall be kept in the box with the ballots.
Section 144. Rules for the appreciation of ballots. - In the reading and appreciation of ballots the following rules shall be observed:

1. Any ballot where only the Christian name of a candidate or only his surname appears is valid for such candidate, if there is no other candidate with the same name or surname for the same office; but when the word written in the ballot is at the same time the Christian name of a candidate and the surname of his opponent, the vote shall be counted in favor of the latter.
2. A name or surname incorrectly written which, when read, has a sound equal or similar to that of the name or real surname of the candidate shall be counted in his favor.
3. When the name of a candidate appears in two spaces of the ballot, it shall be counted in favor of the candidate for the office with respect to which he has filed certificate of candidacy. The vote for the office for which he is not a candidate shall be counted as stray.
4. When in a space of the ballot there appears a name that is erased and another clearly written, the ballot is valid for the latter.(awÞhi(
5. Ballots which contain prefixes such as ""Sr."", ""Mr."", ""Don"", ""Guinoo"", ""Hon."", ""Dr."", ""Gob."", or suffixes like ""hijo"", ""Jr."", ""Segundo"", are valid.
6. The erroneous initial of the name which accompanies the correct surname of a candidate, the erroneous initial of the surname accompanying the correct name of a candidate, and the erroneous intermediate initial between the correct name and surname of a candidate does not annul the vote in favor of the latter.
7. The fact that there exists a person who is not a candidate with the name or surname of a candidate does not prevent the adjudication of the vote to the latter.
8. Ballots wholly written in Arabic in localities where it is of general use are valid. To read them the board may employ any person who upon oath can do so impartially.
9. The use of nicknames and appellations of affection and friendship, if accompanied by the name or surname of the candidate, does not annul the vote in favor of the latter, except upon conclusive proof that they were used as a means to identify their respective voters.
10. Any ballot written with lead pencil or with ink, wholly or in part, is valid.
11. Where there are two or more candidates voted for an office for which the law authorizes the election of only one person the ballot shall not be counted in favor of any of them, but this shall not affect the validity of the other votes contained therein.
12. The excess of candidates voted for councilor or for offices for which the election of two or more candidates is required does not annul the ballot, but for such offices the ballot shall be counted only in favor of the candidates firstly voted for therein until the authorized number is covered.
13. Any vote in favor of a person who has not filed a certificate of candidacy, or in favor of a candidate for an office for which he did not present himself, shall be invalid and counted as stray vote, but this shall not invalidate the whole ballot.

15. Any ballot containing initials only or which is illegible or which does not sufficiently identify the candidate for whom it is intended shall not be valid, but this shall not invalidate the whole ballot.

17. Circles, crosses or lines put on the spaces on which the voter has not voted shall be considered as signs to indicate his desistance from voting and shall not invalidate the ballot.
18. Unless it should clearly appear that they have been deliberately put by the voter to serve as identification marks, commas, dots, lines, or hyphens between the name and surname of a candidate, or in another part of the ballot, traces of the letters ""t,"" ""j"" and other similar ones, the first letters or syllables of names which the voter does not continue, the use of two or more kinds of writing, and unintentional or accidental flourishes, strokes, or strains, shall be considered innocent and shall not invalidate the ballot.
19. The tearing of a ballot accidentally caused does not annul the ballot.
20. Failure to remove the detachable number from the ballot does not annul the latter.
