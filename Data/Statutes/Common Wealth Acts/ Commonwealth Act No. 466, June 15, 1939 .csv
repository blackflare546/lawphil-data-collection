(2) For the purpose of this Chapter, stock in a domestic corporation owned and held by a non-resident not a citizen of the Philippines shall be deemed property within the Philippines, and any property of which the decedent has made a transfer by trust or otherwise, within the meaning of subsection (b) or (c) of section 83 of this Chapter, shall be deemed to be situated in the Philippines if so situated either at the time of the transfer or at the time of the decedent's death.

The estate shall be appraised at its fair market value as of the time of death, or as of six months thereafter, at the election of the executor or administrator in the case of the estate tax or the heirs in the case of inheritance tax. However, for the purpose of determining the value of real property, the assessed value as of the time of death, or, at the election of the executor, administrator or the heirs, as of six months after death, as shown by the tax rolls shall be considered as the fair market value, unless the contrary is shown.
In order to determine the tax which should be paid by the beneficiary of a legacy of education referred to in article 879 of the Civil Code, when the legacy consists of profits, interests, or dividends derived from any property, the legatee should be considered as a usufructuary until he becomes of legal age.
In case a legacy of usufruct is made in favor of a juridical person, the legatee shall pay seventy-five per centum of the tax and the remaining twenty-five per centum shall be paid by the owner of the naked title of the property.
