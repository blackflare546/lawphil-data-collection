AN ACT REMITTING THE BOND OF FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SEVEN PESOS AND NINETY-NINE CENTAVOS FURNISHED BY THE LUZON SURETY COMPANY, INCORPORATED, IN BEHALF OF EUFFENIO UY TUISING IN THE CASES OF PEOPLE VERSUS EUGENIO UY TUISING.
Whereas, the bond of four thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven pesos and ninety-nine centavos, furnished by the Luzon Surety Company, Incorporated, in behalf of the defendant in criminal cases Nos. 13209, 13259 and 14107, all entitled People vs. Eugenio Uy Tuising, in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, has been declared confiscated by reason of the defendant's failure to appear in Court at the time of the reading of the sentences against him;
Whereas, said defendant could not be produced in Court within the period required by the Court's order, dated January 12, 1932, in spite of the diligent efforts employed by the Luzon Surety Company, Incorporated, because said defendant Eugenio Uy Tuising died on January twenty-seven, nineteen hundred and thirty-two, and the fact of his death became known to the Luzon Surety Company, Incorporated, after the Court of First Instance of Cebu, had issued its order confiscating the said bond of four thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven pesos and ninety-nine centavos;
Whereas, the Court's order confiscating the bond furnished by the Luzon Surety Company, Incorporated, in behalf of said defendant, was based merely on a technical reason;
Whereas, circumstances and the interests of justice demand that said bond confiscated by the Court of First Instance of Cebu by reason of defendant's failure to appear in Court, be remitted to the Luzon Surety Company, Incorporated; Now therefore,
Be it enacted by the National Assembly of the Philippines:
Section 1. The bond of four thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven pesos and ninety-nine centavos furnished by the Luzon Surety Company, Incorporated, in favor of the defendant Eugenio Uy Tuising, in the cases of People vs. Eugenio Uy Tuising, which has been declared confiscated by the Court of First Instance of Cebu, is hereby remitted, and that an amount of four thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven pesos and ninety-nine centavos is hereby appropriated, out of any funds in the Philippine Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for this purpose.
Section 2. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
Enacted, without Executive approval, November 30, 1936.
