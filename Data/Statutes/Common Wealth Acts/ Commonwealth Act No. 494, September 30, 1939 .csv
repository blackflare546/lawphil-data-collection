Be it enacted by the National Assembly of the Philippines:
Section 1. A state of war among the nations of the world with which the Philippines has been maintaining commercial and trade relations for many years has produced such serious repercussions in the economy of the nation as to create an emergency. In this situation, it is essential that the Government take stops to prevent a dislocation of the productive forces of the country. In order to avoid unnecessary injury to labor and industry by the inflexible application of the provisions of die Eight-Hour Labor Law, which may ultimately prove detrimental to public interest, the present state of emergency requires that the Government be given authority to suspend the operation of the said law if and when such action becomes necessary.ℒαwρhi৷
