AN ACT VALIDATING THE ACTS PERFORMED BY THE PRESENT COMMERCIAL REGISTER OF THE CITY OF MANILA SINCE THE PASSAGE OF ACT NUMBERED TWELVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Whereas, by section one of Act Numbered Twelve hundred and eighty-eight, registers of deeds, or provincial treasurers performing the duties of register of deeds, were authorized and directed to perform the duties of commercial register, as defined in Title II of the Code of Commerce; and
Whereas, notwithstanding this provision, Enrique Barrera y Caldes, who was then performing the duties of commercial register for the city of Manila, under the advice of his superior officers to the effect that such provision did not affect the commercial register for the city of Manila, continued to perform the duties of such commercial register, and in his absence substitutes were appointed in his place by the Executive Secretary; and
Whereas, in view of the provisions of said section one of Act Numbered Twelve hundred and eighty-eight, doubts have arisen as to whether or not the acts performed by Enrique Barrera y Caldes, and by his substitutes as commercial register, were legal after the taking effect of said Act: Now therefore,
By authority of the  United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Legislature, that:
Section 1. All acts performed by Enrique Barrera y Caldes or by his substitute as commercial register of the city of Manila since the date on which Act Numbered Twelve hundred and eighty-eight took effect are hereby ratified and confirmed, and shall be valid for all purposes as though performed by a duly authorized officer.
Section 2. This Act shall take effect on its passage.
Enacted, January 29, 1913.
