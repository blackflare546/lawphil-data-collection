There is hereby created a temporary Board of Tax Revision, which shall perform the duties and exercise the powers hereinafter described and conferred. The Board shall consist of seven members, all of whom shall he either citizens of the United States or citizens of the Philippine islands and residents of the city of Manila.

In determining the value of the property, the Board of Tax Revision shall give, full consideration to the amount of income which the land and improvements actually produce, and to the income which with reasonable improvements the land might produce; but in the end the property shall he taxed at its true value in money, to wit. the value at which it would be sold in market if there is a market, and if there is not a market value then at a reasonable value thereof. The Board of Tax Revision shall not determine the value of the land, however, by the estimate of the probable income which might be realized from it after the further investment, of capital, when such further investment is out of proportion to the value of the land or involves a risk of loss which land owners can not be expected to assume.

All assessments shall be made in money of the United States.

All refunds made hereunder shall be charged to the city of Manila and the Insular Government shall not be charged with any part of the same.
