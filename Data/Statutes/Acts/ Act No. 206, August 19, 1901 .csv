Section 2. The compensation to be paid provincial officers of the Province of Abra shall be at the following rate per year, money of the United States:

For the provincial governor, one thousand dollars;
For the provincial secretary, nine hundred dollars;
For the provincial treasurer, one thousand two hundred dollars;
For the provincial supervisor, nine hundred dollars;
For the provincial fiscal, nine hundred dollars.

The salary of provincial officers shall be payable monthly so that one-twelfth of the annual salary shall be paid on the last day of each calendar month.
Each provincial officer shall be allowed his necessary and actual traveling expenses, not exceeding two dollars per day, while absent from the capital of the province on official business. The allowance shall be made by the provincial board upon the certificate of the officer that the travel was necessary for the public business, and shall not be paid until the account, accompanied by the resolution of the board approving the same, shall be forwarded to the Insular Treasurer and by him approved.
Section 3. The bond of the provincial treasurer shall be five thousand dollars, until the first day of March, nineteen hundred and two, when, in view of the collection of the land tax, the Commission may require a new bond or an additional bond to cover the probable increase of the funds of which the provincial treasurer shall have custody at any one time. The bond to be given shall be conditioned to secure on the part of the provincial treasurer that he shall account for the internal-revenue collections coining into his hands as internal-revenue collector, the taxes collected by him for each municipality, for the province, and for the Central Government.1a—àphi1 The form of the bond shall be prescribed by the Insular Treasurer. If, upon the request of the Commission, the Military Governor shall detail any military officer to fill a provincial office, no bond shall be required of him and no salary shall be paid him.
Section 4. The presidents or alcaldes of the municipalities of the province shall meet on the third Monday in January, April, July, and October to consider improvements needed in the province and for the provincial government, and to make recommendations to the provincial board. The convention shall be called together by the provincial secretary and shall elect a chairman for each quarter's session. The provincial secretary shall act as secretary of the convention, and shall certify its recommendations to the provincial board.
Section 5. Owing to the fact that there is in the Province of Abra no regularly admitted member of the bar of the Supreme Court of the Islands, it shall not be a necessary qualification of the provincial fiscal that he be a member of such bar.
Section 6. The capital of the province shall be, as formerly, at the town of Bangued.
Section 7. This Act shall take effect on its passage, and officers may be appointed and qualify at once, but the government shall not be organized nor shall the provincial officers receive any salary until September first, nineteen hundred and one.
