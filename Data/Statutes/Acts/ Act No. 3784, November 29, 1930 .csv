Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:
Section 1. Subject to the conditions established in this Act and the provisions of Act Numbered Thirty-one hundred and eight and amendments, applicable thereto, there is hereby granted to Dionisio Consengco, Manuel Santos, Donato Calimbas, and Eusebio Cristobal, for a period of fifty years from the approval of this Act, the right, privilege, and authority to construct, maintain, and operate a water supply system for the purpose of distributing water for sale within the limits of the municipality of Orion, Province of Bataan, Philippine Islands. For this purpose, the grantees shall have the right and privilege to drill, maintain, and operate artesian wells on land owned or duly acquired by them for said purpose within the aforesaid limits, to install and maintain on said land hydraulic pumps moved by steam or otherwise, if necessary, and adequate tanks at suitable heights for storing the water from said artesian wells, and to install, lay, and maintain above or below the ground on the right of way duly acquired by said grantees, or below the ground on all the streets, public thoroughfares and public places and along or under the bridges within said limits, water mains, pipes, and conduits, and all other necessary apparatus and appurtenances for the furnishing and distribution of the water contained in said tanks, and to supply, sell, and furnish water to any person, corporation or public or private concern within said limits for provincial, municipal, domestic, or manufacturing uses and for any other use to which water may be put, and to charge and collect a schedule of prices and conventional rates for the use of said water: Provided, That this franchise shall not take effect until the grantees shall have obtained from the Public Service Commission a certificate showing the public necessity and convenience thereof, according to the purpose of subsection (i), section fifteen of Act Numbered Thirty-one hundred and eight, as amended, and shall have filed such certificate with the Secretary of Commerce and Communications, upon accepting this franchise: And provided, further, That if the grantees do not file the proper application for said certificate with the Public Service Commission, within three months from the date of the approval of this Act, this franchise shall become null and void.1a—àphi1
Section 2. All water mains and pipes situated within the strong-material zone of the municipality of Orion, Province of Bataan, as now or hereafter established by law, shall be placed at least forty-five centimeters below the surface of the ground as far as the upper part of such mains or pipes is concerned. The water mains or pipes between the storage tanks and the source of supply and said limits of the strong-material zone of the municipality may be put above the ground on the grantees' right of way except where they cross a street or public place, in which case they shall be placed below the ground at the depth above mentioned. The construction and laying of the mains and pipes shall be done in a workmanlike manner, in accordance with a plan previously approved by the Public Service Commission, and whenever it shall be necessary to change the level in any part thereof in order to avoid interference with any public sewer or drain constructed or to be constructed, the grantees herein shall forthwith change such portion of said mains and pipes as the Public Service Commission may direct in writing, and said grantees shall supply water to any applicant for the same, within fifteen days after the date of his application, in the order of the date of his application up to the limit of the capacity of the system of said grantees, to be determined by the Public Service Commission on the application of said grantees, and should the demand for water at any time increase beyond the capacity of the system of said grantees to supply the same, the capacity of said system shall be increased by said grantees to meet such demand, in accordance with the decision of the Public Service Commission or its lawful successor: Provided, That the distribution system of the water pipes shall be installed, laid, maintained, and operated only on such streets and public places of the municipality as the Public Service Commission may designate: And provided, further, That the grantees in furnishing water to applicants therefor, as stated, shall make all connections with their mains and shall be entitled to demand a fair charge therefor as the Public Service Commission may by order provide.
Section 3. All apparatus and appurtenances used by the grantees shall be modern and first class in every respect, and the water mains and pipes shall, as above provided, be placed at a depth of at least forty-five centimeters under the surface of the street, measured from such surface to the upper part of such mains or pipes, and when laid in streets or public places, they shall be so placed and maintained as not to interfere in any manner with the unrestricted use of such public places and streets: Provided, That in the maintenance and operation of their water supply system, the grantees shall always be subject to such reasonable regulations as the Public Service Commission may promulgate in the premises.
Section 4. Whenever it shall be necessary in the laying of said mains or pipes to take up any portion of the sidewalks or dig up the ground of the sidewalks of public streets or thoroughfares, then the said grantees shall, after said mains or pipes are laid, without delay replace said sidewalks in the proper manner or arrange said streets or public thoroughfares, removing from the same all rubbish, dirt, refuse, or other material which may have been placed there, taken up or dug up in the laying of said mains or pipes, leaving them in as good condition as they were before the work was done; and whenever it shall become necessary, by reason of the extension of roads determined upon by the provincial board of Bataan, or by reason of the extension of streets or plazas determined upon by the municipal council of the municipality above mentioned to change the location of said mains or pipes, such change shall be made by the grantees, their successors or assigns, at their expense, without delay, and said mains or pipes shall be placed where directed by said provincial board or said municipal council.
Section 5.

Section 6. The grantees shall have the right to acquire or obtain by grant, lease or purchase sufficient land for the drilling thereon of artesian wells, the placing of hydraulic pumps moved by steam or otherwise, if necessary, and the erection of buildings and of tanks at suitable heights for the storage of the water from said artesian wells, and a right of way separate from all streets and public highways not to exceed ten meters in width, from the location of each tank to the limits of the strong-material zone of the municipality above mentioned, and in order to acquire such land or any part thereof they may institute proceedings in any competent court for the expropriation of all such land or any part thereof, as provided by law.
Section 7. Said grantees shall file their written acceptance of this franchise with the Secretary of Commerce and Communications within one hundred and twenty days from the date when they obtain the certificate required by section one of this Act, and shall commence work under the supervision of the district engineer, in accordance with the plan, specifications, and estimates previously approved by the Public Service Commission, within six months' time from and after the date of filing such acceptance, unless prevented by act of God or force majeure, usurped or military power, martial law, riot, or civil commotion or other inevitable cause, and shall complete the system and have the same in operation within eighteen months from the date of such acceptance, and shall thereafter maintain a first-class water system and furnish first-class service to the public and to private consumers: Provided, That in consideration of the franchise hereby granted, the grantees shall pay quarterly into the municipal treasury of the municipality above named, one per centum of the gross earnings of their business during the first thirty years, and two per centum during the remaining twenty years of the life of this franchise.
