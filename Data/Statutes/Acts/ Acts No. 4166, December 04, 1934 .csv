Section 2. The Government of the United States having, by legislation, undertaken various means to limit, control and allot the quantity of sugar which may be transported to, processed in, or marketed in Continental United States, thereby reducing the amount of Philippine sugar which may be marketed therein, and, the production of sugar in the Philippine Islands having reached such a degree of development that, unless restricted and regulated, a huge surplus of unmarketable sugar will inevitably result, thereby constituting a serious menace to the very existence of the industry, as well as to the happiness and well-being of the inhabitants of these Islands, a state of national emergency is hereby declared to exist and by reason thereof, and in order to meet the said emergency, the present legislation is hereby enacted.
Section 3. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Philippine Legislature, during the time that this Act is in force-

First, to limit the production of sugar cane and sugar in the Philippine Islands to such an amount as would be sufficient to cover the quota allotted to the Philippine Islands under the United States laws and the needs of the local consumption, plus such reserves as may be determined from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
Second, to recognize the United States Sugar Authority in the Philippine Islands for the control and allotment of sugar to be transported to, processed in, and marketed in Continental United States under the laws of the United States seeking to effectuate the same, and to harmonize the laws of the Philippine Islands with those of the United States insofar as they affect production, manufacture and marketing of sugar cane and sugar produced in the Philippine Islands.
Third, to allot among mills and plantation owners the quantity of sugar which may be produced and marketed for direct consumption or held for reserve in the Philippine Islands, and, to make such allocation in such a way as to offset and ameliorate hardships and inequalities that may result from allotments made under the laws of the United States.

Section 4. After this Act takes effect, it shall be unlawful to manufacture centrifugal or ""AA"" refined sugar without first obtaining a license therefor in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
Section 5. The total amount of centrifugal and ""AA"" refined sugar for the manufacture of which licenses may be issued for any crop or calendar year under the terms of this Act, shall be the sum total of the following:

a. The quantity in short tons of ""A"" and ""AA"" which shall be identical with the amount of such sugar, under Act of Congress, may be shipped to Continental United States during the calendar year; plus
b. Such a quantity in short tons of ""B"" sugar Governor-General may from time to time find to be required for consumption within the Philippines Islands, either in its original form or as refined sugar; plus
c. A quantity in short tons of ""C"" sugar equivalent to ten per centum of the total of (a) and (b) or 100,000 short tons, whichever is greater, provided that in determining said amount the Governor-General may, in his discretion, deduct therefrom the whole or any part of the amount of ""C"" sugar in stock at time of determination.

Section 6. The Governor-General, or such other authority as the Government of the United States may so empower, together with such officials and employees of the Government of the United States or the Philippines Islands as such officer may designate, shall constitute the ""United States Sugar Authority in the Philippine Islands,"" and as such, when acting within its legal powers, shall be given full faith and obedience by all persons affected. The allocation of all ""A"" and ""AA"" sugar permitted to be milled within any given calendar or crop year, shall be made by the United States Sugar Authority in the Philippine Islands among the sugar plantation owners, sugar mills and refining plants entitled thereto under the laws and regulations governing the same.
Section 7. The Governor-General is hereby authorized to fix and determine, by executive order or proclamation, the total amount of centrifugal and ""AA"" refined sugar for which manufacturing licenses may be issued hereunder in any given year, as provided in section five hereof, and for this purpose, within thirty days after the approval of this Act, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, he shall, by such executive order or proclamation, fix the total amount of centrifugal and ""AA"" refined sugar that may be lawfully manufactured from the 1934-1935 crop of sugar cane, as well as the total amount of centrifugal and ""AA"" refined sugar which may be manufactured for the 1935-1936 crop. Similar executive orders or proclamations shall be issued from time to time with regard to subsequent crops.
Section 8. The Governor-General shall allocate or cause to be allocated among all the planters engaged in the growing of sugar cane, the total amount of ""B"" and ""C"" sugar the manufacture whereof may be permitted in any given year, as provided in section five of this Act. The allocation of said ""B"" and ""C"" sugar shall be effected in as fair and equitable a manner as may be possible; due regard, however, to be given to such as may deserve reasonable amelioration on account of reduced allotments, or the absence thereof, in ""A"" sugar permitted to be manufactured. The total amount of ""B"" and ""C"" sugar shall be allocated among the mill districts, and in turn among the plantations adherent thereto, based on their individual total production during the 1932-1933 or 1933-1934 crop, whichever is the largest: Provided, however, That the Governor-General shall have authority to set aside not more than ten per centum of the total amount of ""B"" and ""C"" sugar to be used as amelioration allotments for sugar cane and sugar producers with may be found to deserve such special consideration due their reduced allotments in ""A"" sugar, or the absence thereof.
In those mill districts where the mill or mills had not been in operation for at least three milling seasons up to and including the 1933-1934 crop, their allotment of ""B"" sugar hereunder shall consist of an amount which, together with the allotment of ""A"" sugar to which the mill district would be entitled from a quota of one million fifteen thousand one hundred eighty-five and sixty-eight hundredths short tons would be equal in quantity to the amount it can mill during twelve months of operation.
Section 9. The allotment corresponding to each piece of land under the provisions of this Act shall be deemed to be an improvement attaching to the land entitled thereto. Such allotments shall be transferable only in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be issued by the United States Sugar Authority as regards ""A"" and ""AA"" sugar, and by the Governor-General as regards ""B"" and of ""C"" sugar: Provided, That nothing herein shall be construed as forbidding the consolidation of producing areas within the limits of the plantation.
Mill companies and plantation owners may sell, transfer, or assign their allotments received under the terms of this Act only in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be issued by the United States Sugar Authority in the Philippine Islands as regards ""A"" and ""AA"" sugar, and by the Governor-General as regards ""B"" and ""C"" sugar.

The Governor-General shall charge for the issuance of such licenses a fee of not less than twenty-five pesos nor more than fifty pesos for each one thousand short tons of sugar to be manufactured, or fraction thereof not less than five hundred short tons, the exact amount of the fee to be determined from year to year in accordance with the estimated expenditures for the enforcement of this Act.
