Should said Congress authorize bonds to be issued in an amount less than said twenty-one million five hundred thousand dollars, then the Secretary of War is authorized to issue bonds in the lesser amount authorized. The proceeds of the sale of the said bonds shall be used for the purpose of making funds immediately available for certain public works and for other purposes as hereafter provided.

The bonds may be coupon bonds or registered bonds, convertible, in the discretion of the Secretary of War, into other form, and in the case of the issue or transfer of any registered bonds the same shall be registered in the Treasury of the United States.
