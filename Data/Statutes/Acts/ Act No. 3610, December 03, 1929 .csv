The clues on each share of stock subscribed for by a stockholder shall continue to be paid by the stockholder to the association until the share has been duly withdrawn, cancelled, or forfeited or until the share has reached its matured value that is to say, when the dues paid on each share and the net earnings thereof in accordance with the by-laws, shall amount to the matured value of the share, but such association may issue and sell paid-up stock for cash and also investment stock to be paid in installments, and may pay to the holders of such paid-up stock out of the net profits such rates of dividends as may be fixed from time to time by the board of directors of the association, which shall be expressed in the stock certificates and shall not participate further in the profits or accretions of the association.

At the time of the forfeiture the withdrawal value of the forfeited shares shall be determined and stated by the board of directors, and the defaulting stockholder shall be entitled to receive such value without interest upon such notice as is required of a withdrawing stockholder.
