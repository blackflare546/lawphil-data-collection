AN ACT TO PREVENT DISTRESS AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS FROM FAILURE OF FOOD STAPLES, MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.(awÞhi(
Whereas the state of the supply of food staples, which made necessary the passage of Act Numbered Two thousand and seventy-six, continues to exist and will probably so continue for the larger part of the present year;
Whereas said Act Numbered Two thousand and seventy-six, by its terms, ceases to be in force on February first, nineteen hundred and twelve; and
Whereas to prevent great distress among the people of the Philippine Islands during the period of scarcity, means must be provided to meet conditions as they arise: Now, therefore,
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Legislature, that:
Section 1. The Governor-General is hereby authorized to take such steps as in his judgment may be necessary and warranted by authority-circumstances to prevent the price of rice from rising above a reasonable rate, and to supply, through provincial and municipal governments and such other agencies as may be most effective, rice or other foodstuffs to the people at reasonable prices, and there are hereby appropriated from any funds not otherwise appropriated in the Insular Treasury, such sums as may be necessary to carry into effect the purposes of this Act, the rice the purchase of which is     
hereby authorized not to exceed fifteen thousand tons: Provided, That such sums shall not exceed an amount equal to the customs dues on such rice and other expenses and liabilities necessarily and unavoidably incident to the execution of the purposes of this Act.
Section 2. The Governor-General will, from time to time, inform the Philippine Legislature of the measures taken and disbursements made in accordance with section one of this Act, and will as soon as possible recommend to said Legislature measures of a permanent character tending to secure a sufficient supply of food grains within reach of the people.
Section 3. This Act  shall take effect on its passage and shall remain in force until the first of February, nineteen hundred and thirteen.
Enacted, February 6, 1912.
