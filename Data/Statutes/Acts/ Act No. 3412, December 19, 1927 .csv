""Section I. Any male of the age of sixteen years or upwards, and any female of the age of fourteen years or upwards, not disqualified by law, may contract marriage.""
Section 2. Section five of General Orders, Numbered Sixty-eight, is hereby amended to read as follows:
""Section V. Marriage may be solemnized by a judge of any court inferior to the Supreme Court, justice of the peace, or priest or minister of the gospel of any denomination or religion, provided the latter are duly registered in the Philippine Library and Museum, as provided in this section. Every priest or minister of the gospel authorized by his church, sect, or religion to solemnize marriage shall send to the Philippine Library and Museum, together with a copy of his appointment or authorization, a sworn statement setting forth his full name and domicile, and that he is authorized by his church, sect, or religion to solemnize marriage. The Director of the Philippine Library and Museum, upon receiving such sworn statement containing the information required, and after satisfying himself that the church, sect, or religion of the applicant operates in the Philippine Islands and is in good repute, shall record the name of such priest or minister in a suitable register and issue to him a certificate of registration which such priest or minister shall be obliged to exhibit to contracting parties demanding the same or to their parents, grandparents, guardians, or persons in charge. No priest or minister not registered as hereinbefore provided may solemnize marriage.
""Except when either of the contracting parties is at the point of death, no marriage shall be solemnized in the Philippine Islands without a license first being issued by the municipal secretary of the municipality where the woman has her habitual residence, or by the clerk of the municipal court in the City of Manila. Said officials shall issue the proper license if each of the contracting parties swears separately to an application in writing setting forth that such party has the necessary qualifications for contracting marriage in conformity with this Act. Such application shall in so far as possible contain the following data:
""1. Full name of the contracting party ................................
""2. Place of birth ..............................................................

If either of the contracting parties is unable to produce his baptismal or birth certificate or a certified copy of either because of the destruction or loss of the original, such party may furnish in lieu thereof an instrument drawn up before a justice of the peace or notary public and containing the sworn declaration of two witnesses of lawful age, of either sex, setting forth the full name, profession, and residence of such contracting party and of his or her parents, if known, and the place and date of birth of such party.

At the expiration of this term, a license shall issue: Provided, however, That in case any such applicant states in writing and under oath that the rules and practices of the church, sect, or religion under which such applicant desires to contract marriage require banns or publications prior to the solemnization of the marriage, it shall not be necessary for the municipal secretary to make the publication required in this paragraph, and in this case the license shall issue immediately after the filing of the application and shall state the church, sect, or religion in which the marriage is to be solemnized.
""A license shall not issue if the male is less than twenty years or the female less than eighteen years of age, unless the father or in his default the mother, guardian, or person having charge of the infant consents thereto in writing, or if the applicants are related to each other within the degrees specified in section two of this General Order. In case the father, mother, guardian, or person having charge of the infant does not appear to give such consent, the municipal secretary or clerk of the municipal court of Manila shall accept a certificate of consent signed before two witnesses by such father or mother, guardian, or person having charge of the infant and acknowledged under oath before an officer authorized to administer oaths.
