""(b) Municipalities of less than two thousand inhabitants may be incorporated under the provisions of this Act, or may, upon petition signed by a majority of the qualified electors thereof, be attached as a barrio to an adjacent and incorporated municipality, if the council of the latter shall grant said petition and the Commission shall approve it.ℒαwρhi৷

""(d) In case of controversy, the Commission shall determine to which class a town shall belong, and thereafter, if its population shall sufficiently increase or diminish, it shall pass to a higher or lower class by order of the provincial board.
""(e) In case the class of a municipality shall be raised the additional councilors appropriate to its new class shall be obtained by electing at the regular election next following the change one-half of the total number of councilors prescribed for municipalities of that class and at each succeeding election an equal number. During the interim between, the change and the seating of the councilors first elected thereafter the council shall consist of the former number of councilors. After the seating of said first-elected councilors and until the seating of those next elected it shall consist of a number midway between the former number and the number prescribed for the new class.
""(f) in case a municipality is reduced in class all of the councilors in office shall be allowed to serve out their full terms, except that in case of death, resignation, or removal of any such councilor the vacancy thereby, caused shall not be filled unless such vacancy reduces the number of councilors below that proscribed for the new class, in which case the vacancy shall be filled as hereinafter in this Act provided. At the election next following the change of class the number of councilors elected shall be equal to one-half of the number prescribed for the new class, and at each succeeding election an equal number shall be elected.""
