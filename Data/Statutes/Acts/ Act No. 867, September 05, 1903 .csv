""(c) On or before the first of December of each year, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall recommend to the Governor the names of the judges who should be assigned to duty as above during the court vacation. In making his recommendation the Chief Justice shall select the five judges with a view to the convenient exercise of interlocutory jurisdiction by each of the judges selected in two neighboring districts, so that for interlocutory purposes there may be a judge available in every three districts. The Civil Governor shall, on or before the first of January each year, issue an executive order naming the judge of the Supreme Court and of all Courts of First Instance who shall remain on duty, subject to call for the purposes of interlocutory jurisdiction, throughout the Islands. In  this executive order the Governor shall assign to the regular judges of the Courts of First Instance the districts over which, in addition to their own districts, they shall during vacation exercise interlocutory jurisdiction. The assignment of judges for vacation duty, shall be so arranged that no judge shall be assigned for vacation duty more than once in three years.
