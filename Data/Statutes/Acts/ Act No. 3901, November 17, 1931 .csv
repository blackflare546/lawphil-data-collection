AN ACT TO AMEND SECTION TWENTY-NINE OF ACT NUMBERED FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY-SIX, KNOWN AS THE LAND REGISTRATION ACT, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:
Section 1. Section twenty-nine of Act Numbered Four hundred and ninety-six, known as the Land Registration Act, is hereby amended to read as follows:
""Section 29. After the filing of the application and before the issuance of the decree of title by the Chief of the General Land Registration Office the land therein described may be dealt with and instruments relating thereto shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds at any time before issuance of the decree of title, in the same manner as if no application had been made. The interested party may, however, present such instruments to the Court of First Instance instead of presenting them to the office of the register of deeds, together with a motion that the same be considered in relation with the application, and the court, after notice to the parties, shall order such land registered subject to the encumbrance created by said instruments, or order the decree of registration issued in the name of the buyer or of the person to whom the property has been conveyed by said instruments. If such motion is made after the decision has become final, the court shall require the interested party, before granting his motion, to pay the fees which the register of deeds would collect in accordance with section one hundred and fourteen of this Act, as amended, if such instruments had been presented for registration in the office of the register of deeds after registration of the original certificate of title. If the order of the court above mentioned is received by the Chief of the General Land Registration Office after issuance of the decree of title, such order shall forthwith be forwarded by said officer to the register of deeds concerned, for compliance therewith. If the proceedings upon the application end in the issuance of a decree of title, the property included therein shall, as soon as said decree has been registered in the office of the register of deeds, as provided in section forty-one, become registered land under this Act, and thereafter all deeds relating to such property shall be registered only in the registration book of property registered under this Act.""
Section 2. This Act shall take effect on its approval.1a—àphi1
