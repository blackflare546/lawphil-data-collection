It shall be the duty of the Attorney-General in person or by deputy to appear and defend all such suits with the aid of the fiscal of the province in which the land lies or the City Attorney of the city of Manila as the case may be: Provided, however, That nothing in this Act shall be construed to deprive the plaintiff of any action which he may have against any person for such loss or damage or deprivation of land or of any estate or interest therein without joining the Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago as a defendant therein.
Section 103. If the assurance fund at any time be not sufficient to, meet the amount called for by such judgment, the Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago shall make up the deficiency from any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated; and in such case any sums thereafter received by the Treasurer on account of the assurance fund shall be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury until the amount paid on account of the deficiency shall have been made up.

Any sum so recovered by the Treasurer shall be paid into the Treasury of the Philippine Islands to the account of the assurance fund.
Section 105. The income of the assurance fund shall be added to the principal and invested until said fund amounts to the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, and thereafter the income of such fund shall be paid into the Insular Treasury for the general purposes of the Insular Government.
The term ""dollars"" wherever used in this Act shall be construed to mean money of the United States.

Nor shall any plaintiff recover as compensation in an action under this Act more than the fair market value of the real estate at the time when he suffered the loss, damage, or deprivation thereof.
Section 107. All actions for compensation under this Act by reason nf any loss or damage or deprivation of land or any estate or interest i herein shall be begun within the period of six years from the time when the right to bring or take such action or proceeding first accrued, and not afterwards: Provided, That the right of action herein provided shall survive to the personal representative of the person sustaining loss or damage, if deceased, unless barred in his lifetime: And provided further, That if at the time when such right of action first accrues the person entitled to bring such action or take such proceeding is within the age of majority, or insane, or imprisoned, such person, or anyone claiming from, by, or under him may bring the action or take the proceeding at any time within two years after such disability is removed, notwithstanding the time before limited in that behalf has expired.
POWERS OF ATTORNEY.
Section 108. Any person may by power of attorney procure land to be registered and convey or otherwise deal with registered land, but the letters of attorney shall be acknowledged before a notary public or a judge or clerk of a court of record attested by at least one witness and shall be filed with the clerk or register of deeds of the province where the land lies, and registered. Any instrument revoking such letters shall be acknowledged, attested, and registered in like former.
LOST DUPLICATE CERTIFICATE.
Section 109. If a duplicate certificate is lost or destroyed, or can not be produced by a grantee, heir, devisee, assignee, or other person applying for the entry of a new certificate to him or for the registration of any instrument, a suggestion of the fact of such loss or destruction may be filed by the registered owner or other person in interest, and registered. The court may thereupon, upon the petition of the registered owner or other person in interest, after notice and hearing, direct the issue of a new duplicate certificate, which shall contain a memorandum of the fact that it is issued in place of the lost duplicate certificate, but shall in respects be entitled to like faith and credit as the original duplicate, and shall thereafter be regarded as the original duplicate for all the purposes of this Act.
ADVERSE CLAIMS.
Section 110. Whoever claims any right or interest in registered land adverse to the registered owner, arising subsequent to the date of the original registration, may if no other provision is made in this Act for registering the same, make a statement in writing setting forth fully his alleged right or interest, and bow or under whom acquired, and a reference to the volume and page of the certificate of title of the registered owner, and a description of the land in which the right or interest is claimed. The statement shall be signed and sworn to, and shall state the adverse claimant's residence and designate a place at which all notices may be served upon him. This statement shall be entitled to registration as an adverse claim, and the court, upon a petition of any party in interest, shall, grant a speedy hearing upon the question of the validity of such adverse claim and shall enter such decree therein as justice and equity may require. If the claim is adjudged to be invalid, the registration shall be canceled. If in any case the court after notice and hearing shall find that a claim thus registered was frivolous or vexatious, it may tax the adverse claimant double or treble costs in its discretion.
SURRENDER OF DUPLICATE CERTIFICATES.
Section 111. In every case where the clerk or any register of deeds is requested to enter a new certificate in pursuance of an instrument purporting to be executed by the registered owner, or by reason of any instrument or proceedings which divest the title of the registered owner against his consent, if the outstanding owner's duplicate certificate is not presented for cancellation when such request, is made, the clerk or register of deeds shall not enter a new certificate, but the person claiming to be entitled thereto may apply by petition to the court. The court, after hearing, may order the registered owner or any person withholding the duplicate to surrender the same, and direct the entry of a new certificate upon such surrender.
If in any case the person withholding the duplicate certificate is not amenable to the process of the court, or if for any reason the outstanding owner's duplicate certificate can not be delivered up, the court may by decree annul the same and order a new certificate of title to be entered. Such new certificate and all duplicates thereof shall contain a memorandum of the annulment of the, outstanding duplicate.
If in any case an outstanding mortgagee's or lessee's duplicate, certificate is not produced and surrendered when the mortgage is discharged or extinguished or the lease is terminated, like proceedings may be had to obtain registration as in the case of the nonproduction of an owner's duplicate.
