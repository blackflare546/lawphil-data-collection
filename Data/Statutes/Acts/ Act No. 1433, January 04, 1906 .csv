During the interim between the change and the seating of the councilors first elected thereafter the council shall consist of the former number of councilors. After the seating of said first elected councilors and until the seating of those next elected it shall consist of a number midway between the former number and the number prescribed for the new class.
""(f) In case a municipality is reduced in class all of the councilors in office shall be allowed to serve out their full terms, except that in case of death, resignation, or removal of any such councilor the vacancy thereby caused shall not lie filled unless such vacancy reduces the number of councilors below that prescribed for the new class, in which case the vacancy shall be filled as hereinafter in this Act provided. At the election next following the change of class the number of councilors elected shall be equal to one-half of the number prescribed for the new class, and at each succeeding election an equal number shall be elected.1a—àphi1""
