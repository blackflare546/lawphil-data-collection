Whereas it appears that the treasurer of the Province of Abra made no effort to collect the cedula tax for the year nineteen hundred and three from the municipality of San Juan, now a part of the municipality of Dolores, or the township of San Quintin, in the then Province of Abra, until after the expiration of the period within which this tax might have been paid without penalty; and Whereas the inhabitants subject to this tax were willing to pay the same within the legal period had they been given opportunity to do so, and were obliged to pay a line of one peso each for having failed to pay the tax within the legal period, although such failure was not due to any fault of their own: Now, therefore,
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Commission, that:
