Such demands shall be made to the president, who shall promptly refer them for settlement to a board consisting of the vice-president, the municipal treasurer and himself. Where the value of land offered as a qualification for voting is disputed, its value as assessed for taxation shall conclusively determine the same.

(c) Special elections, duly called in accordance with the provisions of section thirteen, subsection (b), shall be held on the fourth Tuesday succeeding the call for the same.

The municipality shall pay for the ballots, which shall be furnished at cost price. Ballots on other than the above-described official forms will be illegal, unless the provincial governor shall fail to provide the blanks, or to provide them in sufficient number. In the latter event, the board of judges will determine and provide the form to be employed.
(c) Each elector shall fill out his ballot at one of the tables provided for the purpose, by writing in the.names of the persons for whom he desires to vote. He shall then fold his ballot and deposit it in the ballot box, first stating to the board of judges his name and the barrio in which he resides. When he has voted, the chairman shall check his name on the official list of voters, in order to avoid the possibility of his voting a second time.
(d) The board of judges shall identify the voters, and shall exclude the ballot of anyone whose name is found not to be included in the official list.

(f) Any elector who can not read and write shall be assisted in the preparation of his ballot by the two tellers, who shall accompany him to a table. One of the tellers, in the presence of the other, shall thereupon fill out a ballot in accordance with the dictation of the elector, who shall then deposit it in the usual manner.
(g) Before an election the board of judges shall provide a suitable ballot box with a slit in the top for the insertion of ballots. Immediately before the voting begins they shall see that the box is empty and shall lock the same. While an election is in progress the ballot box shall be kept locked and the key shall lie constantly in the possession of the chairman of the board of judges, who will not unlock the box or allow it to be unlocked until the board is ready to count the ballots. The box shall not be removed from the presence of the board of judges during the election or until the ballots are counted and the result declared.
(h) The hours for voting shall be from eight antemeridian to four postmeridian, at which latter time the election shall close.

Section 12. A plurality of votes shall be sufficient to elect.
Section 13. (a) Immediately after the close of the election the box shall be opened by the chairman in the presence of the board, the ballots shall be canvassed by the board, a certificate of the result of the election shall be prepared in duplicate and signed by the members of the board and by the tellers, and the certificate shall be a sufficient warrant for those elected to assume their offices, unless objections are filed as follows: A duplicate, containing the additional statement that a term of three days is granted in which any resident of the town can present to the board, or to the chairman thereof, in writing, such objections as he may deem just and legal against those declared elected, shall be prepared by the board and posted at the main entrance of the municipal building.

(b) On the day following said term of three days a duplicate of the election certificate and the objections made, if any, shall he sent by the chairman of the board of judges to the provincial board. Should the provincial board, upon investigation and after hearing of evidence, if necessary, find the election legal, they shall, within seven days after the receipt of said documents, direct the newly elected officers to qualify and enter upon their duties on the day fixed by this Act, but, if the provincial board determine that there has been an illegality committed in the election of any officer or that any candidate returned is not eligible, they shall so declare in writing, with the reasons therefor, and shall order a special election to fill the vacancies thus occasioned and shall certify their finding and order to the municipal secretary, who shall spread the same on the records of the council.

Section 80. In case the taxpayer shall not redeem the land sold as above provided within one year from the date of sale the provincial treasurer or his deputy, in the name of such treasurer, shall, as grantor, execute a deed in form and effect sufficient under the laws of the islands to convey to the purchaser so much of the land against which the taxes have been assessed as has been sold, free from all liens of any kind whatsoever, and the deeds shall succinctly recite all the proceedings upon which the validity if the sale depends.

Section 84. No court shall entertain any suit assailing the validity of a tax assessed under this act until the taxpayer shall have paid, under protest, the taxes assessed against him nor shall any court declare any tax invalid by reason of irregularities or informalities in the proceedings of the officers charged with the assessment or collection of the taxes, or of a failure to perform their duties within the time herein specified for their performance, unless such irregularities, informalities or failures shall have impaired the substantial rights of the taxpayer; nor shall any court declare any tax assessed under the provisions of this act, invalid except upon condition that the taxpayer shall pay the just amount of his tax, as determined by the court in the pending proceeding.

The money so paid into court shall belong to the purchaser at the tax sale if the deed is declared invalid, and shall be returned to the depositor should he fail in his action.
Section 86. No court shall declare any such sale invalid by reason of any irregularities or informalities in the proceedings of the officer charged with the duty of making the sale or by reason of failure by him to perform his duties within the time herein specified for their performance, unless such irregularities, informalities or failures shall have impaired the substantial rights of the taxpayer.
