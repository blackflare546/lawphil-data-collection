AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE DETENTION AND DEPORTATION OF STOWAWAYS ARRIVING IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS ON TRANSPORTS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY.
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Legislature, that:
Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any stowaway to enter or attempt to enter the Philippine Islands from any vessel operated as a transport of the United States Army arriving at any port of the Philippine Islands from any foreign port or from any port of the United States or of any possession thereof, exclusive of the Philippine Islands.
Section 2. The Insular Collector of Customs or any peace Arrest and officer is hereby authorized to apprehend and cause to be detained in Bilibid Prison and, the consent of the proper military authorities being first obtained, the Insular Collector of Customs is hereby authorized to cause to be deported, upon the first available transport of the United States Army, any person found to have violated the provisions of section one of this Act: Provided, however, That such detention shall not extend beyond the time of sailing of the first transport to leave the Philippine Islands after the apprehension of such person as herein provided, and shall cease immediately after the military authorities notify the Collector of Customs that they are unwilling to take back such stowaway. Upon the certificate of a medical officer to the effect that the health or safety of such person would be unduly imperiled by immediate deportation, such person may be held for treatment until such time as he may, in the opinion of such medical officer, be safely deported.(awÞhi(
