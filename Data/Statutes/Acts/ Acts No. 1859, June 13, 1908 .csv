Whereas the Congress of the  United  States has passed an Act to increase the membership of the Philippine Commission and authorizing the President to create a new Executive Department in the Philippine Government and to embrace therein such existing Bureaus as he may designate: and
Whereas the creation of such new Executive Department will necessitate a redistribution of the various Bureaus and Offices among the Executive Departments of the Government: Now, therefore,

Section 1. Whenever, ill the judgment of the Governor-General, the exigencies of the public service shall so require. The Governor-General, with the approval of the President of the  United  States of America, may transfer from the jurisdiction of one Executive Department to another such Bureau or Bureaus or Office or Offices as he may designate, and may divide such Bureau or Bureaus or Office or Offices as he may deem necessary and transfer the parts thereof together with  their personnel  to the jurisdiction  of such Executive Department, Bureau, or Office as he may designate or in his discretion and with such approval may consolidate or otherwise rearrange any such Bureau or Office so divided : and shall have power to change the name of any Department when in his opinion the transfer of Bureaus from one Department to another or the reorganization  of Departments may make  such  change of name expedient: Provided, however, That no new position shall be created under the provisions of this Act nor shall additional expense be incurred by reason of changes made under the authority hereby conferred.
Section 2.1aшphi1  Whenever the Governor-General shall have transferred a Bureau or Office from the jurisdiction of one  Department to another, the powers and duties with respect to such Bureau formerly exercised by the Secretary of the Department from which the transfer was made shall also therein be transferred to the Secretary of the Department to which the Bureau was transferred.
Section 3. This Act shall take effect on its passage.
