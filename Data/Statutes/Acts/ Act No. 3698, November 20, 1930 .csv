AN ACT TO MAKE ALL PROVINCIAL TREASURERS AND SOME OF THEIR DEPUTIES REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INSULAR TREASURER FOR THE EXECUTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS GOVERNING MUTUAL BENEFIT, RELIEF, AND BENEVOLENT SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:
Section 1. All provincial treasurers of regular and special provinces are hereby made chief representatives of the Insular Treasurer in their respective provinces for the execution and enforcement of all laws now in force or hereafter enacted, governing mutual benefit, relief, and benevolent societies and associations. To assist the provincial treasurers in the performance of their duties under this Act, the Insular Treasurer may designate as his representatives in each province such deputies of the provincial treasurer as the latter may recommend, and said representatives shall be under the immediate supervision and control of such provincial treasurer. It shall be the duty of the provincial treasurer to report to the Insular Treasurer the existence or organization of all mutual benefit, relief, and benevolent societies and associations in his province, to require such societies or associations to secure licenses before beginning operations, to make a careful examination, either by himself or through his duly authorized deputies, into the financial affairs and condition of such societies or associations as often as the Insular Treasurer may deem necessary, and to submit to the latter a written report of such examination and perform such other duties as the Insular Treasurer may prescribe: Provided, That nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to prevent the Insular Treasurer from ordering an examination to be made into the financial affairs and condition of any mutual benefit, relief, and benevolent society or association independently from any provincial treasurer.
Section 2. All representatives of the Insular Treasurer properly constituted under this Act shall, in the performance of their duties as such representatives of the Insular Treasurer, have the same power and authority as conferred upon the Insular Treasurer, and any refusal to submit to their supervision or comply with their requirements in the lawful exercise of their power and in the performance of their duties as such representatives shall entail the penalties prescribed in section twenty-seven hundred and forty-three of the Administrative Code, as amended by Act Numbered Thirty-six hundred and twelve.1a—àphi1
Section 3. This Act shall take effect on its approval.
