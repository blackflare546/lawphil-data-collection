Section 2. Any municipal president is authorized to allot to the citizens of his municipality such public land as there may be within the boundaries of the municipality at present unoccupied, for the planting of the seed and the raising of the crops provided for in this Act.
Section 3. The crops planted and gathered under this Act shall belong to the persons planting and gathering the same, even though they be planted upon the public land, and no rent for the public land thus used shall be chargeable against the persons so using same.
Section 4.

The seed furnished by a provincial board to any municipality shall be receipted for by the municipal president and paid for out of the municipal funds by order of the municipal council. The seed shall then be sold to the residents of the municipalities at the cost price thereof. If any person having land of his own, or tilling the public land, shall be known to be unable to pay for the seed, the municipal president may furnish him the seed without receiving the price thereof, in which case he shall collect an amount equal to the value of the seed furnished from the new crop, and shall sell the same and reimburse the municipal treasury with the proceeds.
Section 5. Each municipal president shall keep a record of the amount of seed furnished to the inhabitants of his municipality and the number of hectares planted by each inhabitant in accordance with the requirements of this Act, and it shall be his further duty to make monthly reports of his proceedings under this Act to the provincial governor.1a—àphi1
