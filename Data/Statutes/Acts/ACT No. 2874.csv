Section 96. (Missing portion in DENR file)
Section 97. The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources may order such improvements and crops to be appraised separately, for sale to the new applicant or grantee, or may declare such land open only to sale or lease.

Section 99. All actions for the reversion to the Government of lands of the public domain or improvements thereon shall be instituted by the Attorney-General or the officer acting in his stead, in the proper courts, in the name of the Government of the Philippine Islands.
Section 100. Any person, corporation, or association may file an objection under oath to any application or concession under this Act, grounded on any reason sufficient under this Act for the denial or cancellation of the application or the denial of the patent or grant.
