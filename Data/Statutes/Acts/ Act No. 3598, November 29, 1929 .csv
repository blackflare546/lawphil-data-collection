""(c) Except as otherwise specially provided, he shall, in person or by deputy, serve all writs, execute all processes, and carry into effect all orders issuing from the Court of First Instance or made by any judge thereof; and in the City of Manila the sheriff shall serve or execute civil writs, processes, and orders issued from the Supreme Court or any inferior or superior court or by a judge of any such court. Orders and processes in criminal cases from whatever court or by whatever judge issued, shall be served or executed in the City of Manila by members of the police department of the city, and in the provinces warrants of arrest in criminal cases shall be executed by members of the Philippine Constabulary or of the municipal police force, though the same may also be served or executed with equal effect by the sheriff.""

""Section 184. Appointment of deputies.-The provincial sheriffs in provinces of the first and second class may appoint three deputies; in provinces of the third and fourth class, two deputies; and in provinces of the fifth and sixth class, one deputy.
