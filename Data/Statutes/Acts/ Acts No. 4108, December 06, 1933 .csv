In this case the sheriff shall not be bound to keep the property claimed unless the plaintiff files a bond indemnifying the officer against such claim. The amount of the bond shall not be greater than the value of the property in the local market, and in case of disagreement as to the value or the terms or sureties of the bond, the same shall be decided by the court having jurisdiction of the case in which the writ was issued, after hearing the sheriff, the plaintiff, and the third party. Upon the filing of such bond, the sheriff shall forthwith proceed to comply with the writ, unless an injunction has been issued, in which case, as well as in the event that action is not brought upon the bond within one hundred and twenty days after the sale, the same shall be understood to be cancelled.
""No claim to property levied on by the sheriff shall be valid against the latter, or shall be received or be notice of any rights against him, unless a claim has been made to said property by a third party as provided in this section t and said claim has been enforced by the proper action within one hundred and twenty days after the sale.
""When the execution or attachment is for the benefit of the Government of the Philippine Islands and is made under the immediate supervision of the Solicitor-General, the indemnity bond mentioned shall not be required, and in case the sheriff is sued for damages as a result of such execution or attachment, said sheriff shall be represented by the Solicitor-General, and if he is held liable therefor by final decision, the amount shall be paid by the Insular Treasurer from the funds appropriated for said purpose.
""Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the owner of the property levied on from vindicating his claim thereto by any proper action within the period established by the laws governing prescription.""
