Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to prepare, sell, traffic in or in any manner dispose of, in the Philippine Islands, for the treatment of domestic animals, any virus, serum, toxin, or analogous products that are of no value or the value whereof is inferior to that announced on the label, or which are contaminated or adulterated or dangerous or noxious. It shall likewise be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to sell, traffic in or in any manner dispose of any virus, serum, toxin, or analogous products prepared in the Philippine Islands and used for the treatment of domestic animals, unless such virus, serum, toxin or analogous products have been prepared in accordance with regulations to be promulgated by the Director of Agriculture, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, in an establishment licensed by said Director of Agriculture, such license being neither suspended nor revoked.
Section 2. It is hereby prohibited to import into the Philippine Islands, without permission of the Director of Agriculture, any virus, serum, toxin or analogous products for use in the treatment of domestic animals, and to import, for such treatment, any virus, serum, toxin or analogous products that are worthless or inefficacious or the value whereof is inferior to that announced on the label, or which are contaminated or adulterated or dangerous or noxious. The Director of Agriculture or his authorized agent are hereby empowered to examine and inspect all viruses, serums, toxins and analogous products imported or to be imported into the Philippines for use in the treatment of domestic animals, in order to determine whether they are worthless or inefficient, or whether their value is inferior to that announced on the label, or whether they are adulterated or contaminated or dangerous or noxious, and if they are, to prohibit their entry and order them destroyed or returned to their place of origin at the expense of the owner or importer.ℒαwρhi৷
