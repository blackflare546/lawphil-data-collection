Section 2. It shall be the duty of any institution to which minors are committed as provided in section one hereof to hold and keep them in safe custody, to instruct them in some useful art or trade, and to do such other things as may be necessary for their moral and physical welfare.
Section 3. Minor prisoners now confined in Bilibid Prison or in any-provincial jail who, if males, were under the age of sixteen at the time of commitment, or, if females, under the age of eighteen at the time of commitment, may be transferred by executive order of the Governor-General for the period of the unexpired portion of their sentences to any of the institutions mentioned in section one hereof: Provided, however, That the Governor-General prior to making transfer of any minor from Bilibid Prison or any provincial prison or jail to any such institution shall take into consideration the religion of the minor and that of his parents or next of kin and shall not transfer such minor without the approval of the parents or next of kin to any private institution not under the control and supervision of the religions sect or denomination to which such minor and his parents or next of kin belong: And provided further, That any minor transferred as prescribed in this section to any of the institutions mentioned in section one hereof may be retransferred by executive order of the Governor-General to the prison or jail from which lie was taken, there to be confined for the unexpired portion of his sentence.
Section 4. Any minor who during the period of his commitment to any of the institutions mentioned in section one hereof shall be found incorrigible or who shall be an improper subject for detention in such institution shall be returned to the court which committed him, and the court, if it finds such minor incorrigible or an improper subject for detention in such institution, shall enter such judgment and pass such sentence as would have been lawful at the time of the original commitment of the minor.1a—àphi1
