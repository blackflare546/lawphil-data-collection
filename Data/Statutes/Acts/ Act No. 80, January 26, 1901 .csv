Section 1. It shall be the duty of the heads of departments and offices in the Philippine civil service to require of all employees of whatever grade or class not less than six hours of labor each day, not including time for lunch and exclusive of Sundays and days declared public holidays by law or executive order, but the head of any Department or Office may, in the interest of the public service, extend the hours of labor herein specified for any or all of the employees in his office, and in case of such extension it shall be without additional compensation.
Section 2. The head of any department or office may grant leave of absence with pay during a calendar year to each employee, exclusive of Sundays and days declared public holidays by law or executive order, in accordance with the following schedule: An employee receiving an annual salary of less than six hundred dollars shall be granted fifteen days' leave; an employee receiving an annual salary of six hundred dollars or more, but less than one thousand dollars, shall be granted twenty days' leave; an employee receiving an annual salary of one thousand dollars or more, but less than one thousand eight hundred dollars, shall be granted thirty days' leave; an employee receiving an annual salary of one thousand eight hundred dollars or more shall he granted thirty-five days' leave; an employee elects in any one year to postpone any or all of the leave to which he is entitled under this section, such leave shall accumulate, and in case he is granted leave for the purpose of visiting the United States he shall be allowed with half pay in addition to his leave, the actual and necessary time occupied by him in going to and returning from San Francisco: Provided, That such leave to visit the United States under these conditions shall not be granted to any employee more than once in three years, or to any employee who has not accumulated to his credit leave allowed for two full wars. The provisions of this section shall be retroactive in effect so as to entitle employees of the civil service in the Philippine Islands whether serving as such by regular appointment or by detail from the Army or Navy of the United States, previous to this Act to any accumulated leave to which they would have been entitled had this Act been in effect at the date of their employment or detail.
Section 3. In exceptional and meritorious cases where an employee is personally ill and also in cases where any member of the immediate family of an employee is afflicted with a contagious disease, making the presence of such employee in the Department or Office in which he is employed unsafe for the health of his fellow employees, the head of the Department or Office may in his discretion, grant to such employee, in addition to the leave provided in section two, a leave of absence not exceeding sixty days in any calendar year. Further leave, if granted, shall be without pay, but when leave with and without pay of the employee under this section aggregates more than six months he shall be immediately separated from the service.
Section 4. The appointment of persons residing in the United States to the Philippine civil service shall be subject to the following conditions:

(1) A person residing in the United States who is appointed to the Philippine civil service shall pay his traveling expenses from the place of his residence in the United States to San Francisco, but his traveling expenses from San Francisco to Manila shall be borne by the Insular Government if he shall come by the steamer and route directed by the Chief Executive of the Islands.
(2) He shall be allowed half salary from the date of embarkation at San Francisco and full salary from the date of his arrival in the Islands; provided, that he proceeds directly to the Islands, otherwise he shall be allowed half salary for such time only as is ordinarily required to perform the journey between such two points.
(3) A person who has been employed in the Philippine civil service for three years or more after the passage of the Civil Service Act shall, if he so requests, upon his retirement from the service, be furnished with transportation from Manila to San Francisco and shall be allowed half salary for thirty days, in addition to full salary for the period to which he may be entitled as leave of absence under the provisions of this Act.1a—àphi1
