It shall cause to be prosecuted all violations of sanitary laws, and shall enforce the regulations of the Board of Health for the Philippine islands and of the provincial board of health for the province in which the municipality is situated. It shall have power and authority to abate nuisances endangering the public health, to remove the cause of any special disease or mortality, and to make and enforce such quarantine regulations with reference to its municipality as it shall deem necessary. It shall draft and recommend to the municipal council suitable ordinances for carrying into effect the provisions of subsections (l), (m), (n), (o), (p), (q), (r), and (s) of section thirty-nine of the Municipal Code. During epidemics of contagious or infectious disease affecting the inhabitants or the domestic animals of the municipality, or of any of its barrios, and at such other times as may be deemed necessary by the municipal council, it shall appoint such sanitary inspectors as the municipal council may authorize.
