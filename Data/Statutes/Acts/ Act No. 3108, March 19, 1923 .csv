Section 20. Whenever it appears to the Commission that a public highway and a railroad cross one another, or that a public highway and a street railway cross one another, or that a railroad and a street railway cross one another at the same level, and that conditions at such grade crossing make it necessary for the protection of the traveling public at such grade crossing that gates be erected or that some other reasonable provision for the protection of the traveling public at such grade crossing should be adopted, the Commission may order and direct such railroad company, or such street railway company, or either or both of them, to install such protective device or devices or adopt such other reasonable provision for the protection of the traveling public at such crossing as in the discretion of the Commission shall be necessary.
Section 21.
