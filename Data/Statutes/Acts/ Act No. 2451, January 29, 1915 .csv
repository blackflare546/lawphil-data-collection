AN ACT AMENDING PARAGRAPH EIGHT OF SECTION TWELVE OF ACT NUMBERED ELEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY-EIGHT BY PROVIDING THAT ALL TIMBER CUT IN PUBLIC FORESTS SHALL BE MEASURED IN THE ROUND AND SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZING A REASONABLE DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN NATURAL DEFECTS, EXCEPT AS HEREIN OTHERWISE PROVIDED.
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Legislature, that:
Section 1. Paragraph  eight of section twelve of Act Numbered Eleven hundred and forty-eight is hereby amended to read as follows:
""All timber shall be measured and manifested in the round or squared, before being sawn or manufactured. The volume of all round timber shall be ascertained by multiplying the area of the small end by the length of the log, the diameter of the log to be measured exclusive of the bark: Provided, That where the small end of a log is irregular, the average diameter shall be used: And provided further, That in order to ascertain the volume of a log more than eight meters long, the diameter of the middle of said log, or the average of the diameters at both ends thereof shall be used as basis.  If a log in the round, cut under license, is measured and manifested by forest officers, the Director of Forestry shall make due allowance for rot, cavities, or other natural defects; but from any decision of the Director of Forestry in this respect, an appeal shall be to the Secretary of the Interior, whose decision shall be final. The manifests of timber cut by licensees operating sawmills in or near the forest shall be attested by forest officers whenever practicable.
""Notwithstanding the foregoing provision regarding measurement in the round, licensees with sawmills may measure their timber or cause or allow the same to be measured after it is sawn, provided they pay for each thousand board feet of lumber of the first and second groups a sum of not less than ten pesos, and of the other groups of not less than five pesos, as forestry charges, in the discretion of the Director of Forestry and after agreement with the same, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.(awÞhi( These agreements shall be for one year, but shall be subject to renewal.
""The volume of squared timber shall be ascertained by multiplying the average of the cross section measured by the length, to which twenty-five per centum shall be added for loss in squaring: Provided, That the privilege of manifesting timber after squaring shall be granted only to licensees who have squared their logs in the forest with the ax and intend to take it to the market in this form. If sawn or otherwise manufactured timber is found which has not been manifested in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the corresponding forest charges will be assessed on twice the volume of the actual contents of such sawn or manufactured timber.""
Section 2. All Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent with the conflicting Acts re-provisions of this Act are hereby repealed.
Section 3. This Act shall take effect six months after its passage.
