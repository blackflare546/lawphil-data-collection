In case of a failure to agree, the Secretary of the Interior shall render the decision.
Section 4. The Provinces of Ilocos Sur and La Union shall maintain respectively the existing roads and trails and continue the policy of improvement and extension of these roads and trails and of others necessary to facilitate commerce between the coast towns and the interior territory added to said provinces, and shall pursue, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Interior, a definite policy of liberal appropriations, not only from provincial revenues but from all other funds at the disposal of the provincial boards, for the maintenance, extension and improvement of all local government activities, especially primary schools within the ceded territory.
Section 5. This Act shall take effect on its approval.
