AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE PROVINCIAL BOARDS OF PROVINCES WHICH ARE OPERATING LAUNCHES FOR THE USE OF THEIR PROVINCIAL OFFICERS TO CHARGE REASONABLE RATES OF FARE FOR TRANSPORTATION OF NONOFFICIAL PASSENGERS.
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Commission, that:
Section 1. In any province in which the provincial board is maintaining a launch or other vessel for the transportation of its officers and for other public purposes the provincial board is authorized to transport nonofficial passengers at reasonable rates of fare from one place in the province to another: Provided, however, That nonofficial passengers shall be received only when consistent with the carriage of all official passengers.
Section 2. The provincial board shall adopt regulations to govern the officers in charge of the launch or other vessel in respect to the transportation of nonofficial passengers and fix the charge for such carriage: Provided, however, That the business thus authorized to be done by the provincial board with its official launch shall be so arranged as not to compete with regular commercial lines transporting passengers between points in the same province, it being the intent of this Act merely to permit the provincial board to supply transportation for the public where the same can not be otherwise obtained.
Section 3. All moneys received by virtue of this Act for the transportation on a launch or other vessel belonging to a provincial government shall be paid into the provincial treasury and shall be considered as provincial funds available for expenditure by the provincial board, as provided by law, for the general purposes of the provincial government.1a—àphi1
