Payment of such notes shall be secured by first mortgages on real estate in the Philippine Islands, and in no case shall such loans exceed sixty per cent of the actual value of said real estate, including the value of the permanent improvements thereon, such as buildings and machinery if the same form an integral part of the agricultural development: Provided, however, That whenever the Bank may deem it advisable, the mortgages shall contain a clause obliging the mortgagor to insure to their full value in the name of the National Bank such buildings and improvements. The due date of said mortgages shall not be less than one year from the date thereof, nor more than thirty years. The said mortgages may, by their terms, be made payable at one time or in installments: Provided, That when the due date of the mortgage is five years or more after the date of its execution, the principal and interest of the loan shall be made payable by its terms in equal installments of not more than one year each. Loans made by the National Bank on real estate security shall be made for the purpose of promoting agriculture. Applications for such loans shall be in writing and under oath, and shall contain, among other things:

""(a) A detailed description of the real estate;
""(b) An appraisal thereof at its reasonable market value;
""(c) A full statement of the purposes for which the loan is desired.1a—àphi1
