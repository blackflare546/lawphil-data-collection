No such company shall do business under the provisions of this Act within the Philippine Islands until it shall by a written power of attorney appoint some person residing at the city of Manila, Island of Luzon, upon whom may be served all lawful process against such company, and who shall be authorized to enter an appearance in its behalf. A copy of such power of attorney, duly certified and authenticate, shall be filed with the clerk of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, which copy, or a certified copy thereof, shall be legal evidence in all controversies arising under this Act. If any such agent shall be removed, resign, or die, become insane, or otherwise incapable of acting, it shall be the duty of such company to appoint another agent in his place as hereinbefore prescribed, and until such appointment shall have been made, or during the absence of any agent of such company from said city of Manila, service of process may be upon the clerk of said Supreme Court, with like effect as upon such agent appointed by the company.

Section 7. Any company which shall execute or guarantee any recognizance, stipulation, bond, or undertaking under the provisions of this Act shall be estopped in any proceeding to enforce the liability which it shall have assumed to incur, to deny its corporate power to execute or guarantee such instrument or assume such liability.

In actions to enforce the forfeiture in this section provided, service upon the attorney or agent specified in the second section, or, in lieu thereof, upon the clerk of the Supreme Court in the manner provided in said section, shall be sufficient service to bind the company.
