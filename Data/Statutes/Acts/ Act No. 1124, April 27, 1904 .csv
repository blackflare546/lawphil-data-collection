AN ACT TO PROVIDE MEDICAL ATTENDANCE ON CIVIL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES AT ISOLATED POINTS WHEN LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY.
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Commission, that:
Section 1. In any case where an officer or employee of the Insular Government or of a provincial government is ill at a point remote from a hospital under the control of the Insular or of a provincial government, and it appears to the satisfaction of the Civil Governor that medical attendance on such officer or employee is necessary to preserve his life, the Civil Governor may order any medical officer in the employ of the Insular or of a provincial government to attend such ill person and, if necessary, conduct him to the nearest hospital for treatment. In case the attending physician and surgeon of a hospital under the control of the Insular or of a provincial government is so ordered to give such medical attendance he may, if he shall deem it more advisable, designate in his stead for such duty a competent nurse in the employ of the Government. The actual and necessary traveling expenses of such physician or nurse shall be a proper charge against the contingent appropriations of the Bureau or hospital in which he is employed, and, if the patient is an employee of a provincial government, such traveling expenses may be made a proper charge against the provincial treasury. In no case shall this Act be construed to cover the traveling expenses or subsistence of such ill employee to or from a hospital, such expenses being a personal charge to be borne by him. This Act may be construed retroactively to cover such cases of traveling expenses as heroin provided for as may be specifically approved by the Civil Governor.1a—àphi1
