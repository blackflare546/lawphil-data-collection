In making this assessment the board of assessors shall take into consideration the sworn statement by the owners of property in the municipality herein before required to be filed but shall not be prevented thereby from considering other evidence on the subject.

Upon the day fixed in the posted notice the board shall meet and hear all complaints then or theretofore filed by persons against whom taxes have been assessed as owners of real estate and shall make and enter the decision upon its minutes; and if the board shall determine that injustice has been done or errors have been committed it shall have authority to amend the certificate on the back of the declaration of the property so affected.
