The provincial secretary shall act as secretary of the locust board without additional compensation. It shall be the duty of the locust board to enforce the provisions of this Act.
Section 2. In every province in which a plague of locusts is threatened or exists every able-bodied inhabitant, subject to such regulations and limitations as the board constituted under this Act may adopt, is hereby declared to be liable to service in suppressing the locust pest. The board is hereby empowered to issue regulations directing the conduct of the persons summoned for the purposes of this Act and to control their operations, either directly or through the municipal officers of the various municipalities who are hereby, in respect to the scope of this Act, made subordinates of the board hereby constituted. The regulations of the board may require that the inhabitants shall work en masse or in such force and in such manner as may be deemed by the board most efficacious to the end in view, or the board may require that each inhabitant subject to this Act shall collect a given quantity of locusts, fixing the amount thereof in ""gantas"" or ""cavanes"". It is hereby declared to be the intent of this Act to give the board hereby constituted full discretion in the manner of suppressing the locust pest.
Section 3. It shall be the duty of municipal councilors and of all other municipal officers upon the appearance of locusts within their respective barrios to bring the fact at once to the attention of the municipal president, whose duty it shall be to take the necessary steps prescribed by the regulations of the board hereby constituted and to bring the fact to the notice of the board through the provincial governor.
Section 4. Where any persons summoned under this Act to the public service herein required shall, by reason of their poverty, be unable to support themselves with food during their service, the board hereby constituted may authorize the municipality to furnish them with sufficient rice from the store of rice sent to the province by the Civil Governor and paid for from the ""Congressional relief fund,"" reporting at once to the Civil Governor, and by telegram where possible, the amount needed for such purpose.1a—àphi1

Every person liable under this Act to the lawful orders of the board hereby constituted who shall fail to comply with the same shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined or imprisoned, or both, in the discretion of the municipal president, in accordance with the regulations to be provided by the board: Provided, however, That the penalty shall not exceed in any case ten dollars' fine or ten days' imprisonment, or both.
Section 6. The moneys accruing from fines for violations of this Act shall constitute a special fund to he deposited with the municipal treasurer of the municipality in which such violation occurs for the purpose of being applied by him in payment for the hoppers or ""loctones"" turned over to him by such persons as have already fulfilled the requirements of the obligation imposed upon them by virtue of the provisions of section two of this Act. The price to be paid for this purpose shall also be determined and fixed in the regulations to be adopted by the hoard constituted under this Act.

The provincial supervisor or supervisor-treasurer of the province is required to take up such galvanized-iron sheets upon his property return and to duly account for the same.
