AN ACT APPROPRIATING THE SUM OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS, IN MONEY OF THE UNITED STATES, FOR EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE, SALE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF RICE TO INHABITANTS OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS IN THE DISCRETION OF THE CIVIL GOVERNOR.
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Commission, that:
Section 1. The sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, in money of the United States, is hereby appropriated, out of the fund of three million dollars appropriated by the Congress of the United States for the relief of distress in the Philippine Islands, for expenditure in the purchase of rice for the purpose of securing to the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands opportunity to purchase rice at reasonable prices and for the purpose of distributing rice gratuitously to those people who are suffering from lack of food and unable to pay for the same.
Section 2. The purchase of rice, authorized by section one hereof, shall be made by the Insular Purchasing Agent in such manner and quantities and at such prices and times as the Civil Governor may direct. The rice so purchased shall be distributed by sale at such prices and in such localities as the Civil Governor may direct, or shall be paid for by work on roads or other public improvements, or shall be distributed in emergencies gratuitously to starving people upon order of the Civil Governor: Provided, however, That it is the declared policy of the Commission to distribute rice gratuitously only in cases of sudden emergencies, and in all other cases of destitution to furnish rice in consideration of work done for the public. Where distribution of rice, either by sale or gratuitously, is made under the provisions of this Act for the inhabitants of any province, such rice shall be sent to the provincial supervisor of such province, by him to be distributed under the orders of the provincial board and the Civil Governor.
Section 3.1a—àphi1 When any of the rice purchased under this Act shall be sold by a provincial supervisor or supervisor-treasurer, as the case may be, the proceeds of the sale shall be paid into the provincial treasury upon order of the supervisor. The provincial treasurer or provincial supervisor-treasurer shall then account to the Insular Treasurer for all moneys thus received, and remit the same to the Insular Treasurer upon order of the Insular Auditor. When the rice shall be sold directly by the Insular Purchasing Agent, the proceeds of the sale shall be deposited in the Insular Treasury forthwith upon order of the Auditor. When the rice is distributed for work done or gratuitously, the supervisor shall keep, careful account of the rice thus distributed, and make report thereof to the Insular Auditor, including a statement of the work done for the rice distributed, with copy of the receipts received by him from the beneficiaries or from the presidents or other municipal officers, through whom such distribution is made. The accounting by the Insular Purchasing Agent and the provincial supervisors and treasurers under this Act shall be in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the Insular Auditor.
Section 4. The public good requiring the speedy enactment of this bill, the passage of the same is hereby expedited in accordance with section two of ""An Act proscribing the order of procedure by the Commission in the enactment of laws,"" passed September twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred.
Section 5. This Act shall take effect on its passage.
Enacted, June 1, 1903.
