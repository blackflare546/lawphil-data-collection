This five months' vacation shall be assigned to him by the Civil Governor, but shall always be fixed within a .period to include the regular court vacation. No leave shall accumulate from year to year to the judges under this Act, but the Governor may in his discretion postpone the extra three months' vacation from one year to the next if this is required by. public business, provided the judge shall have at least two such vacations in six years: Provided, however, That, for the period prior to the going into effect of this Act any judge may have the benefit of the leave that would then have accrued to him under the provisions of Act Numbered Eighty and its amendments, had those provisions been applicable to him by express terms, should he so elect, after the passage of this Act; but he shall not be entitled to the benefits of the provisions accruing under Act Numbered Eighty and its amendments and likewise to those accruing under the provisions of this Act. During the court vacations and during the leave of absence for live months granted every third year. I he judges a fleeted thereby and enjoying the same shall draw full pay. The right to a leave of absence for five months shall accrue to all judges who have served as judges three years in the Islands and who have not during that time visited the United States. This provision shall be retroactive.
