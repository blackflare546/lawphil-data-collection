""In the case of a nonresident, there shall be deducted from the value of that part of his gross estate which at the time of his death is situated in the Philippine Islands that proportion of the deductions specified in the preceding paragraph which the value of such part bears to the value of his entire gross estate, wherever situated, but in no case shall the amount so deducted exceed ten per centum of the value of that part of his gross estate which at the time of his death is situated in the Philippine Islands: Provided, That no deduction shall be allowed in the case of a non­resident unless the executors or administrators or the heirs, as the case may be, furnish the Collector of Internal Revenue with a list of the gross estate not situated in the Philippine Islands and its corresponding value at the time of his death.""

""(a) In the second and third cases of the next preceding section, the return must be filed before entrance into possession of the property and the tax paid within twenty days after service of notice of assessment by the Collector of Internal Revenue.
""(b) In other cases, within six months after the death of the predecessor, and the tax paid within twenty days after service of notice of assessment; but if judicial testamentary or intestate proceedings shall be instituted prior to the expiration of said period, the return must be filed by the executor or administrator within thirty days after the date of approval by the court of the schedule of partition and the tax paid within twenty days after service of assessment notice by the Collector of Internal Revenue.

""If the tax is not paid within the time hereinbefore prescribed, there shall be added to the tax a surcharge of twenty-five per centum and an interest at the rate of twelve per centum per annum to be counted from the date of delinquency, or in case the return is not filed in due time, from the date when it should have been filed, until paid, both surcharge and interest to form a part of the tax.
