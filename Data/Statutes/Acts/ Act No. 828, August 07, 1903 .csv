Section 2. The Insular Purchasing Agent may consign to provincial boards for sale upon proper requisition such number of said carabao or other draft animals as may be required by the board and authorized by resolution of the Commission.
Section 3. The Insular Purchasing Agent and provincial boards to which consignments of carabao and other draft animals may be made in accordance with section two of this Act are hereby authorized to sell such animals at public auction or in such other manner as may be authorized by resolution of the Commission to farmers and and other persons requiring and needing them to perform work or labor on the property of the buyers or on property leased, hired, or occupied by them, or in or about a business owned, managed, or conducted by them. In case of the sale of cattle under this Act a certificate of purchase of the cattle, with the proper descriptions, shall be issued to such purchaser of such cattle by the Insular Purchasing Agent or the provincial treasurer for the provincial board, in the form and containing details to be set forth in regulations of the Civil Governor to accord, so far as may be, with certificates of purchase required by law for private sales of carabao: Provided, however, That no stamp for such sale shall be required.
Section 4. Where practicable, reasonable notice of all sales of carabao and other draft animals shall be given by the Insular Purchasing Agent or the provincial board, as the case may be, and if at the time and place of sale more than one purchaser is present the privilege of choice shall be put up at auction and awarded to the person bidding the highest sum therefor, in addition to the minimum price for each carabao purchased, which minimum price is hereby fixed at seventy pesos, Philippines currency, for cash sales, and ninety-three pesos, Philippines currency, for part cash and part credit sales as hereafter defined, or the equivalent of these prices in Mexican or Spanish-Filipino currency at the official rate.

A purchaser or his agent violating the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred Philippine pesos or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment as to the court may seem just.
