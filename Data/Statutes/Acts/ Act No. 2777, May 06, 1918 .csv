Section 2. For the purposes of this Act, the Director of Lands shall, within one year from and after the date on which the same takes effect, determine the parcel or parcels of land within such reservations concerning which no claim has been filed or concerning which claims have been filed after the expiration of the time limit fixed therefor, and which have for this reason been declared, or are about to be declared, or may be declared, to be land of the public domain, and upon having determined the same, he shall so certify to the proper Court of First Instance and such certificate shall serve and be considered as a notice to said court for the reopening of the judicial proceedings provided for in the said section of Act Numbered Nine hundred and twenty-six.ℒαwρhi৷
