By authority of the President of the United States, be it enacted by the United States Philippine Commission, that:
Whereas the people of Capiz and of that part of Ambos Camarines known as Camarines Sur, and of Iloilo, are threatened with starvation because of the cattle disease which has carried off ninety per cent of the cattle and largely interfered with the raising, of the rice in these provinces, which furnishes the chief support of the people thereof; and
Whereas it is possible by the construction of much-needed roads in the pueblos of these provinces where the suffering and liability to starvation are greatest, to relieve the people from hunger and want until conditions shall be improved. Now, therefore:
Section 1. The provincial boards of the Provinces of Capiz, Ambos Camarines, and Iloilo are each hereby authorized, by resolution, to borrow from the Insular Government the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, in currency of the United States, or any part thereof, to be expended under the supervision of the respective provincial boards, by the respective provincial supervisors, upon the construction of needed roads in those parts of the provinces in which the employment given by such construction, and the wages paid for the work thereunder, will relieve the people of the provinces from the danger of starvation. The amounts borrowed hereunder shall be spent for no other purpose than that stated herein. The sums thus borrowed shall be returned to the Insular Treasury by the respective provincial boards in yearly installments of one-fifth of the total amount, the first installments to be due two years from the respective dates of the passage of the resolutions herein authorized by the provincial boards. These loans shall be without interest.
Section 2. Such loans shall be made to the three provinces above-named to the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars each, or any less sum to be fixed in the resolution of acceptance by the board of the provinces, upon the receipt of the resolution of the provincial board of each province, which shall be accompanied by a general plan and estimate of the provincial supervisor for the work to be performed, showing the towns between which the roads are to be constructed, the character of the roads, and the extent thereof. The amount loaned shall be paid to the provincial treasurer and receipted for by him and shall be by him disbursed upon orders of the provincial board as in other cases.1a—àphi1
