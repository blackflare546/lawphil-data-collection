Timber thus cut without license shall not be sold nor shall it be exported from the province where cut, except as hereinafter authorized: Provided, That the Director of Forestry, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, may set aside for the use of the inhabitants of any municipality, township, or settlement a suitable tract of forest, which shall be known as a communal forest, and the privilege of cutting, taking, or hiring cut or taken from the public forest, without license and free of charge, such timber, other than timber of the first group, and such firewood, resins, other forest products, and stone or earth, as any resident of the municipality may require for house building, fencing, boat building, or other personal use of himself, or his family, shall then be exercised only within the communal forest thus set aside: Provided further. That when the area of a municipality, township, or settlement is so extremely large and its barrios are so remote from one another that the inhabitants thereof are deprived, on account of their distance from the communal forest, from the enjoyment of the benefits of this Act, the Director of Forestry, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, shall, upon application by the municipality, township, or settlement, set aside two suitable tracts of forest as communal forest, from which said inhabitants may cut, take, or hire cut or taken, without license and free of charge, such timber, other than timber of the first group, as they may require for their personal use.  Such communal forest shall be on lands more suitable for forestry than for agriculture.  They shall be administered by the Director of Forestry, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, in such a way as to assure the people having rights therein of a continued supply of forest products necessary for their home use, and to this end the Director of Forestry may prescribe the species and sizes of trees that may be cut and the manner of removal of such trees or other forest is products, stone, or earth.
