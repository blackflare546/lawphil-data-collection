AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION BEFORE THE SUSPENSION, REVOCATION OR CANCELLATION OF ANY CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE GRANTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:
Section 1. Subsection (i) of section fifteen of Act Numbered Thirty-one hundred and eight, by Act Numbered Thirty-four hundred and eighteen, is hereby amended to read as follows:
""(i) With the exception of public services for the operation of vessels within the Philippine Islands, no public service as herein defined shall operate in the Philippine Islands without having first secured from the Commission a certificate, which shall be known as certificate of public convenience, to the effect that the operation of said public service and the authorization to do business will promote the public interests in a proper and suitable manner. Every public service existing on the date of the approval of this Act shall pay the fees herein prescribed for the issuance of the proper certificate of public convenience or public necessity and convenience, as the case may be, in the same manner as said fees shall be payable by any new public service subject to the provisions of this Act, within sixty days from the date of the approval of this Act: Provided, however, That in the case of a public service for the operation of whose business it is necessary to obtain a franchise from either a municipal government, or a provincial government, under the provisions of Act Numbered Six hundred and sixty-seven, as amended by Act Numbered Ten hundred and twenty-two, or from the Philippine Legislature, such public service shall secure a certificate to be known as certificate of public necessity and convenience, as required by section twenty-two of this Act. The duty to secure such certificates of public convenience or certificates of public necessity and convenience by public services or to pay the fees herein prescribed by public services already existing is of a mandatory character and noncompliance herewith may, in the judgment of the Public Service Commission, be sufficient ground for the revocation and cancellation of any vested right and for the imposition of the penalty provided for in this Act.1a—àphi1
""However, no certificate of public convenience issued in accordance with law shall be suspended, revoked or cancelled without giving the interested party an opportunity to be heard directly by the Public Service Commission.""
Section 2. All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions hereof are hereby repealed.
Section 3. This Act shall take effect on its approval.
Approved, November 14, 1931.
