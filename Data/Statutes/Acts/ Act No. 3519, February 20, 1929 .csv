""The Bank Commissioner and the examiners of the Bureau of Banking are hereby authorized to administer oaths to any director, officer, or employee of any banking institution and to compel the presentation of all books, documents, papers or records necessary in his or their judgment to ascertain the facts relative to the true condition of any banking institution.

""Section 1641. Distribution of assets.-In the case of the liquidation of a bank or banking institution, after payment of the costs of the proceedings, including reasonable expenses, commissions and fees of the Bank Commissioner, to be allowed by the court, the Bank Commissioner shall pay the debts of the institution, under decree of the court in the order of their legal priority.
