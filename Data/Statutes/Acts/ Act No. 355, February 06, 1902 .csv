Section 54. They shall seize all goods imported or removed in violation of law and shall not permit any goods to be removed from the landing places thereof until they have been properly weighed, gauged, or measured, and shall require persons charged with the unlading of goods to properly separate, assort, and arrange the goods on their wharves for the convenience of customs weighers, gangers, measurers, and markers.
Section 55. Discharging inspectors shall not allow ballast, cargo, or coal to be taken on board their vessels while discharging, except on a lading permit; and where such permits are granted, inspectors shall report whenever the execution of the same is attended with danger to the revenue.
Section 56. They shall not unlade or deliver goods direct from a foreign port before the hour of sunrise or after the hour of sunset, except upon a special permit issued to the vessel whose discharge by night is desired.

Before reporting their vessel as fully discharged they shall make careful personal examination of all parts of such vessel.
WEIGHERS.
Section 63 Weighers shall be assigned to duty by surveyors. At ports where there is but one weigher, the assistant weighers shall be assigned to duty by him. He shall be held responsible for the correct and efficient discharge of their duties, and shall report to the surveyor any misconduct or neglect of duty on the part of any customs officer or employee.
Weighers are required to be at the places to which they are assigned whenever weighable goods are being handled from vessels discharging cargo from foreign port. They are required to inspect and take copies of all permits in the hands of discharging inspectors of vessels, whenever the collectors have, by designating articles named in the permits, directed the said articles to be weighed; and weighers are required to have and exercise a personal supervision of the weighing of such merchandise. They must not absent themselves from their office or harbor district during the hours of business unless by permission, nor shall they allow any other than an assistant weigher to take weights or to handle the beam.
Section 61. Each weigher is required to have his weighing instruments tested and compared with the official standard at least twice a year, on or as soon after the first day of January and the first clay of July as possible, and to have the same tested as often as may be necessary to keep the same in conformity with the official standard.
Section 65. Weighers will be furnished by surveyors with proper blank dock hooks, in which they shall daily make a true and correct entry of goods weighed, specifying the date the weighing was performed. These books must be so kept that they will contain all the specifications necessary to a perfect account of the merchandise weighed. The weigher should first copy the order or permit in the hook and then proceed in all cases where the merchandise is required to he weighed by numbers, to enter the number and weight of each separate package weighed by him. The weigher must add the weights slated in each column of his book and give the gross weight and the net weight of each lot as returned by him, and at the end of all the entries the total gross weights must be recapitulated by him. The book must be indorsed on the outside with the name of the vessel, the date the return was filed in the surveyor's office, and the weigher's signature.
Whenever required by the collector for the purpose of liquidation, the dock book shall be delivered to him for inspection and verification.
Section 66. In order to facilitate the prompt liquidation of duties, weighers are required to make a special return of the weight of the articles embraced in each permit or order as soon as the same shall have been ascertained. Weighers shall file their completed books of weights within six days after the vessel has been discharged, in the surveyor's office as public records. A separate book shall be kept for the cargo of each vessel.
Section 67. Before weighing any merchandise the weigher must see that the beam is accurately balanced. As correctness of weights depends very much upon the accuracy of the poise, the beam should always be kept clean and frequently tested will the standard. A fairly even beam indicates the weight, but as in weighing merchandise it seldom happens that the beam will stand at an exact poise, but will go either above or below an even beam, the weight shall be taken on the rising beam. Weighers are required to mark the weight on each single package weighed.
Section 68. When a return has been once made by a weigher, it must not be amended or changed except by permission of the surveyor. The amended return must state why the amendment is made, and be checked or signed by the weigher before it is presented to the surveyor for his approval. The original figures shall be canceled by crossmarks and the amendment added, so as to show both records. When an amendment to a return is allowed, the weigher must correct his dock book in accordance with the amended return. 
Section 69. From every invoice of railroad iron or steel, or any other similar goods, a sufficient number of bars of equal length shall be weighed in order to ascertain the average weight thereof, such number of bars to be counted, and the proper returns made as in the ease of any other merchandise but if the weight as shown by the returns of the weigher does not vary more than five per cent from that stated in the invoice, the entry shall be liquidated at the invoice weight. If the interested party does not accept the increase in weight arising from the above method of appraisal, the entire consignment may be weighed, but if he does accept the proposed increase in weight the appraisement may be considered as ended.
Section 70. Whenever a permit or order directs that goods be weighed and a special return be made therefor, the weigher shall weigh the goods designated and make a return separate and distinct from any other without delay. If the merchandise has been shipped before the order to weigh is received by the weigher, he shall indorse such fact on the back of the order and return it to the surveyor. Returns of the weighing of a cargo must be made to the collector within six days after the vessel has been discharged. Certificates or copies of weights shall be furnished by the surveyor at ports where there is such an officer, elsewhere by the collector.

CHAPTER XI.ENTRY OF IMPORTED MERCHANDISE.
Section 157. All imported merchandise must be entered at the custom-house of the port of arrival, either for consumption or in bond, by the person holding the bill of lading which names him as the consignee, or a bill of lading indorsed to his order by the consignee named therein. A banker holding a bill of lading as security for advances of money may transfer the same, by indorsement, to the actual importer. Underwriters shall be recognized as consignees of merchandise abandoned to them, and salvors as consignees of merchandise found by them derelict at sea.
A consignee holding a bill of lading drawn to his order or assigns may transfer the same to any person who can lawfully make the required declarations on entry, and the holder of a bill of lading drawn in blank ""to order,"" and indorsed by the shipper or consignor, may make entry of the merchandise specified therein upon duly indorsing the same. 
Section 158. Merchandise of which entry is not perfected at the expiration of the period allowed by law for the discharge of cargo of the importing vessel may be taken possession of by the collector as unclaimed, and placed in store to be disposed of according to law.
Unless otherwise specially provided by law, duties shall accrue upon imported merchandise on arrival of the importing vessel within the jurisdictional waters of a port of entry with intent to unlade.
Section 159. Entries in bond may be made for placing the merchandise in warehouse, or for its constructive warehousing and immediate transportation to other ports of the Archipelago without appraisement, or for constructive warehousing and immediate exportation; and merchandise in warehouse may be withdrawn either for consumption, exportation, or for transportation to another port of the Archipelago. Two of these objects may, in some cases, be combined in one withdrawal. Whenever goods are so transported in bond without appraisement they must be consigned to the care of the collector at the port of destination, who will allow entry to be made at his port by the actual consignee.
Section 160. Entries shall be in duplicate, in writing, according to prescribed form, and shall be signed by the importer or his duly authorized agent, and shall declare the names of the importing vessel and her master, her port of departure and date of arrival, the number and marks of packages, or the quantity, if in bulk, and the nature of the merchandise contained therein; also the value thereof as set forth in an invoice to be presented in duplicate with the entry, with all costs incidental to placing the same, packed, ready for shipment to the Philippine Islands.
Section 161. The description on the entry of the merchandise shall be in terms of tariff laws and in the currency of the invoice, and the values of the several classes of merchandise shall be separately placed under their respective rates of duty, as claimed by the importer, and the totals of each class duly shown. The rates of duty thus stated oil the entry shall be advisory only, and shall not govern the collector's classification for the assessment of duty.
Section 162. Entries of merchandise covered by one invoice may be made simultaneously for both consumption and warehouse. Where an intent to export the merchandise is shown by the bill of lading and invoice, the whole or a part of an invoice (not less than one package) may be entered for ""warehouse and immediate exportation."" In this case the collector may designate the vessel in which the merchandise is laden as constructively a ""warehouse,"" in order to facilitate the direct transfer of the goods to the exporting vessel. The same procedure may apply to goods entered for ""warehouse and immediate transportation. ""
Merchandise received at any port from another port of the Archipelago on an entry for ""immediate transportation without appraisement"" may be entered at the port of delivery either for consumption or warehouse.
Section 163. No merchandise over one hundred dollars in value, except personal effects accompanying a passenger, shall be admitted to entry without the production of the invoice thereof, unless the importer shall make application under oath showing, to the satisfaction of the collector, that it is impracticable to produce such invoice. This affidavit shall be accompanied by a statement of value of pro forma invoice, which shall be verified by declaration under oath.
Section 164. All invoices of imported merchandise shall be made out in the currency of the place or country from whence the importation shall be made or if purchased, in the currency actually paid therefor shall contain a correct description of such merchandise, with true numbers, gross weights, and net weights in the terms of the tariff, or quantities as the assessment of duty may require, and shall be made in duplicate and signed by the person owning or shipping the same, or his duly authorized agent. In case of merchandise transported in bond, one of said invoices shall be retained by the collector at the port of original entry, and the other shall be forwarded with the entry to the collector at the port of destination.
Section 165. Every invoice must represent a distinct shipment to one consignee or firm of consignees by one vessel. If by reason of accident or short shipment, a portion thereof should fail to arrive, an extract from the original invoice, certified to by the collector, may be used for entering the remaining packages. 
Section 166. Invoices must be made out on firm and durable paper, in a legible manner, on one side of the paper only, and with ink not liable to fade, and must contain the quantities of the merchandise in weights and measures of the country of exportation.

SS ....................................., of ...................................., being duly sworn, says that he is a member (or manager) of the firm (or corporation) of ..................................., the identical person .............................. mentioned in the foregoing entry, and that the said entry contains the true numbers, weights, and quantities according to the tariff, and a just and true account, classification, and description of all the goods, wares, and merchandise contained in the parcels described in the said entry, as he verily believes; that according to the best of his knowledge and belief there is no invoice or bill of lading other than those now produced by him, and that they are in the state in which he actually received them, and that nothing has been by him or to his knowledge concealed or suppressed whereby the Government may be defrauded of the duty lawfully due on said goods, wares, and merchandise. And this deponent further says that the invoices and entry which he now presents contain, as to such goods, wares, and merchandise as are dutiable according to the value thereof, a just and faithful account of the actual cost and actual market value thereof in the usual wholesale quantity, including the cost of all packing, packages, and receptacles therefor, and all other costs incident to placing the said goods, wares, and merchandise in condition ready packed for shipment to the Philippine Islands.

Each such indorsement shall be canceled by the liquidation of the entry to which it relates.
Section 172. Except as provided in the two sections last preceding, no imported dutiable merchandise shall be delivered to the importer until after examination of the designated packages, the proper return of weight, gauge, or measure, the liquidation of the entry thereupon, and the full payment or security of the duties so ascertained.

The date of the invoices will indicate the value of the money, but the reduction of insular or local currency of the United States shall be at the ratio fixed for the current quarter by the Civil Governor in accordance with law.
Section 175. When the standard value of a foreign coin has not been thus proclaimed, an invoice expressed in such coin must be accompanied by a consular certificate showing its value in standard gold dollars of the United States.

CHAPTER XXIX.ENTRANCE OF VESSELS THROUGH STRESS OF WEATHER.
Section 357. Whenever a vessel from a foreign port is compelled by stress of weather or other necessity to put into any other port than that of her destination, the master, together with the person next in command, within twenty-four hours after her arrival, shall make protest in the usual form, upon oath before a duly authorized per­son, setting forth the causes or circumstances of such necessity. This protest, if not made before the collector, must be produced to him, and a copy thereof lodged with him.
The master of such vessel shall make report to the collector within forty-eight hours after her arrival and if it appears to the collector by the certificate of the surveyor of the port, or, if there be no such officer, by the certificate of two reputable merchants, to be named by the collector, that it is necessary to unlade the vessel, the collector shall grant a permit and detail an inspector to supervise the unlading; and the merchandise so unladen shall be stored under custody of the collector.
At the request of the master of the vessel, or of the owner thereof, the collector may grant permission to enter and pay the duties on and dispose of such part of the cargo as may be of perishable nature or as may be necessary to defray the expenses attending the vessel. And if the delivery of the cargo do not agree with the master's report, and the difference be not satisfactorily explained, the master shall become subject to the penalties provided, in the case of ordinary importations.

Section 360. Customs inspectors, in cases of suspected fraud, are authorized to detain merchandise and have it conducted to the nearest custom-house, until its legitimate importation has been proved.
CHAPTER XXXI.DERELICT AND WRECKED MERCHANDISE.
Section 361. Merchandise picked up at sea, derelict or taken from a wreck, is prima facie dutiable. If claimed to be of Philippine production, and consequently free, proof must be adduced as in ordinary cases of reimportation of merchandise. Foreign merchandise landed from a vessel in distress is dutiable if sold or disposed of in the Philippine Islands.
Before any merchandise which has been taken from a recent g wreck shall be admitted to entry, the same shall be appraised, and the owner or importer shall have the same right of appeal as in other cases.
No part of a vessel entitled to engage in the coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands, nor any of her equipments, wrecked either in Philippine or foreign waters, is to be regarded as ""goods, wares, or merchandise. ""
All merchandise picked up at sea, derelict, or recovered from abandoned wrecks, shall be taken possession of in the port or district where it shall first arrive, and be retained in the custody of the collector as unclaimed. If not claimed and entered by the owner on due proof of ownership, by the underwriters in case of abandonment, to them, or by the salvors in the absence of adverse claims, it will be subject to sale for the duties in the usual manner. Salvors have an uncertain interest in the goods saved, dependent upon the decree of a competent tribunal, and also have a presumptive right to merchandise saved by them from abandoned wrecks. The collectors will therefore permit salvors to make entry of derelict or wrecked goods in either contingency. If the merchandise be libeled for salvage, the collector shall notify the salvors of the claim of the Government of the Philippine Archipelago for duties, and will intervene for the same. When such goods are brought into port by lighters or other craft each such vessel must make entry by manifest of her cargo.
Section 362. When vessels are wrecked in the waters of the Philippine Achipelago application should be made to the collector of customs by the original owners or consignees of the cargo, or by the underwriters, in case of abandonment to them, for permission to forward the goods saved from the wreck to the ports of destination in other conveyances, without entry at the custom-house in the district in which such merchandise was cast ashore or unladen. On receipt of such permission the merchandise may be so forwarded, with particular manifests thereof duly certified by the customs officer in charge of the goods.
Section 363. Whenever any vessel entitled to engage in the coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands, has sustained or caused any accident involving loss of life, material loss of property, or serious injury to any person, or has received any damage affecting her sea­worthiness or her efficiency, the managing owner, agent, or master of such vessel shall, within five days, send, by letter, to the collector of the district within which such vessel belongs, or of that within which such accident or damage occurred, a report thereof, signed by such owner, agent, or master, stating the name of the vessel, the port to which she belongs, and the place whore she was, the nature and probable occasion of the casualty, the number and names of those lost, and the estimated amount of loss or damage to the vessel or cargo; and shall furnish such other information as shall be called for; and if he neglects to comply with the foregoing requirements after a reasonable time, he shall incur a penalty of one hundred dollars. And whenever the managing owner or agent of any vessel in the Philippine Archipelago has reason to apprehend that such vessel has been lost, he shall promptly send notice in writing to the collector of the port to which said vessel belonged of such loss and the probable occasion therefor stating the name of the vessel and the names of all persons on board, so far as the same can be ascertained, and shall furnish, upon request of the collector, such additional information as shall be required; and if he neglect to comply with the above requirements within a reasonable time he shall incur a penalty of one hundred dollars.
If there be no custom-house at the point where the vessel is wrecked, the coast guard or customs official nearest the scene of the wreck shall render all possible aid in saving the crew and cargo of the vessel, taking charge of the merchandise saved and giving im­mediate notice to the nearest custom-house.
In order to prevent any attempt to defraud the revenue, the collector shall be represented at the saving of the cargo by customs inspectors detailed for that purpose, who shall examine and countersign the inventory made of such cargo, receiving an authorized copy of the same and the keys to the warehouse's in which the goods are stored.
If the merchandise saved is not damaged, and the interested parties should make application for its appraisal, they shall send a declaration of the same, in duplicate, to the custom-house; and the proper examination and dispatch shall take place in the regular form established by these regulations.
The same proceedings shall be followed if it should be decided to enter a part of the merchandise for bonded warehouse.
Section 364. If the owner of the vessel wishes to export the remains of the wreck, he may be permitted to do so upon proper examination and inspection.
The remains of a wrecked vessel shall be considered to be not only the hull and rigging of the same, but also all ship's stores and articles of equipment, such as sails, ropes, chains, anchors, and so forth.
Section 365. If it is desired to refit the vessel for navigation, the following proceedings shall be had:

1. The owner of the vessel, if the same has not been sold, or the person acquiring it in the event of its sale, shall give official notice in writing to the collector of customs.
2. When the vessel is ready to sail the interested party shall inform the collector of customs, stating whether he wishes to reexport the vessel or have it placed under a certificate of protection.
3. In the latter case the collector shall order its appraisal and measurement made in the proper legal form.

CHAPTER XXXII.LIENS FOR FREIGHT OR LIGHTERAGE
Section 366. Whenever the collector shall be duly notified in writing of a lien for freight or lighterage upon any imported merchandise in his custody, he shall refuse the delivery of such merchandise until satisfied that the freight or lighterage thereon has been paid or secured. The rights of the Government shall not be impaired, nor shall it be liable for any losses incurred by such refusal.
Freight or lighterage liens shall be paid from the proceeds of any sale of seized or unclaimed merchandise made by the collector, after the demands of the Government have been satisfied, in the same milliner as other charges and expenses are paid which are authorized by law.
If the amount of freight or lighterage depends upon the quantity or weight of the merchandise imported, and there is a disagreement between parties filing the lien and the importer as to the sum due, the collector may deliver the merchandise upon payment of the freight or lighterage due on the quantity or weight actually landed, is shown by the returns of the proper officer or otherwise to his satisfaction.
Section 367. The Insular Collector shall, by regulation, provide for expediting the entry, examination, and delivery of parcel packages and special-delivery packages imported by a common carrier containing articles not regular merchandise and not intended for sale and not exceeding one hundred dollars in value in any package intended for one person.
Section 368. All articles of foreign manufacture, such as are usually or ordinarily marked, stamped, branded, or labeled, and all packages containing such or other imported articles, must respectively be plainly marked, stamped, branded, or labeled in legible words in a conspicuous place, so as to indicate the country of their origin and the quantity of their contents; and until so marked, stamped, branded, or labeled they shall not be delivered to the importer. Should any article of imported merchandise be marked, stamped, branded, or labeled so as to indicate a quantity, number, or measurement not actually contained in such article, no delivery of the same shall he made to the importer until the mark, stamp, brand, or label, as the case may be, shall be changed so as to conform to the facts of the case.
Section 369. The Insular Collector shall prescribe regulations respecting the entrance of merchandise which by law shall be entitled a free entry subject to condition, or subject to the ascertainment or proof of certain facts respecting the same, or the entry of goods or articles imported for the United States or for the Government of the Philippine Islands.

Importation by sea begins with the moment the importing vessel enters the jurisdictional waters of a port of entry with intention to unlade therein, and is not completed until the duties due upon the merchandise have been paid or secured to be paid and the legal permit for withdrawal shall have been granted, or, in case said merchandise is free of duty, until it has legally left the jurisdiction of the customs.
Section 399. Where goods and wares consigned to a port in the Philippine Archipelago are landed in error at a different port in the Philippine Archipelago, and the collector at the original port of landing of such merchandise, and so forth, on investigation is convinced by the manifest and other evidence of such error, he may permit the reshipment of said merchandise, and so forth, to its proper destination under transportation bond and regulations governing same. Said bond may be executed by designated agent or owner of the merchandise, or agent of the vessel landing the merchandise, and so forth, in error. The merchandise shall be transshipped on another vessel of the same line, unless in the judgment of the collector this will cause unnecessary delay, in which case he may permit the transshipment by a vessel of any regular line.

Appendix B. 
ARTICLE XX.AMERICAN OR FOREIGN BUILT VESSELS TRANSFERRED ABROAD TO CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES.

341. Right to acquire property in foreign ships.-The right of citizens of the United States to acquire property in foreign ships has been held to be a natural right, independent of statutory law, and such property is as much entitled to protection by the United States as any other property of a citizen of the United States.
342. Treasury regulations.-Sea letters.-The existing general regulations of the Treasury Department under the customs and navigation laws (Customs Regulations, 1892) recognize the right of property in vessels of this character and declare them to be entitled to the protection of the authorities and to the flag of the United States, although no register, enrollment. license, or other marine document prescribed by the laws of the United States can lawfully be issued to such vessels whether they are American or foreign built. The former practice of issuing sea letters in the case of the purchase abroad of American or foreign vessels by citizens of the is United States is no longer authorized. Nevertheless, though the issuing of sea letters to such ships is not now authorized, yet there would seem to be no good reason upon the face of our present legislation why the Department of State should not resume the practice, in case the United States should be a neutral in a war between maritime powers, if it should deem such letters more protective in their character than consular or customs certificates of sale. 
343. Record of bill of sale, certificate, and so forth.-In view of existing regulations, and to enable the owners of a vessel so situated to protect their c rights, if molested or questioned, a consular officer, though forbidden by law to grant any marine document or certificate of ownership, may lawfully make record of the bill of sale in his office, authenticate its execution, and deliver to the purchaser a certificate to that effect; certifying, also that the owner is a citizen of the United States. Before granting such a certificate the consular officer will require the tonnage of the vessel to be duly ascertained, in pursuance of law, and insert the same in the description of the vessel in his certificate. (Form Numbered Thirty-five.) These facts thus authenticated, if the transfer is in good faith, entitle the vessel to protection as the lawful property of a citizen of the United States, and the authentication of the bill of sale and of citizenship will be prima facie proof of such good faith.
344. Consul's responsibility.-The authority of a consular officer to authenticate the transfer of a foreign vessel is wide in its effects and imposes great responsibility in making him, in the first instance at least, the sole judge of the good faith of the transaction. The question of the honesty and good faith of such a sale rises into the gravest importance in the event of a war between two or more powers in which the Government of the United States is a neutral. In such a war, experience justifies the expectation that the citizens or subjects of one or more of the belligerents will seek to protect their shipping by a transfer to a neutral flag. In some instances this may honestly be done; but the sales of the vessels of belligerents in apprehension of or in time of war are always, and properly, liable to suspicion, and they justify the strictest inquiry on the part of the belligerent who may thereby have been defrauded of his right to capture the enemy's property. The acceptance of the pretended ownership of a vessel under these circumstances may be very profitable, and the temptation to abuse his trust in such a case to which a consular officer is subjected may be too great for persons of ordinary integrity, discernment, and firmness to withstand. Instances are not wanting in which citizens of the United States who were wholly incapable, from their previous well-known condition and pursuits, of making such a purchase have appeared as owners under sales of this character, and have sought for them the protection of the Government.
345. Careful investigation enjoined.-It is the duty of a consular officer to use all available means, especially during the existence of a war to which this Government is not a part to satisfy himself that the sale of a vessel is made in good faith and without a fraudulent intent. A considerable discretion and responsibility rest upon him in the determination of the good faith of such transactions. It is not to be concluded that all such sales, even in time of peace, are honest and free from collusion or fraud. It is the duty of the consular officer to notice all circumstances that throw doubt on the good faith of the transaction or point to its fictitious character, and, if he is satisfied in this respect, to refuse to grant his certificate. On the other hand, he is not permitted to regard the mere fact of the sale of a vessel to a citizen of the United States as any evidence of fraud. The presumption must be otherwise, and. in the absence of any indication of dishonesty, a sale in the regular way. with the usual business formalities, is to be regarded as made in good faith.
346. Certificate, when to be issued.-When a consular officer shall have satisfied himself, after the investigation with which he is charged, that the sale of a vessel is not fictitious and is made in good faith, and that the purchaser is a citizen of the United States, it is his duty, when requested, to record the bill of sale in the consulate, and to deliver the original to the purchaser, with his certificate annexed thereto, according to Form Number Thirty-five. A copy of the bill of sale, together with any other papers belonging to the transfer, and of the consular certificate should be sent with­out delay to the Department of State, with a report of the facts and circumstances of the transaction.
347. Right to fly the flag-The privilege of carrying the flag of the United States is under the regulation of Congress, and it may have been the intention of that body that it should be used only by regularly documented vessels. No such intention, however, is found in any statute. And as a citizen is not prohibited from purchasing and employing abroad a foreign ship, it is regarded as reasonable and proper that he should be permitted to fly the flag of his country as an indication of ownership and for the due protection of his property. The practice of carrying the flag by such vessels is now established. The right to do so will not be questioned, and it is probable that it would be respected by the courts.
348. Disabilities of foreign-built vessels.-It should be understood that foreign-built vessels not registered, enrolled, or licensed under the laws of the United States, although wholly owned by citizens thereof, can not legally import goods, wares, or merchandise from foreign ports, and are not allowed in the coasting trade. (R.S., secs. 2497, 4311.) 
349. Forfeiture, and tonnage duties.-On arrival from a foreign port undocumented foreign-built vessels, if laden with goods, wares, or merchan­dise, may, with their cargoes, be subjected to forfeiture. (R. S., sec. 2497; see Tariff Act of 1894. sec. 15.) If in ballast only, or with passengers without cargo, they will be subject to a discriminating tonnage duty. (R. S., sec. 4219; 19 Stat. L., 250.) When in foreign ports they are also subject to tonnage and other consular fees from which regularly documented vessels are exempt. For instructions respecting the shipment and discharge and relief of seamen on vessels of this character, and the collection of extra wages, consular officers are referred to the several articles on these subjects.
