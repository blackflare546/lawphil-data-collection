AN ACT TO AMEND SECTION FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND TEN OF ACT NUMBERED TWENTY-SEVEN HUNDRED AND ELEVEN, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE REVISED ADMINISTRATIVE CODE.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:
Section 1. Section fifteen hundred and ten of Act Numbered Twenty-seven hundred and eleven, known as the Revised Administrative Code, is hereby amended so as to read as follows:
""Section 1510. Mode of measuring timber.-Except as herein below provided, all timber shall be measured and manifested in the round or squared, before being sawn or manufactured. The volume of all round timber shall be ascertained by multiplying the area of the small end by the length of the log, the diameter of the log to be measured exclusive of the bark; but if the end of a log is irregular, the average diameter shall be used, and in order to ascertain the volume of a log more than eight meters long, the diameter of the middle of said log, or the average of the diameters at both ends thereof shall be used as basis. If a log in the round, cut under license, is measured and manifested by forest officers, the Director of Forestry shall make due allowance for rot, cavities, or other natural detects; but from any decision of the Director of Forestry in this respect, an appeal shall lie to his Department Head, whose decision shall be final. The manifest of timber cut by licensees operating sawmills in or near the forest shall be attested by forest officers whenever practicable.
""Licensees with sawmills may measure their timber or cause or allow the same to be measured after it is sawn, provided they pay for each thousand board feet of lumber of the first and second groups a sum of not less than ten pesos, and of the other groups of not less than five.pesos, as forestry charges, in the discretion of the Director of forestry and after agreement with the same, with the approval of his Department Head. These agreements shall be for one year, but shall be subject to renewal.
""The volume of squared timber shall be ascertained by multiplying the average of the cross section measured by the length, to which thirty per centum shall be added for loss in squaring: Provided, however, That if squared timber cut under license, is measured and manifested by forest officers, the Director of Forestry shall make due allowance for rot, cavities, or other natural defects; but from any decision of the Director of Forestry in this respect, an appeal shall lie to his Department Head, whose decision shall be final. The privilege of manifesting timber after squaring shall, however, be granted only to licensees who have squared their logs in the forest with the ax and intend to take it to the market in this form.
""If sawn or otherwise manufactured timber is found which has not been manifested in accordance with the provisions hereof, the corresponding forest charges shall be assessed on twice the volume of the actual contents of such sawn or manufactured timber.1a—àphi1""
Section 2. This Act shall take effect on the date of its approval.
Approved, November 29, 1932.
