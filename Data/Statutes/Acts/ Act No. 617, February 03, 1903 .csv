Woolfe in accordance with his bid, and whereas his bid as accepted and filed was three hundred and forty-six dollars and seventy-five cents less than the next lowest bid, and whereas the balls as furnished were in fact, by reason of the mistake aforesaid, worth at least three hundred dollars more than the amount for which Henry D.
