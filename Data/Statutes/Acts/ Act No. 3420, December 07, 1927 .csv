" Act No. 3420, December 07, 1927 ",AN ACT GRANTING LOANS TO PROVINCES AND MUNICIPALITIES AND APPROPRIATING THE SUM OF THREE MILLION EIGHTY-NINE THOUSAND AND NINE HUNDRED PESOS FOR THIS PURPOSE.,"[ Act No. 3420, December 07, 1927 ]
AN ACT GRANTING LOANS TO PROVINCES AND MUNICIPALITIES AND APPROPRIATING THE SUM OF THREE MILLION EIGHTY-NINE THOUSAND AND NINE HUNDRED PESOS FOR THIS PURPOSE.
Whereas, the Loan Board created by Act Numbered Three thousand three hundred and thirty-five of the Philippine Legislature has approved certain loans to provinces and municipalities in accordance with the provisions of said Act;
Whereas, notwithstanding the approval of said loans the Insular Auditor has refused to authorize the release of the corresponding funds, because in his opinion the aforesaid Loan Board is illegally constituted in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in the case of Milton E. Springer et al. vs. The Government of the Philippine Islands, which case is now pending final decision before the Supreme Court of the United States;
Whereas, the public welfare requires the immediate release of said funds while awaiting the final determination by the courts as to the legality of the Loan Board, either as a result of the doctrine that may be established in the case of Milton E. Springer et al. vs. The Government of the Philippine Islands above referred to, or in an independent action that may be instituted by interested parties to compel the Insular Auditor to order the release of similar funds: Now, therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:
Section 1. The loan fund of three million five hundred thousand pesos appropriated and set aside by Act Numbered Three thousand three hundred and thirty-five is hereby reduced by the amount of three million twenty-four thousand and nine hundred pesos and said amount of three million twenty-four thousand and nine hundred pesos is hereby appropriated to be loaned to the following provinces and municipalities in the sums and for the purposes, respectively, herein specified, and under the terms, conditions and limitations as prescribed and approved by the Loan Board created by said Act Numbered Three thousand three hundred and thirty-five.
