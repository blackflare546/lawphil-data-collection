AN ACT TO CONFIRM CERTAIN RIGHTS AND FRANCHISES OF THE BANCO ESPAÑOL-FILIPINO AND TO AMEND ITS STATUTES.
Whereas the Banco Español-Filipino is a bank incorporated under a charter granted by the Kingdom of Spain conferring certain privileges and rights upon and bank, and especially that of the exclusive right of issuing and circulating notes of the bank to an amount equal to three times its capital stock, which was authorized to be three millions of pesos, equivalent to one million five hundred thousand dollars American currency; and
Whereas the bank has a paid-in capital of one million five hundred thousand pesos and claims to have in addition an unimpaired surplus of nine hundred thousand pesos; and
Whereas the bank has issued, and has now in circulation, its circulating notes amounting substantially to one million five hundred thousand pesos; and
Whereas the authorities of the bank contend that under the American sovereignty, by reason of the guaranty of the Treaty of Paris. they may exercise the same exclusive privilege with respect to circulating notes which was given them under the Spanish charter, and. therefore, that they may increase their capital stock to three million pesos and issue notes to the amount of nine million pesos; and
Whereas the representatives of the bank contend that the Philippine Government has violated the exclusive right of the bank above set forth in issuing so-called silver certificates secured by a deposit of similar pesos in the Treasury of the Islands; and
Whereas the Philippine Government, while recognizing as valid the present circulation, has heretofore denied the right of the Philippine- Bank under its charter to issue notes equal to three times its capital stock, on the ground that such note-issuing franchise was an exercise of sovereign power which was not transmitted or guaranteed by the Treaty of Paris, and has, therefore, imposed a prohibitory lax of twelve, per centum on any notes issued beyond the actual paid-in capital stock of the bank, because of its belief that the certain payment or redemption of such notes will not be properly secured under the provisions of the Spanish charter; and
Whereas the bank now threatens to test in court the validity of its franchise and the validity of the prohibitory tax, and relies upon the action of the Congress of the United States in confirming a similar charter granted to the Bank of Porto Rico; and
Whereas the Philippine government has no objection to the issue of circulating notes by this bank to the extent permitted by the Spanish charter, provided only that it shall not be exclusive, and that proper provision shall be made for securing the redemption or payment of such notes: Now, therefore,
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Commission, that:
Section 1. By way of compromise of the questions arising between the Banco Español-Filipino and the Philippine Government in respect to its charter, and the rights already conferred thereby, the Philippine Government, by virtue of the general powers conferred upon by under section seventy-four and other sections of the Act of Congress of July first, nineteen hundred and two, does hereby amend and confirm the Spanish charter of the Banco Español-Filipino as the same is hereinafter set forth: Provided, however, That nothing in this Act shall affect the validity of acts done and Fights and causes of action which have arisen under the existing statutes of said hank in its relations with individuals, firms, corporations and associations in the conduct of the banking business, except that validity is hereby given to all acts heretofore performed by the hank which would otherwise be legal, and whose validity might be questioned by reason of the failure of the bank to comply with its statutes in regard to the participation of the Government in the management of the bank: And provided further, That the charter and statutes of the bank hereinafter set forth by way of amendment and confirmation shall not take effect until the same shall be duly and in legal form accepted by the proper authorities of the bank representing the corporation.
