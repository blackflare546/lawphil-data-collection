GENERAL RULES.
CUSTOMS TREATMENT OF TEXTILES.
Rule 1. Number of threads and its ascertainment.-By the number of threads in a textile shall, unless otherwise stipulated, be meant the totality of all the threads comprised in the warp and weft in a square of six millimeters. The warp of textiles is to be considered as the totality of the threads which be longitudinally, whether they form the foundation of the same, or whether they have been added in order to form patterns or give the stuff more body. The weft shall be considered the totality of the threads which cross the warp of the textile, and combine the same conditions of helping to form patterns or to add to the body of the stuff. In order to determine, for customs treatment of textiles, the number of threads and the proportion in which the threads subject to the highest duty are found in the textile, the instruÂ­ment known as this ""thread counter"" shall be employed.
Should there be a doubt as to the ascertainment of the number of threads in a textile, owing to the textile being more closely woven in some parts than in others, the most closely woven part and the most loosely woven part shall be taken, and the average number of threads resulting from the two shall serve as a basis for levying duty.
When the nature of the tissue permits it, the thread shall always be counted on the obverse side of the stuff.
In all woolly or melton-like textiles, and generally in all textiles in which the threads have become indistinct, by carding or fulling, the threads shall be counted on the reverse side of the stuff by rasping or burning the hair when necessary.
In exceptional cases, where after these operations the ascertainment of the number of threads remains doubtful, a sufficient part of the textiles shall be unraveled.
Should this likewise be impossible, as for instance, in case of ready-made articles, the textile shall be subject to the highest duty of the group to which it belongs, and should the textile be mixed, it shall be dutiable according to the class in which the most highly taxed material entering into the mixture is comprised.

(c) Cotton textiles containing threads of silk or floss silk shall be dutiable according to the corresponding numbers of group three, Class Four, with the surtaxes established in each case:1 Provided, That the number of silk or floss silk threads, counted in the warp and weft, does not exceed one-fifth of the total number of threads composing the textile.
