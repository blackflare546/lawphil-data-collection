Section 12. (a) Every dealer in motor vehicles may, instead of registering separately each such motor vehicle owned by or controlled and used and operated in his business by him or by his employees or agents, make before the last working er day of February of each year, application for a general certificate of registration and general distinguishing number plates. Such application shall contain whatever information may be required by the Director of Public Works.

(b) The Director of Public Works or his deputies are hereby authorized in their discretion to require an applicant for a license as chauffeur to answer such further questions or to submit to such an examination touching his qualifications as chauffeur, as in the judgment of the Director of Public Works or his deputies, will best disclose the applicant's fitness and competency to operate motor vehicles.
(c) If after such examination, or without the same, the Director of Public Works or his deputies believe the applicant to possess the necessary qualifications and knowledge, they shall, upon the receipt of a fee of five pesos, issue to such applicant a license to operate as a chauffeur, motor vehicles of the kind, style, type, or make and power described in the application, until the last working day of February next following, or until such license is otherwise revoked.

(f) The Director of Public Works may suspend for a period not exceeding three (3) months or, after hearing, revoke any license issued under the provisions of this Act, and may order any such license to be delivered to him whenever he has reason to believe that the holder thereof is an improper or incompetent person to operate motor vehicles, or is operating or using a motor vehicle in, or as an accessory to, the practice or commission of any unlawful act, or so as to endanger the public; and the license so suspended or revoked shall not be reissued, unless upon investigation, the Director of Public Works decides that the operator may again safely be permitted to operate.
(g) Appeals from the decision of the Director of Public Works on the revocation of, or his refusal to renew, licenses under the provisions of this section may be taken to the Secretary of Commerce and Communications.

(b) The Director of Public Works or his deputies shall, in accord with rules to be determined and published by the Director of Public Works, fix the maximum carrying capacity in passengers or freight, of all motor vehicles with the exception of private passenger automobiles.

If the Director of Public Works or his deputies find any such motor vehicle to be dangerous, or capable of causing excessive damage to the public highways, bridges, or culverts, as aforesaid, he may refuse to register the same, or if the same be already registered he may upon twenty-four hours notice to the owner or operator, revoke such registration or suspend the force and operation thereof, until the defects, improper equipment, or other cause of insecurity, danger or excessive damage has been remedied. The action of the Director of Public Works or his deputies under this section shall be communicated in writing to the owner of the motor vehicle, and, if the motor vehicle be property of the Government or any of its political subdivisions, to the chief of the bureau or office to which the motor vehicle in question belongs.
