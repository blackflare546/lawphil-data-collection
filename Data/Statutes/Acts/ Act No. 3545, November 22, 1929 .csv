AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIANS FOR MINORS WHO ARE BENEFICIARIES OF THE UNITED STATES VETERANS' BUREAU.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:
Section 1. The judge of a Court of First Instance of each province may appoint guardians for the persons and estates, or either of them, of minors who are beneficiaries of the United States Veterans' Bureau and who are inhabitants or residents of the province or who reside without the Philippine Islands and have estates within the province. Such appointment may be made on petition of the Manila Branch of the United States Veterans' Bureau which is hereby authorized to ask that it be represented by the Bureau of Justice in all court proceedings involving such guardianship.
Before the appointment of a guardian takes effect, the judge must require of such guardian a bond to the minor in an amount not less than the sum then due and estimated to be payable by the said Bureau during the ensuing year.
Section 2. When the guardian presents his account to the court for settlement and allowance, a true and correct copy thereof shall be sent by the clerk of court to the Branch Office of the said Bureau in Manila within such time as shall, in the usual course of mail and travel, enable the said office to send a representative at the hearing of such account and make such objections as may be proper.
Section 3. The guardian shall be allowed a reasonable amount for his expenses incurred in the execution of his trust, such compensation for his services as the court in which his accounts are settled, deems just and reasonable, and also a commission upon all disbursements made by him: Provided, That such compensation and commission shall not exceed five per centum of the income of the ward during any year. In the event of extraordinary and unusual services rendered by such guardian, the court may, upon petition and after hearing thereon, authorize additional compensation therefor payable from the estate of the ward. Notice of such petition and hearing shall be given the Branch Office of the said Bureau in Manila in the manner provided above within such time as shall enable the said Office to send a representative at the hearing to make such objections as are proper.
Section 4. All the provisions of chapter twenty-seven of Act Numbered One hundred and ninety, in so far as they care not in conflict with the provisions hereof, shall apply to guardianship cases in which the wards are beneficiaries of the United States Veterans' Bureau.
Section 5. This Act shall take effect on its approval.1a—àphi1
