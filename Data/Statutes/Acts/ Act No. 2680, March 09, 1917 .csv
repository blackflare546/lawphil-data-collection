""Section 1. It shall hereafter be unlawful to import, sell or offer for sale any preparation, whether a simple substance or of compound substances, for the prevention, alleviation or cure of human ailments unless a qualitatively and quantitatively correct description of the principal drugs and toxic substances to which said preparation owes its action, expressed in the language, descriptions, and abbreviations used in the United States Pharmacopoeia or other accepted pharmacopoeias or furmularies, appears plainly and legibly upon the bottle, label or package immediately containing the preparation, in such wise that it shall reach the purchaser at each and every purchase. If any non-official drug or substance be used in the preparation, it shall be plainly described under its ordinary name or customary chemical term, and not by any fancy or proprietary name. It shall be the duty of every importer and manufacturer of any of the preparations above mentioned to forthwith furnish the Bureau of Science with a specimen of the preparation as it is to be exhibited for sale, and immediately upon the receipt thereof, the Bureau of Science shall analyze such preparation. In case the analysis made by the Bureau of Science shows the statement of the principal drugs and toxic substances on the bottle, label, or package to be false, fraudulent or incorrect to the extent of its being liable to mislead and cause injury, it shall be the duty of the Director of Science to inform the manufacturer or importer of the result and it shall thereafter be unlawful to have possession of such preparation except for re-exportation within such period of time as the Director of Science may designate: Provided, That in case the manufacturer or his agent shall not accept the result of the analysis made by the Bureau of Science, the Director of Science shall appoint a technical board, composed of a physician and two duly qualified pharmacists, which shall verify the accuracy of the formula questioned and the decision of which shall be final and unappealable.ℒαwρhi৷""
