AN ACT IMMEDIATELY TO REIMBURSE FROM THE INSULAR TREASURY THE TREASURIES OF PROVINCES WHICH HAVE SUFFERED LOSS THROUGH DEFALCATIONS OF THEIR BONDED OFFICIALS, PENDING RECOVERY OF AMOUNTS LOST ON THE OFFICIAL BONDS.
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Commission, that:
Section 1. In every case in which an organized province shall have suffered loss from its provincial funds through the defalcation of a provincial official bonded according to law, and the loss has been ascertained by the Auditor for the Islands, the Auditor is authorized and it shall be his duty to draw a warrant upon the Insular Treasurer for the amount thus ascertained to be lost, in favor of the provincial treasurer of the province where the loss has occurred, and indefinite appropriation is hereby made from the funds of the Insular treasury, not otherwise appropriated, to carry out the purposes of this section.
Section 2. When the amount of the loss described in the previous section, as ascertained from the Auditor, shall be recovered from the sureties on the official bond of the defaulting officer, the same shall be deposited in the Insular Treasury to the general credit of the Insular Government, to satisfy the obligation of the provincial government to the Insular Government created by the advance provided for in the first section hereof.
Section 3. The provisions of this Act shall not affect the form of the proceeding to collect the amount due on official bonds of provincial officers, the amount drawn under section one being regarded simply as an advance to the province on the security of the amount due on the official bond of the defaulting officer. The sureties on the official bonds of defaulting provincial officers shall only be acquitted of their liability by payment of the amounts due upon such bonds, upon the order of the Auditor, into the Insular Treasury.1a—àphi1
