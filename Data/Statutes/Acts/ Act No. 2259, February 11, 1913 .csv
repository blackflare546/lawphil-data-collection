By agreement between the co-owners or cotenants of lands included in the petition, lands not so included but held by said coowners or cotenants in the same manner and by the same tenure may, with the approval of the court, be included in the same partition proceedings, and in such cases the court may order a survey to be made of such lands.
Section 20. Before making the partition the commissioners shall take and subscribe an oath, before any officer authorized to administer oaths, that they will faithfully perform their duties as such commissioners, which oath shall be filed in court with the proceedings in the case.

Section 22. The order of the court effecting the partition shall state definitely, by adequate description, the particular portion of the estate which is apportioned to each party in interest and shall have the same force and effect as the final judgment in partition proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure.
Section 23. The guardian of minors and persons of unsound mind shall represent them in the partition proceedings authorized by this Act. Where no guardian is appointed, or where he fails to appear, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the minors or persons of unsound mind in the proceedings. Such guardian or guardian ad litem may, on behalf of his ward, and with the approval of the court, do and perform any act, matter, or thing respecting the partition of the estate, including amicable partition thereof, which such minor or person of unsound mind could do in the partition proceedings if he were of age or of sound mind.
Section 24. The proceedings in partition authorized by this Act shall be regarded as a part of the land registration case in connection with which the partition is ordered, and no special fees shall be charged by the clerk of the court for any service performed by him in such partition proceedings, but the compensation of the commissioners appointed and additional expenses incurred in connection with the partition, including the costs of additional surveys, may be taxed as costs in the case and apportioned among the parties interested in the partition to such an extent and in such a manner as the court may deem just and equitable. Upon the order taxing and apportioning such costs becoming final, an execution may issue therefor as in partition proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure unless the court direct that payment be made in installments as provided in section eighteen of this Act.

Any heir or devisee who, under a final judgment rendered in an action brought under this section, pays more than his proportionate share of the debts of the estate shall, with reference to the excess, be subrogated to the rights of the creditors under such judgment against each of the other heirs or devisees to the extent of their respective proportionate shares of the debts so paid by him: Provided further, That the provisions of this section shall not be construed to modify the provisions of existing law as to the order in which the heirs or devisees are liable to pay the debts of the deceased.
The judgment rendered in any action brought under this section by a creditor against the heirs or devisees of a deceased person shall, if favorable to the plaintiff, specify the maximum amount for which each heir or devisee shall be liable under such judgment.

Private surveyors shall not be authorized to make surveys for the Court of Land Registration unless they shall have passed either a civil service examination  examination by the Bureau of Lands for the purpose of determining their qualifications: Provided, however, That surveyors with an academic diploma issued by a duly established university, college, or school, who have practiced their profession in the Philippine Islands prior to June first, nineteen hundred and nine, excepting those who. having taken the examination herinafter provided, failed to pass the same, shall be authorized by the Director of Lands to make surveys for the Court of Land Registration without the necessity of passing the examination provided by this section. All surveys and plans made by private surveyors under said authorization shall be executed in strict accordance with the ""Manual of instructions of surveys to be verified by the Director of Lands for presentation to the Court of Land Registration"" issued by the Bureau of Lands: And provided further, That whenever it shall appear to the Director of Lands that there is doubt as to the accuracy of any plan or survey made under such authorization, such survey or plan shall be subject to verification in the manner provided in section sixty-six of Act Numbered Nine hundred and twenty-six, and if it appear that the survey is defective, incorrect, or substantially erroneous, the Director of Lands may thereupon withdraw authorization of said surveyor, subject to appeal by the surveyor, to be taken within five clays of receipt of notice of the withdrawal, to a committee composed of the Governor-General, the judge of the Court of Land Registration, and a duly authorized surveyor appointed by the Governor-General, the decision of which committee shall be final. If no appeal is taken as herein provided, or if the said committee shall approve the action of the Director of Lands in withdrawing from said surveyor the authorization to make surveys, such surveyor shall not be permitted to make surveys or plans for the Court of Land Registration without first having passed the examination provided for in this section. Pending appeal, the right of the surveyor to make surveys for the Court of Land Registration shall be suspended: And Provided further, That under the designation of surveyors with academic diploma shall be recognized all those who, with similar diplomas in the time of the Spanish Government, were considered as such surveyors or as entitled to practice the said profession.
Section 29. The short title of this Act shall be ""The Cadastral Act.""
