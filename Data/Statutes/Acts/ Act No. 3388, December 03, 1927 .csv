Such assignment shall be preferably made from land in the province of the community to be served; but if there be no such land conveniently situated for the use of such community, a communal forest or a communal pasture may be assigned for its use in a neighboring province.ℒαwρhi৷ If the public interests so require, the Director of Forestry may, with like approval, change the location or boundaries of a communal forest or a communal pasture, or dis-establish it altogether. A communal forest or a communal pasture, once established for such communal use, shall not be entered, sold or leased.""

""Section 1841. Administration of communal forest and pasture.-Communal forests and communal pastures shall be administered by the Director of Forestry, subject to the approval of the Department Head, in such a way as to insure to the people having rights therein a continued supply of forest products necessary for their home use and sufficient pasture for their animals, and to this end the Director of Forestry may prescribe the species and sizes of trees that may be cut, the manner of removal of such trees or other forest products, stone, or earth, and the conditions under which pastures may be occupied. Subject to like approval, exploitation of a communal forest for revenue shall be allowed by the Director of Forestry, under a special license, only when the best interest of the forest requires cutting in excess of local needs.""
