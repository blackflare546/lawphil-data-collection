By authority of the President of the United States, be it enacted by the United States Philippine Commission, that:
Section 1. The Civil Service Board shall proceed forthwith to investigate the fairness of the salaries now paid to all the members of the Philippine Civil Service, and shall report at as early a day as possible a plan for the readjustment of such salaries under which the salaries paid shall be proportioned to the amount of labor and skill required and the responsibility imposed in the discharge of the duties of the respective positions, and which shall afford opportunity for a proper classification of positions under the Civil Service Act.
Section 2. In the prosecution of the investigation enjoined in the foregoing section, the Civil Service Board is authorized through the Military Governor to summon to appear before it the heads of the civil departments and such of their subordinates as may be deemed necessary, to answer questions and to produce papers relevant to the inquiry. The Board shall append to its report the evidence taken by it. In the execution of this Act, the Board shall also consider the report of a board of Army officers to the Military Governor upon a readjustment of civil salaries and shall submit a comparison between its adjustment and that of said board of Army officers, and where there is a difference, its reasons.
Section 3. In its investigation and report the Board shall treat the offices, the duties of which are now discharged by the officers of the Army or Navy under detail, as if filled by civilians, and shall report the proper salaries for such offices. It shall also investigate and report the salaries that, upon the same basis, should be paid to civilians performing clerical or other similar duties in military offices, but who are paid from the Insular civil funds.1a—àphi1
Section 4. This Act shall take effect on its passage.
