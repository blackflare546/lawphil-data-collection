Such restrictions shall be imposed as to incurring indebtedness and extending credit to individuals as the Secretary of the Interior upon recommendation of the Insular Auditor may require.

Section 5. The provincial treasurer shall be accountable for the funds and property of the trading system including er its branches or any commercial project operated therewith, and shall keep the books of account and records thereof as the Insular Auditor shall prescribe.
Section 6. In all matters pertaining to accountability the bonded employees provided for in section four shall deemed subordinates of said provincial treasurer, nor shall any bonded employee be retained, if that officer shall certify that he is incompetent or unsuited for the position which he holds.
