Whereas, although it was not the intention of the Legislature to exempt nonstock corporations from the payment of the fee for the filing of their articles of incorporation with the division of archives, patents, copyrights, and trademarks of the Executive Bureau, yet section eight of Act Numbered Fourteen hundred and fifty-nine, as amended by Act Numbered Twenty-one hundred and thirty-five, might be construed as exempting them from such payment: Now, therefore,
By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Legislature, that:
Section 1. Section eight of Act Numbered Fourteen hundred and fifty-nine, as amended by section one of Act Numbered Twenty-one hundred and thirty-five, is hereby further amended by adding at the end thereof the following provisos:
""Provided, however, That the chief of the division of archives, patents, copyrights, and trade-marks of the Executive Bureau shall collect and receive a fee of twenty-five pesos from every nonstock corporation filing articles of incorporation under the provisions of this Act: Provided, further, That all collections of fees heretofore made by said chief of division for the said purpose from nonstock corporations are hereby ratified and approved.""
Section 2. This Act shall take effect on its passage.
Enacted, January 30, 1915.
