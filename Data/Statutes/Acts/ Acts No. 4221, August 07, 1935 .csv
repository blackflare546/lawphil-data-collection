AN ACT ESTABLISHING PROBATION FOR PERSONS, EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE OR ABOVE, CONVICTED OF CERTAIN CRIMES BY THE COURTS OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS; PROVIDING PROBATION OFFICERS THEREFOR; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:
Section 1. Whenever any person eighteen years of age more, more at the time of committing a criminal offense or misdemeanor is convicted and sentenced by a Court of First Instance or by the Supreme Court on appeal, for such offense or misdemeanor, the proper Court of First Instance may after the sentence has become final arid before the defendant has begun the service thereof, suspend the execution of said sentence and place the defendant on probation for such period as it may determine not less nor exceeding the minimum and maximum periods prescribed in this Act. No person, however, shall be placed on probation until an investigation and report by the probation officer shall have been made to the court of the circumstances of his offense, his criminal record, if any, and his social history and until the provincial fiscal shall have been given an opportunity to be heard. The court shall enter in the minutes the reasons for its action.
Section 2. The probationer shall be subject to the supervision and visitation of the probation officer and shall comply faithfully with such conditions as the court may deem proper to impose in accordance with the following section. Every probation officer shall have, as to persons placed in probation under his care, the powers of a police officer.
Section 3. The conditions of probation shall be such as the court, in its discretion, may prescribe and may include, among others, the following:
That the probationer (a) shall indulge in no injurious or vicious habits;

(b) Shall avoid places or persons of disreputable or harmful character;
(c) Shall report to the probation officer as directed by the court or probation officers;

The court may at any time revise, modify or enlarge the conditions or period of probation. The court shall notify the probation officer in writing of the period and terms of probation.
Section 4. If after the period of probation the probation officer reports and the court finds, that the probationer has complied with the conditions of probation, the court shall order the definite termination of his case and his final discharge from supervision.
Section 5. Whenever within the period of probation, any probationer shall fail to comply with the conditions imposed upon him, the court may issue a warrant for his arrest and may commit him with or without bail. Upon his being arraigned and after an opportunity to be heard the court may revoke, continue or, modify his probation. It revoked, the court shall order the execution of the sentence originally imposed.
Section 6. It shall be the duty of every probation officer to furnish to all persons placed on probation under his supervision a statement of the period and conditions of their probation, and to instruct them concerning the same; to keep informed concerning their conduct and condition; to aid and encourage them by friendly advice and admonition, and by such other measures, not inconsistent with the conditions imposed by the court as may seem most suitable, to bring about improvement in their conduct and condition; to report in writing to the court having jurisdiction over said probationers at least once every two months concerning their conduct and condition; to keep records of their work; to make such reports as are necessary for the information of the Secretary of Justice and as the latter may require; and to perform such other duties as are consistent with the functions of the probation officer and as the court or judge may direct.
