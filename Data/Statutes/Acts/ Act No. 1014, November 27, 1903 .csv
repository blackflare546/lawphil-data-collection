AN ACT FOR THE RELIEF OF THE LAND TAXPAYERS IN THE MUNICIPAL­ITIES OF CANDON AND SANTA CATALINA IN THE PROVINCE OF ILOCOS SUR.
Whereas the valuation of the real estate listed for taxation in the municipalities of Candon and Santa Catalina, Province of Ilocos Sur was erroneously stated for the year nineteen hundred and two in Mexican currency and was collected as though such valuation had been expressed in United States currency at the same figures;
Whereas the amount of such tax collected in nineteen hundred and two was consequently double the amount that would have been collected if the valuations had been properly made m United States currency; and
