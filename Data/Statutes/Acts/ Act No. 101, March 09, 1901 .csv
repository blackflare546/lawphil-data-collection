""The appropriation hereby made shall be first used, so far as it will go, toward finishing what is known in the Spanish plan as the western breakwater of said harbor, and extending the same in a southerly direction so that its end will be in water about the depth of thirty feet at mean low water, and in dredging behind and within said breakwater to a depth not exceeding thirty feet at mean low water, so that shipping of the largest class now frequenting the port of Manila may be able to be under its protection; to improve the present canal connecting the harbor thus made with the Pasig River, and to improve the Pasig River below the Bridge of Spain and the bar at the mouth of the river. So much of the material excavated by such dredging as shall be necessary for the purpose shall be deposited behind a timber bulkhead and elsewhere where required to form land in shallow water near and along the shore line of the harbor.1a—àphi1 The said bulkhead shall also be erected in accordance with the said modified plans of the Chief Engineer. As soon as reasonably practicable a channel shall be provided about five hundred feet in width and thirty feet in depth at mean low water from the end of the western breakwater, when completed according to said modified plans, to the said bulkhead, so that deep draft vessels may be alongside any wharves which may hereafter be provided on the line of said bulkhead and load and unload without the use of lighters.
