Upon the seizure the sure­ties of the defaulting or deceased officer shall be at once notified thereof by the Insular Treasurer.  The Auditor shall forward to the provincial, attorney a statement of the account of the defaulting or deceased officer, and request suit to be brought for any balance which may be due upon the official bond of the defaulting or deceased officer, and in such suit the account stated by the Insular Auditor shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due on the bond.
