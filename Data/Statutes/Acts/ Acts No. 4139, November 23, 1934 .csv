The rate of rental to be charged for each term which shall not exceed twenty-five per centum of the value of the books for one year or fifteen per centum for one semester shall be decided by the Secretary of Public Instruction upon the recommendation of the Director of Education. The rent shall be payable in advance before such term or semester: Provided, That pupils desiring to purchase instead of rent textbooks may be allowed to do so: And provided, further, That if in the opinion of the Director of Education, the funds available for the purchase of textbooks to be rented in accordance with the provision of this Act are not enough to acquire textbooks for the intermediate and secondary pupils, preference shall be given to the purchase of textbooks for the lower grades.
Section 2. The books to be rented shall be purchased by the Bureau of Education out of the reimbursable funds provided under the authority of section six hundred and four of the Revised Administrative Code. All income from the renting or sale of these books shall accrue to that fund.1a—àphi1
