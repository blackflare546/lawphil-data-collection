 Petitioners,

vs.


BANQUE NATIONALE DE PARIS,

 Respondent.

CARPIO MORALES, 
J.:


It appears that sometime in 1995, petitioner Proton Pilipinas Corporation (Proton) availed of the credit facilities of herein respondent, Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP). To guarantee the payment of its obligation, its co-petitioners Automotive Corporation Philippines (Automotive), Asea One Corporation (Asea) and Autocorp Group (Autocorp) executed a corporate guarantee
2
 to the extent of US$2,000,000.00. BNP and Proton subsequently entered into three trust receipt agreements dated June 4, 1996,
3
 January 14, 1997,
4
 and April 24, 1997.

Under the terms of the trust receipt agreements, Proton would receive imported passenger motor vehicles and hold them in trust for BNP. Proton would be free to sell the vehicles subject to the condition that it would deliver the proceeds of the sale to BNP, to be applied to its obligations to it. In case the vehicles are not sold, Proton would return them to BNP, together with all the accompanying documents of title.


Allegedly, Proton failed to deliver the proceeds of the sale and return the unsold motor vehicles.


Pursuant to the corporate guarantee, BNP demanded from Automotive, Asea and Autocorp the payment of the amount of US$1,544,984.40

 representing Proton's total outstanding obligations. These guarantors refused to pay, however. Hence, BNP filed on September 7, 1998 before the Makati Regional Trial Court (RTC) a complaint against petitioners praying that they be ordered to pay (1) US$1,544,984.40 plus accrued interest and other related charges thereon subsequent to August 15, 1998 until fully paid and (2) an amount equivalent to 5% of all sums due from petitioners as attorney's fees.


The Makati RTC Clerk of Court assessed the docket fees which BNP paid at ₱352,116.30

 which was computed as follows:
