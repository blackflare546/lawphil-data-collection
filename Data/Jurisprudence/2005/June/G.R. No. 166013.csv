G.R. No. 166013               June 08, 2005


INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL MANILA,
 petitioner,

vs.


SPOUSES PEDRITO and CARMENCITA AÑINON and THE COURT OF APPEALS,
 respondents.


R E S O L U T I O N


CALLEJO, SR., 
J.:


This petition for review on 
certiorari
 seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision
1
 dated March 30, 2004, as well as the Resolution
2
 dated October 28, 2004, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 74110. The said decision denied the Petition for 
Certiorari
 and Prohibition with Prayer for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction filed by petitioner International School Manila. The CA ruled that the court 
a quo
 acquired jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner and that there was no improper venue. The appellate court likewise added that the fair and speedy disposition of the case far outweighs the misapprehension by the 
court a quo
 of petitioner’s residence.


After the respondents, Spouses Pedrito and Carmencita Aniñon, filed their comment on the instant petition, a Joint Motion for Judgment Based on Compromise Agreement was filed with this Court by both parties. Its full text reads as follows:
