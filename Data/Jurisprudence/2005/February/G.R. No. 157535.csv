vs.


FELINO M. TIMBOL and EMMANUELA R. LAGUARDIA,

CARPIO-MORALES, 
J.:


Being challenged in the present Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 is the February 28, 2003 decision
1 
 of the Court of Appeals dismissing the Petition for 
Certiorari
 of herein petitioner, Philippine National Bank (PNB), which sought to set aside the September 8, 2000 Order
2 
 of Judge Zeus L. Abrogar of the Makati Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 150 granting herein private respondents’ application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.


The following facts are not disputed:


Sometime in December 1996, the PNB International Finance Limited (PNB-IFL), a subsidiary of petitioner, granted Karrich Holdings Limited based in Hongkong and ""owned"" by respondent Felino Timbol, Jr., a Revolving Credit Line and/or for the Opening of Letters of Credit with Trust Receipt Financing in the total amount of US$850,000.00. Karrich Auto Exchange (formerly Superkinis Auto Sales), a sole proprietorship based in the Philippines, also owned by Timbol, acted as co-borrower.


To secure the payment of the obligation, Timbol on his behalf and that of his wife Emmanuela R. Laguardia, executed three (3) separate Real Estate Mortgages (REMs). And respondent Timbol executed promissory notes for and on behalf of Karrich Holdings Ltd.


The first REM, which secured the amount of ₱13,056,600.00, covered the following first 7 titles; the second REM, which secured the amount of ₱7,593,850.00, covered the following 8th title; and the third REM, which secured the amount of ₱2,143,750.00, covered the following 9th title, to wit:




1. TCT No. 196111 
with an area of 44 sq. m.,
 more or less

2. TCT No. 196112 
with an area of 43 sq. m

9. TCT No. 207636

Thus, the aggregate amount of the obligation was ₱22,796,200.00 or its equivalent of US$850,000.00.


The borrowers drew on the credit facilities.


The credit facilities were, by letter
12 
 of April 1, 1998, renewed, revised and reduced to US$848,300.00 by the PNB.


As the borrowers defaulted in the payment of their obligation, petitioner, by letter of September 2, 1999,
13 
 informed Karrich Holdings Limited at its Hongkong address and the spouses Timbol at their 9626 Kamagong, Makati address that, as of July 15, 1999, their outstanding obligation stood at ₱36,088.173.69 inclusive of interest and penalties and demanded that they settle the same in full ""or make acceptable arrangement for its settlement with our PNB-IFL immediately upon receipt hereof."" By the same letter, petitioner warned the borrowers that if they failed to heed the demand, 
it would be constrained to proceed with the foreclosure of the mortgages which secured their account
.


Responding to the September 2, 1999 letter of petitioner, borrowers Karrich Holdings Ltd. and Timbol, by an undated letter
14 
 addressed to Atty. Reyes G. Geromo, Manager and Head, Foreclosure Group, Philippine National Bank, PNB Financial Center, Roxas Blvd., Metro Manila, bearing Timbol’s signature, which letter was received by the PNB Legal Department on October 27, 1999, stated as follows:


This is in reference to your letter of September 2, 1999 which was received only today, October 19, 1999.


We are well aware of our total outstanding obligation with you which stood at 
P33
 (
sic
) 
Million
 as of July 15, 1999
 including interest and penalties.


Given that our application for a new fully secured loan of 
US$ 16 Million
 was recently turned down by PNB-IFL, we were constrained to apply with an alternative lender who can look sympathetically at our project and be considerate of our circumstances. The application is currently being processed against the issuance of a Guarantee Payment Bond being underwritten with the participation of PNB Insurance and GSIS, and we have reason to believe that it is only a matter of time before the facility is granted to us.


In view thereof, 
we would like to request for an additional time within which to secure our obligation with you
. We would also like to request that our obligation be denominated in Philippine peso to avoid further foreign exchange losses.


Thank you for your kind understanding and consideration. (Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)

It appears that the borrowers’ request for an additional time within which ""to secure [their] obligation"" was denied by petitioner for soon after it moved to extrajudicially foreclose the mortgages before a notary public.


Acting on the application for extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages, Makati City Notary Public Ricardo M. Espina issued a Notice of Extrajudicial Sale which was published in three (3) issues of the 
Remate,
 a newspaper of general circulation printed and published in Manila, Philippines, on October 19, 26, and November 2, 1999 following which 
Remate
 Vice President-Advertising executed an Affidavit of Publication dated November 3, 1999.
16 


On November 15, 1999, the extrajudicial foreclosure sale was conducted by Atty. Espina who issued a Certificate of Sale on even date
17 
 stating that the nine (9) properties subject of the REMs were sold for ₱35,669.000.00 at public auction to the highest bidder, petitioner which had submitted its Bid
18 
 for said amount.


More than 3 months shy of the one year period to redeem the foreclosed mortgages or on August 4, 2000, respondent Timbol, on his behalf and that of his co-mortgagor-wife-herein co-respondent Laguardia, filed before the RTC of Makati a complaint against petitioner, Atty. Ricardo F. Espina in his capacity as Makati City Notary Public, and the Makati Register of Deeds, for 
Annulment of Real Estate Mortgage, Foreclosure of Mortgage, Auction Sale and for Accounting, Damages and Temporary Restraining Order and/or Injunction.
19 
 The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 00-946.


In their complaint, respondents alleged that respondent Timbol signed blank REM forms and blank promissory note forms which were forwarded to him and, after signing them, he returned them to petitioner; that he was not furnished copies of the documents despite request therefor, hence, up to the time of the filing of the complaint he did not know what details were placed thereon by petitioner; that the foreclosure of the mortgages conducted by the notary public is ""highly irregular, not valid and thus illegal"" because (1) the extra judicial foreclosure was not filed in accordance with 
Administrative Order No. 3 dated October 24, 1984
 of the Supreme Court; (2) the Notice of Notary Public’s Sale did not specify the newspaper of general circulation in which such notice was to be published; (3) the Notice of the Notary Public’s Sale was not published in 3 public places in Makati where the encumbered properties are located; (4) there was no showing that said notice was in fact and actually published in a newspaper of general circulation and if it was, it was not in accordance with law, the publication not having been raffled among newspapers; and (5) the notary public did not conduct an actual public bidding, hence, it was a ""sham bidding which was not made within the time prescribed by law.""


Respondents further alleged that the Registry of Deeds of Makati City does not have a copy of any mortgage or other loan documents; and that the certificate of sale issued by the notary public was not registered or annotated on the original titles to the mortgaged properties.


Respondents furthermore alleged, 
inter alia
, as follows:
