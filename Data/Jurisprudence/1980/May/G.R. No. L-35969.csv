Automatic review of the judgment of the Circuit Criminal Court, Pasig, Rizal, imposing the death penalty upon Celestino Villacores, 
1
 Romulo Lirio, Pedro Ducay and Abis Gamongan. 


In an Information filed by the Special Prosecutor on October 10, 1972, the afore-mentioned appellants were charged with Murder and Multiple Frustrated Murder, as follows: 
têñ.£îhqwâ£






That on or about May 4, 1972, at the NBP, Muntinlupa, Rizal, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above named accused while then confined at the said institution conspiring, confederating and helping one another did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, with intent to kill with evident premeditation and treachery assault, attack and stab Prisoner ROMEO DOMINGO, No. 75132-P, thereby inflicting upon the latter multiple stab wounds in the different parts of the body such wounds necessarily produced his death and simultaneously inflicting upon RODOLFO ANDAYA, No. 47015-P, ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ, No, 50108-P and ARTURO ALICIA, No. 61739-P all sentenced prisoners in the same institution, stab wounds in the different parts of their bodies, performing all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime of murder as a consequence thereof, but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of their will, that is, by the timely and able defense offered by those injured and the equally, timely assistance of the Prison Guards which prevented their death. 






Upon arraignment on October 27, 1972, the afore-mentioned four accused, with the assistance of counsel 
de oficio
, pleaded guilty. The Court informed the appellants in Tagalog, a dialect known to them, of the consequences of their plea of guilty and that because of the nature of the crime, the imposable penalty is death. They, however, reiterated their plea of guilty and expressed their readiness to accept the penalty to be imposed upon them no matter how grave it may be. Hence, the trial court, in view of the voluntary and spontaneous confession of guilt made by the accused Celestino Villacores, Romulo Lirio, Pedro Ducay and Abis Gamongan, stated that it found them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder pursuant to Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code as charged in the Information and sentenced them to suffer the penalty of death; to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P12,000.00, jointly and severally; to pay jointly and severally P10,000.00 as moral damages and another P10,000.00 as exemplary damages; and to pay their proportionate share of the costs. However, the trial court, ""in consonance with the doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court in
 People v. Epifanio Flores,
"" 
2
 ordered the Special Prosecutor ""to present evidence to determine the degree of culpability of the accused."" 


Pursuant to the afore-mentioned Order, the Special Prosecutor presented evidence on October 28, 1972 and December 9, 1972. After the prosecution had rested its case, the trial court issued an Order, in effect affirming the prisoners' sentence of death and directed the Clerk of Court to forward the complete records of this case to the Supreme Court upon transcription of the stenographic notes taken by the stenographers within a reasonable period of time. 


The counsel de oficio contends in his brief for appellants that the court 
a quo
, in convicting the accused, failed to observe the necessary precaution to ensure that when the accused pleaded guilty, they really and truly understood and comprehended the meaning, full significance and consequences of their plea. He contended that although the court ordered the presentation of evidence to establish the guilt and degree of culpability of the accused, after he pronounced his judgment, the evidence presented ""could not have fulfilled the function of establishing the guilt or degree of culpability of the accused. It merely confirms the judgment previously entered."" The Solicitor General, in substance, concurs with the foregoing observation and recommends that the decision under review be vacated and the case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings. 


We find these contentions untenable. To preclude any doubt that there was mistake or misunderstanding on the part of the accused as to the nature of the charges to which they pleaded guilty, the court 
a quo
 precisely ordered the prosecution to present evidence ""to determine the culpability of the accused."" On October 28, 1972, the prosecution presented testimonial and documentary evidence to prove the guilt of the four accused. 


There is no question that the purpose of the presentation of evidence after the plea of guilty in capital offenses is to preclude any room for ""reasonable doubt in the mind of either the trial court or this Court, on review, as to the possibility that there might have been some misunderstanding on the part of the accused as to the nature of the charges to which he pleaded guilty""; and to ascertain the circumstances attendant to the commission of the crime ""which justify or require the exercise of a greater or less degree of severity in the imposition of the prescribed penalties."" 
3


 We have suggested that the trial courts should adopt such procedure in 
People v. Busa, 
4


 for apart from the circumstance that such procedure may remove any doubt that the accused fully understood the consequences of his plea is the fact that the evidence take thereon is essential to the fulfillment by this Court of its duty of review of automatic appeals from death sentences. 
têñ.£îhqwâ£






Moreover, since there is no law prohibiting the taking of testimony after a plea of guilty, where a grave offense is charged, this Court has deemed such taking of testimony the prudent and proper course to follow for the purpose of establishing the guilt and the precise degree of culpability of the defendant. This procedure, when conscientiously applied and followed, will leave no room for doubt that there was mistake or misunderstanding on the part of the accused as to the nature of the charges to which he pleads guilty. 


Further, the taking of testimony, notwithstanding a plea of guilty, is essential to the fulfillment by this Court of its duty of review of automatic appeals from death sentences. To illustrate this point, in 
U.S. vs. Jamad
, the testimonies received by the trial court following the plea of guilty by the accused enabled this Court to modify the judgment by striking down the two aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation 
(premeditacion conocida),
 and abuse of confidence alleged in the information. This Court's findings showed that the accused could not have intended their inclusion in his plea of guilty. Surely, records which merely sketchily declare that the information was read to the accused and that the latter ""freely, voluntarily and spontaneously entered the plea of guilty"", do not tell the whole story. They deny us full opportunity to review the cases fairly and intelligently.

In the case at bar, it has been sufficiently established by the evidence that at about 11:30 o'clock in the morning of May 4, 1972 inside the New Bilibid Prisons, a prisoner, Romeo Domingo, who was on his way to Gate IV for a visit, was stabbed, while three (3) other prisoners, Arturo Alicia, Rodolfo Andaya and Antonio de la Cruz, members of the ""Batang City Jail Gang"", ""Batang Cebu Gang"", and ""Sigue-Sigue Sputnik Gang"", respectively, were similarly attacked and stabbed while they were in leg-irons, and stationed at the alley adjoining the control gate of the said penitentiary. Romeo Domingo died at the New Bilibid Prisons Hospital at about 8:10 p.m. on May 5, 1972. Tolentino Avelina of the Investigation Section of the National Penitentiary testified that he was one of those assigned to investigate the aforesaid incident. In that investigation, appellants admitted to him that because of rivalry among their gangs they attacked and stabbed the aforementioned victims. To this effect, appellant Celestino Villacores, 29 years of age, married, of Cabugao Ilocos Sur, declared before the investigator, thus:

In connection with the execution of the afore-mentioned extrajudicial admissions, appellants surrendered to the prison authorities the improvised sharp-pointed weapons which they used against the victims (Exhibits ""B"", ""C"", ""D"" and ""E""). The afore-mentioned extrajudicial confessions are admissible in evidence.

Dr. Mario C. Nalagan, Senior Medico-Legal Officer of the NBI who conducted the autopsy on Romeo Domingo, testified that the deceased sustained the following wounds: 
têñ.£îhqwâ£






Stab wounds: 1 — 3.0 cms. in size, edges clean cut, medial border sharp, lateral border contused, oriented upwards and medially located at the left upper chest anterior aspect 14 cms. from the anterior median line, 132 cms. from left heel. Directed backwards, downwards and medially thru the 4th intercostal space into the left thoraxic cavity perforating the upper lobe of lung, percardial sac and penetrating the left ventricle Depth 14 cms. 


2 — 3.0 cms. in size, edges clean cut, upper extremely sharp, lower extremity contused, oriented vertically and located at the left upper chest along the anterior line 18 cms. from the anterior median line, 134 cms. from left heel. Directed backwards, downwards and medially involving soft tissues, non-perforating. Depth 4 cms. 


3 — 2.3 cms. in size, edges clean cut, oriented horizontally, located at the left mesogastric region of the abdomen, 6 cms. from the anterior median line, 106 cms. left heel. Directed backwards, downwards and medially thru the anterior abdominal wall and penetrating the left psoas muscle. Depth 8 cms. (Exhibit ""A"") 






He explained that Romeo Domingo sustained three (3) stab wounds, but it was the stab wound on the left chest (Wound No. 1 in Exhibits ""A"" and ""A-2"") which caused the death of the victim as it perforated the left chest, the upper lobe of the lung and the left ventricle of the heart. When shown the four (4) improvised weapons which the accused admitted having used in stabbing the victims, 
7
 he declared that the weapon, Exhibit ""D"", of appellant Villacores, on the basis of its size and configurations, could have been the weapon used in inflicting the three (3) stab wounds on the chest of the victim. 


Dr. Zoraida Achazo Ocampo, physician of the New Bilibid Prisons, also testified that prisoners Rodolfo Andaya, Antonio de la Cruz and Arturo Alicia, all sustained stab wounds. According to her, Arturo Ancia sustained two (2) stab wounds — (a) one-inch wound at the middle third of the right thigh; and (b) another one-inch wound at the mid-scapular line 9th intercostal space; while Rodolfo Andaya suffered four (4) stab wounds — (a) the first was one-half inch x one-half inch to the left of the mid-sternum 4th intercostal space; (b) the second was a 2-½ inch stab wound at the forearm, mid portion right; (c) the third was a one-inch stab wound, V-shaped at the ddle forearm, left; and (d) the fourth was a one-inch stab wound on the left proximal third forearm, left; while Antonio de la Cruz sustained a one-half inch stab wound on the right index finger. Alicia was confined in the hospital for eight (8) days, while Andaya was hospitalized for five (5) days. 


The afore-mentioned extrajudicial confessions of appellants Villacores, Lirio, Ducay and Gamongan (Exhibits ""H"", ""I"", ""J"" and ""O""), as corroborated by the evidence of 
corpus delicti
, depict the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime and demonstrate convincingly that the pleas of guilty made by appellants were not made inadvertently, but with full awareness of the precise nature of the charges and the possible consequences of their judicial admission of guilt. 
8
 They likewise confirm the existence of conspiracy, revealing that the stabbing was planned and agreed upon by the four accused on the night of May 3, 1972. Necessarily, therefore, they likewise establish the presence of evident premeditation. 
9
 Moreover, it can be gleaned from said confessions that the manner of attack employed by the accused was characterized by treachery, considering the element of surprise and the fact that some of the victims were in leg-irons and thus unable to defend themselves. 


Considering the foregoing, it is evident that independently of the pleas of guilt entered by the herein appellants, the evidence for the prosecution would have been sufficient to sustain a judgment of conviction. The trial court, therefore, was not remiss in ascertaining that the acceptance of the pleas of guilt satisfied all the requirements of the law. 


The only irregularity that may be imputed to the trial judge in the proceedings 
a quo
 was in prematurely sentencing the accused to suffer the penalty of death, prior to ordering the Special Prosecutor to present evidence to determine the degree of culpability of said accused. As this Court held in 
People v. Dumdum, Jr., et al. 
10
 
têñ.£îhqwâ£






The evidence of the prosecution should be presented after the arraignment. The judgment should be rendered and promulgated 
after
 the fiscal has presented his evidence and after the trial court has ascertained that the defense is not presenting any evidence. 






The irregularity, however, is not of sufficient consequence as to justify the setting aside of the judgment of conviction, in the face of the evidence presented by the prosecution which established the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. 
11
 


It appears appropriate, at this stage, to emphasize to trial judges that when an accused pleads guilty to a capital offense wherein the penalty of death is imposed, they should show clearly in their records that they have not accepted with alacrity his plea of guilty, but adopted the prudent and proper course consistent with the fundamental requirements of fairness and due process of taking testimony for the purpose of establishing the guilt and the precise degree of culpability of the defendants. 
12
 


Considering that the crime in the case at bar was committed by appellants while serving sentence for a felony for which they were convicted by final judgment, the penalty imposed upon them which is the maximum period of the penalty prescribed by law for the new felony is, therefore, in accordance with law. 
13
 Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code provides a special aggravating circumstance for quasi-recidivism by imposing the maximum of the penalty for the new offense, and it cannot be offset by any mitigating circumstance. 
14
 


We cannot ignore however the contributory role played by the sub-human conditions in the penitentiary in the formation of gangs, such as this that preyed like wolf packs on the weak. This consideration and the fact that appellants were under detention for a long time impelled some members of this Court to vote for the imposition of a penalty next lower in degree. 


WHEREFORE, the judgment under review is affirmed but for lack of necessary votes, the penalty imposed upon appellants is modified to 
reclusion perpetua
 with the accessories provided by law.

I concur. As stated in the Court's opinion, the accused's plea of guilty in open court with the assistance of counsel and the evidence for the prosecution nevertheless received by the trial court precisely to determine that the accused fully and truly understood the significance and consequence of their guilty plea, sufficiently sustain the judgment of conviction. 


I write this brief opinion to maintain my dissent in the cases of 
Magtoto vs. Manguerra
 (63 SCRA 4, 27) as against the 
obiter dictum
 in the main opinion that the extra-judicial confessions taken before the effectivity of the 1973 Constitution from the accused who were not assisted by counsel nor informed of their right to counsel and to remain silent were admissible in evidence. The 
Magtoto
 ruling should be subjected to reexamination in an appropriate case, in the light of the compelling reasons given in their respective dissents therein by the late Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro and then Senior Associate Justice, now Chief Justice Fernando. 


As stated in my own dissent therein: ""(T)here is 
no room
 for
 interpretation 
and the plain mandate of the Constitution expressly adopting the 
exclusionary rule
 as the only practical means of enforcing the constitutional injunction against such confessions obtained in violation of one's constitutional rights by outlawing their admission and thereby removing the incentive on the part of state and police officers to disregard such rights (in the same manner that the exclusionary rule bars admission of illegally seized evidence) should be strictly enforced,"" and ""(T)he outlawing of all such confessions is plain, unqualified and 
without distinction 
whether the invalid confession be obtained 
before
 or 
after
 the effectivity of the Constitution."" 


MAKASIAR, 
J., 
dissenting: 


I dissent. I concur with the view of the Solicitor General that there was an improvident plea of guilty in this case. 


For a valid plea of guilty to a capital offense, the entire information must be read and interpreted to the accused in the language and dialect with which he is familiar, including the meaning of the qualifying and aggravating circumstances alleged. The accused herein are Ilocanos who belong to the GIG band which had a standing feud with the other gangs in the national penitentiary. The information alleges murder, attempted murder, evident premeditation, and treachery. These terms were not explained to the accused in Ilocano. That the accused did not understand the meaning of these terms and the consequences of their plea of guilty, is demonstrated by their confessions submitted in evidence. Their confessions uniformly state that they agreed to stab (manaksak), not to kill, the inmates in leg irons about 10 o'clock in the night of May 3, 1972. They committed the crime about 11:30 the following morning of May 4, 1972, scarely 13-1/2 hours later. To my mind, there is no sufficient showing of evident premeditation during that period of 13-1/2hours; because, after they agreed to assault or injure (manaksak) the members of the rival groups who were in leg irons, they must certainly have slept after 10 o'clock that night until about 6 o'clock the following morning. There is not even any showing that upon waking up in the morning of May 4, 1972 until 11:30 that same morning, they meditated and reflected on the consequences of their intended action and after such reflection they persisted in their resolve to commit the crime. 


Because their agreement was merely to stab (manaksak), which does not necessarily include killing, the appellants, with respect to the death of Romeo Domingo, are entitled to the mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to inflict so grave an act as that committed. 


There is no treachery because the assault was made about 11:30 in the morning at the construction site within the Bilibid compound where the prisoners in leg irons were working and near the control gate where there was a guard. And it must be presumed also that the prisoners in chains at the construction site were also guarded. Thus there was no employment of the means and utilization of circumstances to insure the successful execution of the crime. As a matter of fact, only one of the three victims died about 8:30 in the evening of that same day, May 4, about ten hours from the attack at 11:30 that morning. And not only were the two who were injured able to parry or evade the blows; but also one of them was able to wrest the bladed weapon from one of the assailants who fled thereafter. Another prisoner in leg irons came to the rescue of one of the victims and was likewise able to stab one of the assailants who also fled. 


In the absence of the qualifying or aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and treachery and the presence of the mitigating circumstance of damage exceeding intent, the crimes committed would be merely homicide and multiple frustrated homicide, the corresponding penalties for which should be imposed in the minimum period. 


However, because the plea of guilty was improvidently made, the case should therefore be remanded for appropriate proceedings.


Fernando, C.J., concurs.
