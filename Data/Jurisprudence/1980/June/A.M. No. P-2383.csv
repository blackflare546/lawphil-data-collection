A.M. No. P-2383	June 25, 1980


In Re: REMEDIOS D. LAUS, Court Interpreter II, Court of First Instance of Leyte.




FERNANDEZ, 
J.:


This has reference to the continuous absence without leave of Remedios D. Laus, Court Interpreter II, in the Court of First Instance of Leyte, Branch III, at Palo, Leyte. 


The record shows that Remedios D. Laus was absent without leave from May 5, 1978 to October 9, 1978. On March 1, 1979, she abandoned her work and has not reported back to duty until now. 


On April 8, 1980, Deputy Court Administrator Arturo B. Buena, through District Judge Godofredo Quimsing, directed Remedios D. Laus to report back to duty and explain in writing why no administrative action should be taken against her. She was warned that if she failed to do so, she would be considered dropped from the service because of her prolonged absence without leave.

Upon instruction of Judge Quimsing, the Deputy Clerk of Court, Aurora A. Zeta, in a letter dated April 28, 1980 reported that the directive of Deputy Court Administrator Buena was personally received by Remedios D. Laus on April 21, 1980 but she has neither come back to work nor submitted an explanation as required.

Having failed to report back to duty and to explain in writing why no administrative action should be taken against her, Remedios D. Laus should be summarily dismissed from office.

WHEREFORE, Remedios D. Laus is hereby DISMISSED as Court Interpreter II in the Court of First Instance of Leyte, Branch III, at Palo, Leyte for absenteeism without leave and dereliction of duty.


SO ORDERED.


Teehankee (Chairman), Makasiar, Guerrero, De Castro and Melencio-Herrera, JJ., concur.
