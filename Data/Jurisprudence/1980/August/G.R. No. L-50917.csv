G.R. No. L-50917	August 29, 1980


TAS WORLD SHIPPING COMPANY, LTD. and NEW FILIPINO MARITIME AGENCIES, INC., 
petitioner,

vs.


MINISTER BLAS F. OPLE, NATIONAL SEAMEN BOARD and ESTRELLA BABAC, 
respondents.
 




AQUINO, 
J.:


On June 22, 1979, Tas World Shipping Co., Ltd., a foreign corporation organized in Japan, and New Filipino Maritime Agencies, Inc., a domestic corporation, filed a petition for certiorari in order to set aside the decision dated March 5, 1979 of the National Seamen Board (composed of the Minister of Labor, as Chairman, and seven members). 


In that decision, the petitioners were ordered to pay Estrella Babac twenty thousand pesos in addition to the sum of twelve thousand pesos already adjudicated to her in connection with the death of her son, Danny Babac, who was employed as a quartermaster in petitioners' vessel. 


The respondents in their comments on the petition defended the additional award made by the National Seamen Board. 


The comments were considered as answers and the parties were directed to file memoranda. 


On June 18, 1980, Estrella Babac filed a verified motion to dismiss the case on the ground that her claim against the petitioners had already been satisfied by the payment to her of the original award amounting to twelve thousand pesos. Attached to her motion is a copy of the ""Receipt and Quit-claim"" signed by her. 


The petitioners in their manifestation of July 23, 1980 stated that, with that payment, the instant case had become moot and academic. 


WHEREFORE, this case is dismissed. No costs. 


SO ORDERRED. 


Barredo (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero and De Castro, JJ., concur. 


Justices Guerrero and De Castro were designated to sit in the Second Division.
