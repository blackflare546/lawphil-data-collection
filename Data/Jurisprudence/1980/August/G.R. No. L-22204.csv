FERNANDO, 
C.J.,


At present pending before this Court is an appeal by the Republic of the Philippines, the oppositor in the application for Filipino citizenship filed by petitioner Santiago Cheng alias Santiago Cheng Un. The decision under review held that petitioner-appellee had all the qualifications prescribe by law and none of the disqualification therein specified. The main ground was the failure to establish by sufficient evidence that his character witnesses are ""credible persons within the contemplation of the Act.""

 The brief for the petitioner-appellee alleged that there is no basis for such an allegation. At any rate, under date of August 15, 1980, a Manifestation and Motion was filed by the Solicitor General,

The Republic of the Philippines has appealed to this Honorable Court the decision of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dated July 11, 1963 granting Philippine citizenship to Santiago Cheng, alias Santiago Cheng Un; 2.
