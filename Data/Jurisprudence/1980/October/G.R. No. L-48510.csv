SECOND DIVISION


G.R. No. L-48510	October 17, 1980


ASSOCIATED LABOR UNIONS (ALU), 
petitioner,

vs.


SECRETARY OF LABOR and STANDARD (PHIL.) FRUIT CORPORATION, 
respondents.




AQUINO, 
J.:


The Associated Labor Unions filed on September 5, 1978 a petition for 
certiorari
, wherein it assailed the decision of the Secretary of Labor dated May 12, 1978, dismissing its complaint for additional compensation corresponding to the waiting or assembly time, and prayed for the affirmance of the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission, holding that the assembly time is ""time-worked"" and is, therefore, compensable working time.


The petition was given due course. The parties filed their memoranda. The case was submitted for decision on August 22, 1979.


On September 16, 1979, petitioner union filed a motion praying that its petition be considered withdrawn and the case dismissed because the parties had arrived at a compromise agreement dated September 8, 1980.


One of the conditions of that agreement is that the union should withdraw its appeal (meaning its petition) in this case, L-48510.


WHEREFORE, the motion is granted. This case is dismissed and considered closed. No costs.


SO ORDERED.


Barredo, Fernandez, Abad Santos, and De Castro, JJ., concur.


Justice Concepcion, Jr., is on leave. 


Justice Fernandez was designated to sit in the Second Division.
