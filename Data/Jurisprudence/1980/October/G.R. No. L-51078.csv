The petitioner alleges that than ten (10) years ago, the government through the Department of Public Workmen's and Communication (now MPH) prepared a to Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) to Roxas Boulevard; that the proposed extension, an adjunct of building program, the Manila — Cavite Coastal Read Project, would pass through Cuneta Avenue up to Roxas Boulevard that this route would be a straight one taking into account the direction of EDSA; that preparation to the implementation of the aforesaid plan, or on December 13, 1974, then Secretary Baltazar Aquino of the Department of Public Highways directed the City Engineer of Pasay City not to issue temporary or permanent permits for the construction and/or improvement of buildings and other structures located within the proposed extension through Cuneta Avenue that shortly thereafter the Department of Public Highways decided to make the proposed extension go through Fernando Rein and Del Pan Streets which are lined with old substantial houses; that upon learning of the changed the owners of the residential houses that would be affected, the herein petitioner being one of them, filed on April 15, 1977 a formal petition to President Ferdinand E. Marcos asking him to order the Ministry of Public Highways to adoption, the original plan of making the extension of EDSA through Araneta Avenue instead of the new plan going through Fernando Rein and Del Pan Streets; that President Marcos directed then Minister Baltazar Aquino to explain within twenty-four (24) hours why the proposed project should not be suspended; that on April 21, 1977 then Minister Aquino submitted his explanation defending the new proposed route; that the President then referred the matter to the Human Settlements Commission for investigation and recommendation; that after formal hearings to which all the parties proponents and oppositors were given full opportunity to ventilate their views and to present their evidence, the Settlements Commission submitted a report recommending the reversion of the extension of EDSA to the original plan passing through Cuneta Avenue; and that notwithstanding the said report and recommendation, the Ministry of Public Highways insisted on implementing the plan to make the extension of EDSA go through Fernando Rein and Del Pan Streets.

In February 1979, the government filed in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch III, Pascual City presided by the respondent Judge, a complaint for expropriation against the owners of the houses standing along Fernando Rein and Del Pan Streets, among them the herein petitioner. The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 7001-P and entitled 
""Republic of the Philippines vs. Concepcion Cabarrus Vda. de Santos, etc
.
""


The herein petitioner filed a motion to dismiss dated March 19, 1979 on the following grounds: 


(a)	court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action because the complaint failed to allege that the instant project for expropriation bore the approval of the Ministry of Human Settlements and the Metro Manila Government nor pursuant to Presidential Decrees Nos. 824, 1396 and 1517;


(b) 	The choice of properties to be expropriated made by the Ministry of Public Highways was arbitrary and erroneous;


(c) 	The complaint was premature as the plaintiff never really had gone through serious negotiations with the defendant for the purchase of her property; and


(d) 	The complaint relied on an arbitrary and erroneous valuation of properties and disregarded consequential damages. 


An urgent motion dated March 28, 1979 for preliminary junction was also filed.


In June 1979 the Republic of the Philippines filed a motion for the issuance of a writ of possession of the property sought to be expropriated on the ground that said Republic had made the required deposit with the Philippine National Bank.


The respondent judge issued a writ of possession dated June 14, 1979 authorizing the Republic of the Philippines to take and enter upon the possession of the properties sought be condemned. 
3




The petitioner contends that ""Respondent court lacked or exceeded its jurisdiction or gravely abused its discretion in issuing the order to take over and enter upon the possession of the properties sought to be expropriated-petitioner having raised a constitutional question which respondent court must resolve before it can issue an order to take or enter upon the possession of properties sought to be expropriated."" 
4




The petitioner assails the choice of the Fernando Rein and Del Pan Streets route on the following grounds:




The choice of property to be expropriated cannot be without rhyme or reason. The condemnor may not choose any property it wants. Where the legislature has delegated a power of eminent do-main, the question of the necessity for taking a particular fine for the intended improvement rests in the discretion of the grantee power subject however to review by the courts in case of fraud, bad faith or gross abuse of discretion. The choice of property must be examined for bad faith, arbitrariness or capriciousness and due process determination as to whether or not the proposed location was proper in terms of the public interests. Even the claim of respondent's Secretary Baltazar Aquino that there would be a saving of P2 million under his new plan must be reviewed for it bears no relation to the site of the proposed EDSA extension As envisioned by the government, the EDSA extension would be linked to the Cavite Expressway. Logically then, the proposed extension must point to the south and not detour to the north.


Also, the equal protection of the law must be accorded, not on to the motel owners along Cuneta (Fisher) Avenue, but also to the owners of solid and substantial homes and quality residential lands occupied for generations. 
5




The respondents maintain that the respondent court did not act without jurisdiction or exceed its jurisdiction or gravel abuse its discretion in issuing the order dated June 14, 1979 authorizing the Republic of the Philippines to take over and enter the possession of the properties sought to be appropriated because the Republic has complied with all the statutory requirements which entitled it to have immediate possession of the properties involved.

Defending the change of the EDSA extension to pass through Fernando Rein — Del Pan Streets, the respondents aver:




'There was no sudden change of plan in the selection of the site of the EDSA Extension to Roxas Blvd. As a matter of fact, when the Ministry of Public Highways decided to change the site of EDSA Ex- tension to Roxas Boulevard from Cuneta Avenue to the Del Pan — Fernando Item Streets the residents of Del Pan and Fernando Rein Streets who were to be adversely affected by the construction of ED — SA Extension to Roxas Boulevard along Del Pan - Fernando Rein Streets were duly notified of such proposed project. Petitioner herein was one of those notified Annex 1). It be conceded that the Cuneta Avenue line goes southward and outward (from the city center while the Del Pan — Fernando Rein Streets line follows northward and inward direction. It must be stated that both lines, Cuneta Avenue and Del Pan — Fernando Rein Streets lines, meet satisfactorily planning and design criteria and therefore are both acceptable. In selecting the Del Pan — Fernando Rein Streets line the Government did not do so because it wanted to save the motel located along Cuneta Avenue but because it wanted to minimize the social impact factor or problem involved.

There is no question as to the right of the Republic of the Philippines to take private property for public use upon the payment of just compensation. Section 2, Article IV of the Constitution of the Philippines provides: ""Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.""


It is recognized, was, that the government may not capriciously or arbitrarily' choose what private property should be taken. In 
J. M. Tuazon & Co., Inc. vs. Land Tenure 
administration 31 SCRA, 413, 433, the Supreme Court said:




For the purpose of obtaining a judicial declaration of nullity, it is enough if the respondents or defendants named be the government officials who would give operation and effect to official action allegedly tainted with unconstitutionality. Thus, where the statute assailed was sought to be enforced by the Land Tenure Administrative and the Solicitor General, the two officials may be made respondents in the action without need of including the Executive Secretary as a party in the action


The failure to meet tile exacting standard of due process would likewise constitute a valid objection to the exercise of this congressional power. That was so intimated in the above leading Guido Case. There was an earlier pronouncement to that effect in a decision rendered long before the adoption of the Constitution under the previous organic law then in force, while the Philippines was still an unincorporated territory of the United States.


It is obvious then that a landowner is covered by the mantle of protection due process affords. It is a mandate of reason. It frowns on arbitrariness, it is the antithesis of any governmental act that smacks of whim or caprice. It negates state power to act in an impressive manner. It is, as had been stressed so often, the embodiment of the sporting Idea of fair play. In that sense, it stands as a guaranty of justice. That is the standard that must be met by any government talk agency in the exercise of whatever competence is entrusted to it. As was so emphatically stressed by the present Chief Justice, 'Acts of Congress, as well as those of the Executive, can deny due process only under pain of nullity, ...




In the same case the Supreme Court concluded:




With due recognition then of the power of Congress to designate the particular property to be taken and how much thereof may be condemned in the exercise of the power of expropriation, it is still a judicial question whether in the exercise of such competence, the party adversely affected is the victim of partiality and prejudice. That the equal protection clause will not allow. (p. 436)




In the instant case, it is a fact that the Department of Public Highways originally establish the extension of EDSA along Cuneta Avenue. It is to be presumed that the Department of Public Highways made studies before deciding on Cuneta Avenue. It is indeed odd why suddenly the proposed extension of EDSA to Roxas Boulevard was changed to go through Fernando Rein-Del Pan Streets which the Solicitor General con- cedes ""... the Del Pan — Fernando Rein Streets line follows northward and inward direction. While admit ""that both lines, Cuneta Avenue and Del Pan — Fernando Rein Streets lines, meet satisfactorily planning and design criteria and therefore are both acceptable ... the Solicitor General justifies the change to Del Pan — Fernando Rein Streets on the ground that the government ""wanted to the social impact factor or problem involved.""

It is doubtful whether the extension of EDSA along Cuneta Avenue can be objected to on the ground of social impact. The improvements and buildings along Cuneta Avenue to be affected by the extension are mostly motels. Even granting, 
arguendo
, that more people be affected, the Human Setlements Commission has suggested coordinative efforts of said Commission with the National Housing Authority and other government agencies in the relocation and resettlement of those adversely affected.

The Human Settlements Commission considered conditionality social impact and cost. The pertinent portion of its report reads:




Comparison of Alignment 1 (Cuneta Fisher) and Alignment 2 (Del Pan — Fernando Rein) based on the criteria of functionality, social impact and cost


A. 	
Functionality


This issue has to do with the physical design of a highway, inclusive of engineering factors and management consideration 


From both engineering and traffic management viewpoints, it is incontestable that the straighter and shorter alignment is preferable to one which is not. Systematically and diagramatically, alignment 1 is straighter than alignment 2. In fact, Director Antonio Goco of the Department of Public Highways admitted that alignment 2 is three (3) meters longer than alignment 1. Furthermore, alignment 1 is definitely the contour conforming alignment to EDSA whereas alignment 2 affords a greater radius of unnatural curvature as it hooks slightly northward before finally joining with Roxas Boulevard. Besides, whichever alignment is adopted, there will be a need for a grade separator or interchange at the Roxas Boulevard junction. From the of highway design, it is imperative to have interchanges as far apart as possible to avoid traffic from slow down in negotiating the slope on the interchanges. Up north would be the future Buendia Avenue- Roxas Boulevard Interchange. Consequently, alignment 1 which is farther away from Buendia Avenue than alignment 2 is the better alignment from the viewpoint of the construction of the grade separator or interchange, a necessary corollary to the extension project. Finally, the choice of alignment 2 which is longer by three (3) meters than alignment 1 could have serious repercussions on our energy conservation drive and from the larger perspective of the national economy, considering that, by ad- statistical data, no less than fifty thousand (50,000) vehicles a day will have to traverse an extra three (3) meters.


B. 	Social Impact


The following factual data which have a direct bearing on the issue of social impact were culled from the records of the case and the evidence presented during the public hearings:








(1) Number of property owners:




 






Alignment 1




73






Alignment 2




49






(2) Incidence of non-resident owner:




 






Alignment 1




25 (34.3%)






Alignment 2




31 (63.3%)






(3) Number of actually affected residents: 




 






Alignment 1




547






Alignment 2




290 (estimated)






(4) Average income of residents:




 






Alignment 2:




 










Below P350 P350 – P500 P 500 – P 800 P800 – Pl000 Over P1000 16 (28%) 24 (42%) 0 (14%) 5 (9%) 4 (7%)


Alignment 2: Figures not available.


It is evident from the foregoing figures that social impact is greater on the residents of alignment 1.


C. 	
Cost


The resolution of the issue of right-of-way acquisition cost depends to a large extend on the nature of the properties to be affected and the relative value thereof. A comparison of alignment 1 and alignment 2 on these two points has produced the following results:


(1) 	Nature and number of properties involved:


Line I Line 2 	 		 










Lots

Improvement

(2) 	Relative value of properties affected:

Alignment 1










P9,300,136










P5,928,680










P15,228,816












Alignment 2










8,314,890










6,644,130










14,959,020












Difference








 




 






P269,796














It is obvious from the immediately table that the right- of-way acquisition cost difference factor of the two alignment is only P269,196 and not P2M as alleged by the Department of Public Highways and P1.2M as claimed by the oppositors. Consequently, the cost difference factor between the two alignments is so minimal as to be practically nil in the consideration of the issues involved in this case. 
10




After considering all the issues and factors, the Human Setlements Commission made the following recommendations:




Weighing in the balance the issues and factors of necessity, functionality, impact, cost and property valuation as basis for scheme of compensation to be adopted in the instant case, the Hearing Board takes cognizance of the following points: 


1. 	The EDSA extension to Roxas Boulevard is necessary and desirable from the strictly technical viewpoint and the overall perspective of the Metro Manila transport system.


2. 	The right-of-way acquisition cost difference factor is so minimal as to influence in any way the choice of either alignment as the extension of EDSA to Roxas Boulevard.


3.	The negotiated sale approach to compensation as proposed should apply to a whichever alignment is selected.


4. 	The factor of functionality states strongly against the selection of alignment 2 while the factor of great social and economic impact bears grieviously on the residents of alignment 1.


The course of the decision in this case consequently boils down to the soul-searching and heart-rending choice between people on one hand and progress and development on the other. In deciding in favor of the latter, the Hearing Board is not unmindful that progress and development are carried out by the State precisely and ultimately for the benefit of its people and therefore, recommends the reverend of the extension project to alignment 1. However, before the Government, through its implementing agencies, particularly the Department of Public Highways, undertakes the actual step of appropriating properties on alignment I to pave the way for the extension the hearing Board recommends the following as absolute. binding and imperative preconditions: 


1. 	The preparation, and ignore importantly, the execution of a comprehensive and detailed plan for the relocation and resettlement of the adversely and genuinely affected residents of alignment I which will necessitate the coordinative efforts of such agencies as the Human Settlements Commission, the National Housing Authority and other such governmental agencies. To be concrete, a self sufficient community or human settlement complete with infrastructure capture market, school, church and industries for employment should be set up to enable the affected residents of alignment 1 to maintain, their present social and economic standing.


2. 	The prompt payment of fair and just compensation through the negotiated sale approach.


Finally, the Hearing Board recommends that the Department of Public Highways conduct public hearings before undertaking on future expropriations of private properties for public use.


Respectfully submitted to the Human Settlements Commission Commissioners for consideration, final disposition and endorsement thereof to His Excellency, the President of the Philippines.


Makati, Metro Manila, July 4, 1977. 
11




... From all the foregoing, the facts of record and recommendations of the Human Settlements Commission, it is clear that the choice of Fernando Rein — Del Pan Streets as the line through which the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue should be extended to Roxas Boulevard is arbitrary and should not receive judicial approval. The respondent judge committed a grave abuse of discretion in allowing the Republic of the Philippines to take immediate possession of the properties sought to be expropriated.


WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari and prohibition is hereby granted. The order of June 14, 1979 authorizing the Republic of the Philippines to take or enter upon the possession of the properties sought to be condemned is set aside and the respondent Judge is permanently enjoined from taking any further action on Civil Case No. 7001-P, entitled 
""Republic of the Philippines vs. Concepcion Cabarrus Vda. de Santos, etc.""
 except to dismiss said case. 


SO ORDERED.
