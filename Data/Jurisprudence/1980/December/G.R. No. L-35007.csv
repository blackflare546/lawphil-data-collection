The temporary restraining order enjoined the respondent Judge and his agents from implementing or enforcing his orders dated January 27, 1972, February 11, 1972 and April 6, 1972, all issued in Civil Case No. 644 entitled

The respondent Judge issued an order dated January 27, 1972, the dispositive portion of which reads: 






WHEREFORE, for all the foregoing considerations, the petition for preliminary injunction is hereby set for hearing on February 9, 1972, at 9:00 o'clock in the morning, with notice to all parties. In the meantime, and upon posting by the plaintiff of a surety bond in the amount of TEN THOUSAND (P10,000.00) PESOS, which shall be answerable for whatever damage or injury which the defendants may sustain as a consequence of this order, the defendants and their agents, representatives, and all other persons acting in their behalf, are hereby temporarily restrained from preventing, stopping, molesting, or otherwise thwarting the plaintiff and its agents, representatives, laborers or workers, from cutting and removing the amount of logs authorized to be cut and removed from its licensed logging area, and from passing or otherwise using the Bignay and Sumandig-Alulag roads for the purpose. 


Let summons be issued and let the same and this order be served upon the defendants by Deputy Sheriff Benedicto P. Mateo of this Court. 


IT IS SO ORDERED. 


Gapan, Nueva Ecija, January 27, 1972. 


















(SGD) TEOFILO GUADIZ, JR. 				Judge 
6
 






















The plaintiff in Civil Case No. 644, Diosamer Development Corporation, private respondent herein, filed an urgent motion dated February 11, 1972 asking for the clarification of the restraining order.
7
 
On the same date, the respondent Judge issued the following order: 






Acting upon the urgent motion dated February 11, 1972 filed by the plaintiff asking for a clarification about the duration of the effectivity of the temporary restraining order dated January 27, 1972 and of the area where the plaintiff shall be allowed to conduct its logging operations and for the reasons stated therein which appear to be well founded, the Court hereby grants the same and so orders; 


That the restraining order dated January 27, 1972 shall continue to have force and effect until further order from the Court; 


That the area where the plaintiff shall be allowed to cut and remove logs is that licensed area (Annex ""E"") covered by the sketch, Annex 'B-l' of the Complaint as further described in the technical description, Annex 'B-2' of the complaint, notwithstanding the respective conflicting claims of the defendants and the plaintiff that said area is inside or outside the Fort Magsaysay Military reservation as the case may be. 


IT IS SO ORDERED. 


Gapan, Nueva Ecija, February 11, 1972. 
8
 






The petitioners' motion for reconsideration of the restraining order and the clarificatory order was denied in an order dated April 6, 1972 which also directed the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction as prayed for in the verified complaint. 


Hence this petition for certiorari and prohibition. 


The records shows that the principal relief sought by Diosamer Development Corporation in Civil Case No. 644 was for a road-right-of-way through the Fort Magsaysay Military Reservation so that the plaintiff, and its laborers, equipments and trucks could pass through the Bignay and ""Sumandig-Alulag"" roads for its logging operation or allied activities even if said roads may, in some points, traverse the reservation. It appears that the respondent Judge issued the restraining order as well as the order clarifying said restraining order 
ex-parte
 without giving the petitioners a chance to oppose the applications therefor. 


The respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in clarifying the restraining order in the sense that the plaintiff, Diosamer Development Corporation, was allowed to cut and remove logs in its licensed area ""notwithstanding the respective conflicting claims of the defendants and the plaintiff that said area is inside or outside the Fort Magsaysay Military reservation as the case may be"". As a result, the Diosamer Development Corporation was allegedly able to cut timber within portions of the Fort Magsaysay Military Reservation. The clarificatory order went beyond what was prayed for in the complaint. All that the plaintiff was asking was to be allowed to pass through the areas of Fort Magsaysay Military Reservation traversed by the Bignay and ""Sumandig-Alulag"" roads. Indeed the clarificatory order has prejudged the conflict between the Diosamer Development Corporation and the petitioners on whether or not the licensed area of the said corporation included portions of the Fort Magsaysay Military Reservation. This amounted to a decision of the case on the merits in favor of Diosamer Development Corporation. Sound discretion is no license to frustrate the law by defeating its objectives. 
9
 


The order of April 6, 1972 perpetuated the grave abuse of discretion by denying the motion to set aside the order of January 27, 1972 and the order of February 11, 1972. 


WHEREFORE, the petition for 
certiorari 
and prohibition is hereby GRANTED and the restraining order dated January 27, 1972, the clarificatory restraining order dated February 11, 1972 and the order dated April 6, 1972 are set aside, without pronouncement as to costs. 


SO ORDERED.
