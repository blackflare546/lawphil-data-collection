At the arraignment the defendants, Felix Santiago, Norberto Sangabol and Victorino Angeles, pleaded not guilty to the charge. 


On August 4, 1958, after a prosecution witness had testified, the Fiscal moved for the dismissal of the case against Pablo Feliciano in order to utilize him as a witness for the prosecution on the alleged ground that his testimony was absolutely necessary to prove the charge; that otherwise no direct evidence was available; that Pablo Feliciano appeared to be the least guilty and that his testimony could be corroborated in its material aspect. The motion was granted and defendant, Pablo Feliciano, was discharged as an accused over the opposition of the defense.

The defendants, Felix Santiago, Victorino Angeles and Norberto Sangabol appealed to the Court of Appeals which acquitted Felix Santiago and affirmed the conviction of Victorino Angeles and Norberto Sangabol.


The petitioners assigned the following errors:


I




THE RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE DISCHARGE OF PABLO FELICIANO AS STATE WITNESS WAS LEGAL.




II




THE RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE 
CORPUS DELICTI 
WAS ESTABLISHED.




III




THE RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING PETITIONERS. 
5




The issue on the discharge of Pablo Feliciano may no longer be passed upon because it appears from the record that the matter was elevated by the petitioners to this Court which dismissed the petition in a resolution of August 12, 1958 in G.R., No. L-14158. 
6
 


The contention of the petitioners that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming their conviction is meritorious.


The pertinent facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are:




About the year 1958, the Pampanga-Bongabon Irrigation Project had its offices and sphere of operation within the town of Sta. Rosa, Cabanatuan City and part of San Leonardo, Sta. Rosa, Nueva Ecija. Their principal office was located beside the Municipal Building compound located at Sta. Rosa, Nueva Ecija. In said compound were then deposited paraphernalia belonging to the government such as steel bars, cement, gravel, lumber, rails, wires, etc. and the watchman-storekeeper therein at the time was Francisco Regalado, in charge of receiving and releasing construction materials to be used at the irrigation project. He was assisted by a graduate engineer and a general foreman. During the months of September to December. inclusive. 1957 the sub-office at Sta. Rosa, Nueva Ecija received 10,600 pieces of 3"" x 33' steel bars and 5,250 pieces of ½"" x 30' steel bars for use by the aforementioned irrigation project. During these aforementioned months not all these materials had been used so much so that a considerable quantity of same were in store at the sub-office compound aforementtioned, that is, 3,960 of 3"" x 30' steel bars and 3,144 of the ½"" x 30' steel bars were left unused. However, a subsequent check has revealed that 605 of the 3 "" x 30' as well as 857 of the ½"" x 30' steel bars had disappeared. Delfin Garcia, the project engineer, informed of the loss, reported the same to the mayor and both conducted an investigation.


The watchman-storekeeper, Francisco Regalado, testified admitting such loss of the steel bars. One Ernesto Buenviaje testified that in the evening of May 6, 1958, he had driven a truck that carried the supposedly stolen steel bars from the compound of Sta. Rosa to Guimba, Pablo Feliciano, one of the witnesses investigated, had pointed at defendant Norberto Sangabol as having been one of those who had loaded the steel bars to the truck of Pedro Palcone — which steel bars had allegedly been taken to the store of Ong Sy Pharma Industries Inc. and when the investigator proceeded there they had actually recovered 143 pieces of the ½"" x 30' steel bars and 60 pieces of the 3"" x 30' steel bars. 
7


The evidence of the prosecution shows that it was only after twenty-three (23) days from May 6, 1958 that the alleged theft was discovered when an inventory of the steel bars was taken. Considering that the iron bars allegedly stolen consisted of 605 pieces of 3/8"" x 30' and 857 pieces of ½"" x 30', it is incredible that said steel bars were not passed immediately. The watchman-storekeeper, Francisco Regalado, should have discovered immediately the loss of said bars. It is, therefore, highly improbable that a total of 1,462 pieces of steel bars could have been stolen in the evening of May 6, 1958.


On motion of the prosecution, the accused, Pablo Feliciano, was discharged to be utilized a state witness. It is to be presumed that without the testimony of said accused, the prosecution could not establish the guilt of the remaining accused with proof beyond reasonable doubt.


If the testimony of Pablo Feliciano is to be given credence, it was the accused Chief of Police of Sta. Rosa, Felix Santiago, who was the mastermind of the theft of the steel bars. Pablo Feliciano declared that on May 6, 1958, Chief of Police Felix Santiago told Pablo Feliciano to Ernesto Buenviaje, a driver of a truck; that it was Chief of Police Felix Santiago who procured the truck which was in transporting the stolen iron bars to the warehouse of the China man in Guimba; that Chief of Police Felix Santiago even provided the battery for the truck; and that about 1:00 o'clock on May 7, 1958, the accused, Victorino Angeles, allegedly gave Pablo Feliciano in the presence of Chief of Police Felix Santiago the amount of P20.00 in payment of the services of Pablo Feliciano in loading the steel bars.

On motion for reconsideration, the majority of the division of five of the Court of Appeals acquitted the accused Chief of Police Felix Santiago. It is noteworthy that Justice Hermogenes Concepcion Jr., who is from Nueva Ecija, now a member of this Court, maintained his vote to acquit all the accused.


If, from the testimony of Pablo Feliciano, the accused Chief of Police Felix Santiago was the mastermind it is strange why the accused Victorino Angeles, who was merely the watchman in the irrigation office, was convicted as principal of the crime of qualified theft and the accused, Norberto Sangabol, who was only a bystander, was convicted as accomplice of the crime of theft.


The information alleges that 857 pieces of 3/8 "" x 30' of reinforcing steel bars and 605 pieces of ½"" x 30' concrete forcing steel bars were stolen on May 6, 1958. The total of 1,462 concrete reinforcing steel bars must have weighed several tons. It is physically impossible for this quantity of concrete reinforcing steel bars to be loaded in one car. 


The accused, Pablo Feliciano, turned state witness, testified that twelve (12) bundles of iron bars were loaded on the truck and that one (1) bundle had a diameter of about four (4) inches. The pertinent portion of his testimony reads:








Q 	How many iron bars did you load if you know into the truck? 


A 	More or less 12 bundles. 


Q 	Do you know how many pieces are there in one bundle? 


A 	I do not know.


Q 	How big is a bundle? Will you please demonstrate by your hands?


A 	Witness indicating a diameter of four inches. 
10








If the twelve (12) bundles were tied together, the total diameter could be about 48 inches or 4 feet. The twelve (12) bundles must have had the diameter of a little over one (1) meter. 


The evidence of the prosecution also shows that the loading took about three hours from 11:00 o'clock in the evening of May 6, 1958 to 2:00 o'clock in the morning of May 7, 1958. The truck which was being loaded was about 7 meters from the municipal building of Sta. Rosa. At about 10:00 o'clock in the evening of May 6, 1958, there were many policemen in the municipal building according to the accused turned state witness, Pablo Feliciano, because of a robbery that had just taken place in Sta. Rosa. It is to be presumed that when the alleged loading of the iron bars commenced at 11:00 o'clock in the evening of May 6, 1958, there were still policemen inside the municipal building. And even after most of the policemen had gone, certainly, some policemen would have remained in the municipal building as guards. It is, therefore, highly incredible that the 1,462 steel bars consisting of 12 bundles could have been loaded during a period of three hours without having been noticed by the policemen on guard in the municipal building. There is evidence that there were several persons in the irrigation office. It is again surprising why none of these persons inside the irrigation office noticed the alleged loading of the iron bars on the truck.


The prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that petitioners participated in any manner in the alleged theft of 1,462 steel bars on May 6, 1958.


In view of the foregoing, there is no basis to affirm the conviction of Victorino Angeles as principal of the crime of qualified theft and of Norberto Sangabol as accomplice of the crime of simple theft.


WHEREFORE, the decision of the Court of Appeals sought to be reviewed is hereby REVERSED and the petitioners are ACQUITTED of the crime charged in the amended information, with costs
