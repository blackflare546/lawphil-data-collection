She conducted three eliminations; microscopic examination, the duguenoi levine test and thirdly, the confirmatory examination of thin layer chromatographic test. The said specimen was submitted to them by OIC Danilo Santiago, a representative of the CANU, Olongapo City.

His job then was among other things to follow up reports in their office, recover stolen items and apprehend suspects. On July 21,1981, he was on Detached Service with the ANTI-NARCOTICS Unit; and that on that date, he came from Baguio City and arrived in Olongapo City at about 1:30 o'clock in the afternoon having left Baguio at about 8:30 o'clock in the morning. He took the Victory Liner in going back to Olongapo City. His family lives in Baguio City. On board the Victory Liner, he was seated on the second seat at the back. While he was thus seated, suspect Anita Claudio boarded the same bus and took the seat in front of him after putting a bag which she was carrying at the back of the seat of Obiña. The bag placed by suspect behind his seat was a wooven buri bag made of plastic containing some vegetables. The act of the accused putting her bag behind Pat. Obiña's seat aroused his suspicion and made him felt (sic) nervous. With the feeling that there was some unusual, he had the urge to search the woven plastic bag. But it was only at San Fernando, Pampanga when he was able to go to the bag. He inserted one of his fingers in a plastic bag located at the bottom of the woven bag and smelt marijuana. The plastic woven bag appearing to contain camote tops on the top has a big bundle of plastic of marijuana at the bottom. He could recognize the smell of marijuana because he was assigned at that time at the ANTI-NARCOTICS Unit. He did not, however, do anything after he discovered that there was marijuana inside the plastic bag of the accused until they reached Olongapo City and the accused alighted from the bus in front of the Caltex Gasoline Station in Sta. Rita. Right after the accused alighted from the bus, policeman Obina intercepted her and showed her his Id Identifying himself as a policeman and told her he will search her bag because of the suspicion that she was carrying marijuana inside said bag. In reply, accused told him, ""Please go with me, let us settle this at home.""

At the police headquarters Investigation Section, the bag was searched in the presence of Investigator Cpl. Tiongco; Pat. Obiña, the accused and Sgt. Leoncio Bagang. Inside the plastic bag was found a big bundle of plastic containing marijuana weighing about one kilo. Witness stated that he could detect marijuana even before the application of chemicals because of one year and a half assignment with the CANU. After the marijuana was taken from the bag of the accused, photographs were taken of the accused and the marijuana confiscated from her possession with Pat. Obiña and that of Investigator Tiongco, accused and himself Identified photographs shown to him in open Court. (Exhs. ""D,"" ""D-l,"" ""D-2"" and ""D-3""). Witness was likewise shown a plastic bag of marijuana contained in a plastic container (Exhs. ""B,"" ""B-1"" and ""B-1 -a"") and Identified it as the one confiscated from the accused and pointed to his initials on the newspaper wrapping which also shows the date and time, although the wrapper at the time he testified appeared to be soiled already. The marijuana was allegedly still fresh when confiscated. 


To prove further that the accused transported the confiscated marijuana from Baguio City to Olongapo City, witness Identified Victory Liner Ticket No. 684977 which was confiscated from the accused and for Identification purposes, the witness presented the body number of the bus he wrote at the back of the ticket which is ""309"" (Exhs. ""F"" and ""F-l""). Regarding himself, he did not pay his fare from Baguio City because as a policeman, he used his badge and a free ride.

Witness inserted one of his fingers inside the buri bag and thereafter smelt marijuana. He confirmed his testimony on direct that when witness confronted accused he was invited to go with her in order to settle the matter to which he refused. Accused further testified that from the time the accused placed her bag behind his seat from Baguio City, he felt so nervous and had to take his medicine at the Tarlac Station. It was only after having taken his medicine that his apprehension was contained and thus was able to insert his right hand inside the buri bag in San Fernando, Pampanga. His fingers reached the very bottom of the bag. He Identified his sworn statement regarding this incident given on July 21, 1981 which is Exhibit ""G."" Witness likewise Identified accused Anita Claudio in open court. 


Paulino Tiongco, 52 years old, married and resident of 31 Canada St., East Bajac Bajac, Olongapo City, testified that as a policeman on the afternoon of July 21, 1981, he was inside the Investigation Division of the Police Station, Olongapo City. As Duty Investigator, between 1:45 and 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, Pat.

However, in 1981, he was already assigned to the CANU General Anti-NARCOTICS Unit. On July 22, 1981, he reported for work at the CANU and received from Lt. Galindo more than a kilo of suspected marijuana dried leaves. As requested by Lt. Galindo he conducted a field test on this marijuana which he received from Lt.

He narrated that on July 21,1981, between the hours of 1:00 and 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, he was at the Caltex Gasoline Station, East Bajac Bajac, Olongapo City along Rizal Avenue. He was then on duty patrol using a motorcycle. While he was at the said place, he saw Pat. Obiña alighted from the Victory Liner bus ordering somebody to alight from the same bus. When he heard Pat.

DO which is an initial, and not a signature, stands for Daniel Obiña. After the testimony of Leoncio Bagang, the prosecution rested its case. (Rollo, pp. 42-47)




Accused Claudio raised the following assignments of errors in this appeal:




I


CONVICTION UNDER SECTION 4, ART. II OF R.A. 6425 IS IMPROPER IF ONE OR SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENSE IS OR ARE ABSENT.


II


CONVICTION CAN NOT BE HAD UNDER SECTION 4, ART. II OF R.A. 6425 IF THE ALLEGED BUYMAN WAS NOT PRESENTED TO TESTIFY.


III


APPELLANTS CONVICTION FOR DELIVERY (SEC. 4, ART II, OF R.A. 6424) IS WRONG BECAUSE SOME MATERIAL FACTS WERE OVERLOOKED AND NOT CONSIDERED IN FAVOR OF APPELLANT. (Rollo, p. 91)




The accused alleges that she is only liable, at the most, for possession under Sec. 8, Art. II of Rep. Act No. 6425 and not for violating Sec. 4 of the same Act. 


The latter section, Sec. 4 provides:




Sec. 4.
	Sale, Administration, Delivery Distribution and Transportation of Prohibited Drugs
.—The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from twenty thousand to thirty thousand pesos shall be imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, administer, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any prohibited drug, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions. If the victim of the offense is a minor, or should a prohibited drug involved in any offense under this Section be the proximate cause of the death of a victim thereof, the maximum penalty herein provided shall be imposed.




Claudio contends that there was no delivery as there was no recipient of the prohibited drugs. Therefore, she may not be convicted under Sec. 4 of Rep. Act No. 6425. 


The contention is without merit. A closer perusal of the subject provision shows that it is not only delivery which is penalized but also the sale, administration, distribution and 
transportation
 of probihited drugs. Claudio was caught transporting 1.1 kilos of marijuana, thus the lower court did not err in finding her guilty of violating Sec. 4. 


The accused also alleges that before the completion of delivery, the intention of the possessor is unknown. 


This allegation is also unavailing. It is undisputed that Claudio had in her possession 1.1 kilos of marijuana. This is a considerable quantity. As held in the case of 
People v. Toledo
, (140 SCRA 259, 267) ""the possession of such considerable quantity as three plastic bags of marijuana leaves and seeds coupled with the fact that he is not a user of prohibited drugs cannot indicate anything except the intention of the accused to sell, distribute and deliver said marijuana. 


The accused next contends the warrantless search, seizure and apprehension as unlawful. 


The applicable provisions on this issue are found in the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure. 


Rule 113, Sec. 5(a) of the said Rules provides:




.. A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person: 


(a)	When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense. 


xxx			xxx			xxx




Meanwhile, its Rule 126, Sec. 12 provides:




Section 12. 	
Search incident to lawful arrest
.— A person lawfully arrested may be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may be used as proof of the commission of an offense, without a search warrant. (12a)




Appellant Claudio was caught transporting prohibited drugs. Pat. Daniel Obiña did not need a warrant to arrest Claudio as the latter was caught in flagrante delicto. The warrantless search being an incident to a lawful arrest is in itself lawful. (Nolasco v. Pano, 147 SCRA 509). Therefore, there was no infirmity in the seizure of the 1.1 kilos of marijuana. 


The accused takes inconsistent positions in her appellant's brief. At first, she does not deny having had with her marijuana at the time of her arrest. Instead, she claims that she should just be guilty of possession. In a complete turnabout, in the latter portion of said brief, she claims that the evidence against her were mere fabrications and the marijuana allegedly found in her possession was only planted. 


We have carefully examined the records of the case and we find no ground to alter the trial court's findings and appreciation of the evidence presented. 


Credence is accorded to the prosecution's evidence, more so as it consisted mainly of testimonies of policemen. Law enforcers are presumed to have regularly performed their duty in the absence of proof to the contrary (People v. De Jesus, 145 SCRA 521). We also find no reason from the records why the prosecution witnesses should fabricate their testimonies and implicate appellant in such a serious crime (See People v. Bautista, 147 SCRA 500). 


The accused testified that she was not on that bus that came from Baguio City but rather she was in Olongapo City all that time. She alleged that she was arrested by Pat. Obiña for no reason at all. 


In the case at bar, alibi does not deserve much credit as it was established only by the accused herself (People v. De la Cruz, 148 SCRA 582). 


Moreover, it is a well-established rule that alibi cannot prevail over positive testimony (People v. De La Cruz, 
supra
). 


WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED. 


SO ORDERED.
