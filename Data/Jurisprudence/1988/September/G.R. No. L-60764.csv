The evidence for the prosecution is summarized in the trial court's decision, as follows — 






At around midnight of August 6, 1980, Francisco Roque, nicknamed Frankie, and his ten-year old son, Riel Roque, went to the store of Flavio Cartin which was near the Caltex gasoline station at C. Padilla Street, Cebu City. Francisco Roque had asked Flavio Cartin's wife, Menang to sell him some pieces of mosquito repellant, commonly known as ""Katol,"" on credit. Menang having turned down his request, Francisco Roque, obviously having taken a drink too many, tore at mosquito repellant and cigarettes on display like a mad dog, because of shame and humiliation. Menang's reaction was to call for his son-in-law, Roberto Bardon the latter having been working overtime trying to fix the engine of the passenger jeepney, a Ford Fiera of Jesus Go, the Mobil Station proprietor Roberto Bardon a lumbering hulk of a man, a heavy-weight so to speak, went to the store and saw to it that Francisco Roque would do no further mischief. Indeed, Francisco Roque, seeing in the midst of his inebriation what seemed to him to be the so-called incredible hulk, retreated from Roberto Bardon. Before he ran away, however, he shouted and gave the owner of the store the impression that he would go back (and create further trouble). 


Francisco Roque and Riel Roque, (then left towards their home), a shanty at the back of creek by the side of the Jai Alai de Cebu. Just as they reached the corner of Rizal Avenue and Fatima Street, the Ford Fiera of Jesus Go which Roberto Bardon was filing caught up with them. It was the accused Roberto Bardon who was driving the vehicle and, as soon as he was able to bring the vehicle to a stop near his quarry, he stepped down together with five or six companions and he himself was armed with an ax, a knife and stones. The accused Roberto Bardon felled Francisco Roque with the ax, while one companion, using the knife stabbed the victim. The rest of the attackers used stones. Perhaps resigned to the fate in store for him, Francisco Roque only concemed himself with Riel's safety. Twice he shouted, ""Run, Riel, run,"" while he struggled hopelessly against certain and inevitable annihilation. Riel Roque ran and hid behind plants and hedges at the side of the street. 


Their purpose having been accomplished, Roberto Bardon and his companion went back to the place from where they came. After they left, Riel, the young boy, went home but, afraid that the danger to his life still subsisted, he slept at the Jai Alai de Cebu. The next day, he reported the matter to his aunt Nena."" (pp. 4-5, Decision). 


Police Officer David Villanueva, Arturo Bantiros and Roy Jumaoas members of the intelligence & Investigation Section of the Southern Police Precinct (Station III), were, at 12:30 a.m., August 7, 1980, alerted by a report that the lifeless body of a person, obviously hacked, stabbed and mauled, may be seen at or near the corner of Rizal Avenue (South Expressway) and Fatima Street, Cebu City. 


Responding to the call, the police officers aforesaid found the deceased body of a person who was later Identified by witnesses and relatives to be Francisco Roque, 32 years of age, widower, a laborer and a resident of 533 C. Padilla Street, Cebu City.

(pp. 1-2,
 Ibid
; pp. 3-6, Brief for the Appellee; pp. 260-263, Rollo). 






On the other hand, the defense gave the following version: 






The defense is one of complete denial of the charge, the accused Roberto Bardon alleging that it was his father-in-law, Flavio Cartin, who drove a motor vehicle in order to go after Francisco Roque, while he was at the Mobil Gas Station fixing the Ford Fiera of Jesus Go. He worked on the Go Ford Fiera until 3:00 o'clock dawn because Jesus Go wanted to use the jeep for passenger service at 4:00 A.M.


Flavio Cartin escaped the clutches of the law, and, while his coaccused proposed that he, too, should flee because the dismissed information will be reinstated, the accused Bardon refused to escape with them because he believed himself innocent. 


He denied that he dictated Exhibit ""C"" to the police and, quite surprisingly, he renounced the affidavit, Exhibit ""B"", although the same was prepared by his former lawyer, Atty. Crispin Menchavez. This very affidavit, Exhibit ""B"" was meant by his lawyer to be an affidavit of retraction of his verbal confession and as a counter-affidavit for purposes of the preliminary investigation. He claims that this was forced on him by his said lawyer. The contents of Exhibit ""B"" he denounced (as) untrue, notwithstanding the fact that he swore to its truthfulness before Assistant City Fiscal Catalino Paz. 


In his open court testimony, the accused did not deny that, at the time Francisco Roque created trouble in the store of his mother-in-law, he was called upon to subdue the drunken troublemaker. He now avers that, after he talked to Francisco Roque, this supposed vandal left his mother-in-law law's store without issue. 


Thirty minutes, afterwards, however, his mother-in-law again called for him in order to request him to follow his father-in-law, Flavio Cartin, the latter having taken off after Francisco Roque. ""This last command he refused to obey, because he was busy fixing the engine of the Ford Feira Even as of that time, the Ford Fiera was allegedly not in running condition as yet. 


On further examination, the accused, perhaps forgetting this averment gave Us to understand that, by the simple expedient of putting back the spark plugs which he removed for cleaning, the vehicle could still have run on its own power. (pp. 8-9, Decision; pp. 16-17, Rollo) 






The principal question as in most criminal cases, is, the credibility of witnesses. A review of the records of the case, however, shows that the evidence undoubtedly supports the findings and conclusions of the trial court in its judgment of conviction. 


Through the testimony of witness Riel Roque, the 10-year old son of the victim, it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that appellant was the one who hacked Francisco Roque with an axe on the latter's back. 


Riel Roque's testimony runs thus — 










ATTY. VILLORDON (on direct examination)

(pp. 9-11, tsn, July 8, 1981; pp. 8-10, Brief for the Appellee; pp. 265-267, Rollo). 


Appellant faults the trial court for giving credence to the testimony of Riel Roque. According to appellant Riel Roque's testimony cannot be given credence because ""he is not an eyewitness, his testimony refers to post-facto events and hearsay matters"" (Rollo, p. 113). Moreover, Riel Roque's testimony is full of flaws and inconsistencies. (Rollo, p. 118) For instance, appellant contends that Riel Roque contradicted himself on the following: 






(a) 	When he (Riel Roque) stated that his father was stabbed first across the abdomen towards the left chest and then towards the right chest but ""in the same breath"" he stated that it was appellant who struck his father first with an ax (pp. 10-12, tsn, July 8, 1981). 


(b)	 When first asked what part of the body of his father was hit by the ax, Riel said he did not clearly see and that all he can say is that appellant was bringing an ax. When asked by the trial court, however, he categorically stated that appellant hit his father with an ax at the back (p. 11,
 Ibid
). 


(pp. 17-18, Brief for the Appellee; pp. 274-275, Rollo). 






Such inconsistencies are trivial and unimportant. They do not militate against the witness' credibility. The more important thing is, appellant was positively identified as the one who, together with companions, inflicted bodily injuries on the victim, causing said victim to suffer a fatal wound which caused his death. Riel could not be mistaken in his identification of the appellant because (1) they had been neighbors before (p. 14, tsn, July 8, 1981); (2) immediately before the incident, appellant had been seen by Riel in the store of Minang Carten (p. 10, 
Ibid
); and (3) at the scene of the incident, he saw appellant stop the Ford Fiera he was driving, alight from it and leave it ""with the engine still running,"" (p. 20, 
Ibid
) indicating that the head lights of the vehicle illuminated the place of the crime. Besides, appellant failed to show any reason or improper motive on the part of Riel Roque, a 10-year old boy, to falsely testify against him. 


The case of the prosecution was further strengthened by the following:


(1)	The necropsy report (Exh. ""A"") of Dr. Jesus Cema, who conducted the autopsy of the cadaver of the victim, is corroborative of the testimony of Riel Roque that appellant hacked the victim with an ax, hitting the latter on his back (Wound No. 3, Exh. ""A""). 


(2)	Cornelia Pila testified that at around 11:30 o'clock in the evening of August 6, 1980, the deceased Francisco Roque and his son, Riel, had first gone to her store. They transferred to the store of Minang Carten to buy mosquito repellant on credit. Not long after that, she heard Minang Carten calling for appellant because the deceased was causing her trouble. Minang Carten told appellant to hold and strike the deceased. Before appellant could strike the deceased, the latter and his son went away. Then she saw appellant, Minang Carten and her husband, have a conversation. Moments later, appellant proceeded to the Mobil station and drove the yellow Ford Fiera towards Fatima Street. (pp. 11-12, tsn, July 9, 1981; pp. 269270, Rollo). 


As against the positive, clear, convincing and corroborated testimony of the prosecution witnesses, appellant offers ""alibi"" as a defense. He claims that at the time of the incident, he was at the Mobil Gas Station fixing the Ford Fiera of Jesus Go. He worked on the Ford Fiera until 3:00 dawn because Jesus Go wanted to use the jeep for passenger service at 4:00 A.M. (p. 8, Decision). 


Appellant's defense cannot be sustained. It is settled that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of appellant by credible witnesses. (People v. Dumlao, 125 SCRA 822, People v. Salig 133 SCRA 59). 


The trial court, however, erred in the imposition of the correct penalty. It considered the aggravating circumstances of nighttime, abuse of superior strength and use of a motor vehicle. We have already ruled that nighttime and abuse of superior strength are inherent in treachery and cannot be appreciated separately. (People v. Ramillano 133 SCRA 201, 214). The aggravating circumstance of the use of a motor vehicle was, however, correctly appreciated by the trial court. The Ford Fiera played an important role in the accomplishment of appellant's design. Not only that, appellant and his companions made good their escape by speeding away in the jeep in order to avoid discovery of their identities. 


There is no dispute that the crime was attended by two (2) mitigating circumstances of sufficient provocation and passion and obfuscation.


With the abolition on the death penalty, the penalty now imposed by law for the crime of murder is 
reclusion temporal
 in its maximum period to
 reclusion perpetua. 


With one aggravating circumstance and two mitigating circumstances the net effect is for the case to have one mitigating circumstance and the imposable penalty will be the minimum period of the penalty provided by law with the abolition of the death penalty (namely, 
reclusion temporal
 in its maximum period to
 reclusion perpetua
.

WHEREFORE, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law,

 the accused is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment from ten (10) years and one (1) day of
 prision mayor
 as minimum to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of

SO ORDERED.
