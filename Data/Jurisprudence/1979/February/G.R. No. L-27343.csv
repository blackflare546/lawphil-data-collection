Saldajeno and her husband Cecilio Saldajeno, Leon Garibay, Timoteo Tubungbanua and the Provincial Sheriff of Negros Occidental a complaint the prayer of which reads: 






WHEREFORE, the plaintiffs respectfully pray:


(1)	That a writ of preliminary injunction be issued restraining the defendant Provincial Sheriff of Negros Occidental from proceeding with the sales at public auction that he advertised in two notices issued by him on May 18, 1959 in connection with Civil Case No. 5223 of this Honorable Court, until further orders of this Court; and to make said injunction permanent after hearing on the merits:

(5)	That the defendant Leon Garibay, Timoteo Tubungbanua, and Margarita G.

(6)	The plaintiffs further pray for all other remedies to which the Honorable Court will find them entitled to, with costs to the defendants.


Bacolod City, June 4, 1959.

The action was docketed as Civil Case No. 5343 of said court.


In their amended answer, the defendants Margarita G. Saldajeno and her husband, Cecilio Saldajeno, alleged the following special and affirmative defenses:






xxx 			xxx			xxx


2.	That the defendant Isabela Sawmill has been dissolved by virtue of an action entitled ""In the matter of: Dissolution of Isabela Sawmill as partnership, etc. 
Margarita G. Saldajeno et al. vs. Isabela Sawmill, et al.
, Civil Case No. 4787, Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental;


3.	That as a result of the said dissolution and the decision of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental in the aforesaid case, the other defendants herein Messrs. Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua became the successors-in-interest to the said defunct partnership and have bound themselves to answere for any and all obligations of the defunct partnership to its creditors and third persons;


4.	That to secure the performance of the obligations of the other defendants Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua to the answering defendant herein, the former have constituted a chattel mortgage over the properties mentioned in the annexes to that instrument entitled ""Assignment of Rights with Chattel Mortgage"" entered into on May 26, 1968 and duly registered in the Register of Deeds of Negros Occidental on the same date:


5.	That all the plaintiffs herein, with the exceptionof the plaintiff Oppen, Esteban, Inc. are creditors of Messrs. Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua and not of the defunct Isabela Sawmill and as such they have no cause of action against answering defendant herein and the defendant Isabela Sawmill;


6.	That all the plaintiffs herein, except for the plaintiff Oppen, Esteban, Inc. granted cash advances, gasoline, crude oil, motor oil, grease, rice and nipa to the defendants Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua with the knowledge and notice that the Isabela Sawmill as a former partnership of defendants Margarita G. Isabela Sawmill as a former partnership of defendants Margarita G. Saldajeno, Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua, has already been dissolved;


7.	That this Honorable Court has no jurisdictionover the claims of the plaintiffs Oppen, Esteban, Inc., Agustin R. Tonsay, Jose L. Espinos, and the Bacolod Southern Lumber Yard, it appearing that the amounts sought to be recovered by them in this action is less than P2,000.00 each, exclusive of interests;


8.	That in so far as the claims of these alleged creditors plaintiffs are concerned, there is a misjoinder of parties because this is not a class suit, and therefore this Honorable Court cannot take jurisdictionof the claims for payment;


9.	That the claims of plaintiffs-creditors, except Oppen, Esteban, Inc. go beyond the limit mentioned inthe statute of frauds, Art. 1403 of the Civil Code, and are therefor unenforceable, even assuming that there were such credits and claims;


10.	That this Honorable Court has no jurisdiction in this case for it is well settled in law and in jurisprudence that a court of first instance has no power or jurisdiction to annul judgments or decrees of a coordinate court because other function devolves upon the proper appellate court; (Lacuna, et al. vs. Ofilada, et al., G.R. No. L-13548, September 30, 1959; Cabigao vs. del Rosario, 44 Phil. 182; PNB vs. Javellana, 49 O.G. No. 1, p.124), as it appears from the complaint in this case to annul the decision of this same court, but of another branch (Branch II, Judge Querubin presiding).

Said defendants interposed a cross-claim against the defendsants Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua praying ""that in the event that judgment be rendered ordering defendant cross claimant to pay to the plaintiffs the amount claimed in the latter's complaint, that the cross claimant whatever amount is paid by the latter to the plaintiff in accordance to the said judgment. ...

11.	The plaintiffs and the defendants Cecilio Saldajeno and Margarita G. Saldajeno reserve the right to present additional evidence at the hearing of this case.






Forming parts of the above copied stipulation are documents that were marked as Appendices ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""C-1"", ""C-2"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F"", ""F-1"", ""G"", ""G-1"", ""H"", and ""I"".


The plaintiffs and the defendants Cecilio and Margarita G. Saldajeno presented additional evidence, mostly documentary, while the cross-defendants did not present any evidence. The case hardly involves quetions of fact at all, but only questions of law.


The fact that the defendnat 'Isabela Sawmill' is indebted to theplaintiff Oppen, Esteban, Inc. in the amount of P1,288.89 as the unpaid balance of an obligation of P20,500.00 contracted on February 3, 10956 is expressly admitted in paragraph 2 and 3 of the Stipulation, Exh. ""A"" and its Appendices ""B"", ""C"", ""C-1"", and ""C-2"".


The plaintiff Agustin E. Tonssay proved by his own testimony and his Exhs. ""B"" to""G"" that from October 6, 1958 to November 8, 1958 he advanced a total of P4,200.00 to the defendant 'Isabela Sawmill'. Agaist the said advances said defendant delivered to Tonsay P3,266.27 worth of lumber, leavng an unpaid balance of P933.73, which balance was confirmed on May 15, 1959 by the defendant Leon Garibay, as Manager of the defendant partnership.


The plaintiff Manuel G. Singsong proved by his own testimony and by his Exhs. ""J"" to ""L"" that from May 25, 1988 to January 13, 1959 he sold on credit to the defendnat ""Isabela Sawmill"" rice and bran, on account of which business transaction there remains an unpaid balance of P3,580.50. The same plaintiff also proved that the partnership ownes him the sum of P143.00 for nipa shingles bought from him on credit and unpaid for.


The plaintiff Jose L. Espinos proved through the testimony of his witness Cayetano Palmares and his Exhs. ""N"" to ""O-3"" that he owns the ""Guia Lumber Yard"", that on October 11, 1958 said lumber yard advanced the sum of P2,500.00 to the defendant ""Isabela Sawmill"", that against the said cash advance, the defendant partnership delivered to Guia Lumber Yard P920.56 worth of lumber, leaving an outstanding balance of P1,579.44.


The plaintiff Bacolod Southern Lumber Yard proved through the testimony of the witness Cayetano Palmares an its Exhs. ""P"" to ""Q-1"" that on October 11, 1958 said plaintiff advanced the sum of P1,500.00 to the defendsant 'Isabela Sawmill', that against the said cash advance, the defendant partnership delivered to the said plaintiff on November 19, 1958 P377.72 worth of lumber, and P73.54 worth of lumber on January 27, 1959, leaving an outstanding balance of P1,048.78.

Saldajeno for P38,040.00 the assets of the defendsant ""Isabela Sawmill"" which the defendants Leon G. Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua had mortgaged to her, and said purchase price was applied to the judgment that she has obtained against he said mortgagors in Civil Case No. 5223 of this Court.


Appendix ""I"" of the same stipulation Exh. ""A"" shows that on October 20, 1959 the defendant Margarita G. Saldajeno sold to the PAN ORIENTAL LUMBER COMPANY for P45,000.00 part of the said properties that she had bought at public aucton one week before.

It is contended by the appellants that the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental had no jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 5343 because the plaintiffs Oppen, Esteban, Inc., Agustin R. Tonsay, Jose L. Espinos and the Bacolod Southern Lumber Yard sought to collect sums of moeny, the biggest amount of which was less than P2,000.00 and, therefore, within the jurisdiction of the municipal court.


This contention is devoid of merit because all the plaintiffs also asked for the nullity of the assignment of right with chattel mortgage entered into by and between Margarita G. Saldajeno and her former partners Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua. This cause of action is not capable of pecuniary estimation and falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instnace. Where the basic issue is something more than the right to recover a sum of money and where the money claim is purely incidental to or a consequence of the principal relief sought, the action is as a case where the subject of the litigation is not capable of pecuniary estimation and is cognizable exclusively by the Court of First Instance.


The jurisdiction of all courts in the Philippines, in so far as the authority thereof depends upon the nature of litigation, is defined in the amended Judiciary Act, pursuant to which courts of first instance shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over any case the subject matter of which is not capable of pecuniary estimation. An action for the annulment of a judgment and an order of a court of justice belongs to th category.
8
 


In determining whether an action is one the subject matter of which is not capable of pecuniary estimation this Court has adopted the criterion of first ascertaining the nature of the principal action or remedy sought. If it is primarily for the recovery of a sum of money, the cliam is considered capable of pecuniary estimation, and whether jurisdiciton is in the municipal courts or in the courts of first instance would depend on the amount of the claim. However, where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, where the money claim is purely incidental to, or a consequence of, the principal relief sought, this Court has considered such actions as cases where the subject ogf the litigation may not be estimated in terms of money, and are cognizable exclusively by courts of first instance.


In 
Andres Lapitan vs. SCANDIA, Inc., et al
.,
9
 
this Court held:






Actions for specific performance of contracts have been expressly prounounced to be exclusively cognizable by courts of first instance: 
De Jesus vs. Judge Garcia
, L-26816, February 28, 1967; 
Manufacturers' Distributors, Inc. vs. Yu Siu Liong
, L-21285, April 29, 1966. And no cogent reason appears, and none is here advanced by the parties, why an actin for rescission (or resolution) should be differently treated, a ""rescission"" being a counterpart, so to speak, of ""specific performance'. In both cases, the court would certainly have to undertake an investigation into facts that would justify one act of the other. No award for damages may be had in an action for resicssion without first conducting an inquiry into matters which would justify the setting aside of a contract, in the same manner that courts of first instance would have to make findings of fact and law in actions not capable of pecuniary estimnation espressly held to be so by this Court, arising from issues like those arised in Arroz v. Alojado, et al., L-22153, March 31, 1967 (the legality or illegality of the conveyance sought for and the determination of the validity of the money deposit made); 
De Ursua v. Pelayo
, L-13285, April 18, 1950 (validity of a judgment); 
Bunayog v. Tunas
, L-12707, December 23, 1959 (validity of a mortgage); 
Baito v. Sarmiento
, L-13105, August 25, 1960 (the relations of the parties, the right to support created by the relation, etc., in actions for support); 
De Rivera, et al. v. Halili
, L-15159, September 30, 1963 (the validity or nullity of documents upon which claims are predicated). Issues of the same nature may be raised by a party against whom an action for rescission has been brought, or by the plaintiff himself. It is, therefore, difficult to see why a prayer for damages in an action for rescission should be taken as the basis for concluding such action for resiccison should be taken as the basis for concluding such action as one cpable of pecuniary estimation - a prayer which must be included in the main action if plaintiff is to be compensated for what he may have suffered as a result of the breach committed by defendant, and not later on precluded from recovering damages by the rule against splitting a cause of action and discouraging multiplicitly of suits.






The foregoing doctrine was reiterated in 
The Good Development Corporation vs. Tutaan
, 
10
 
where this Court held:






On the issue of which court has jurisdiction, the case of 
SENO vs. Pastolante, et al.
, is in point. It was ruled therein that although the purposes of an action is to recover an amount plus interest which comes within the original jurisidction of the Justice of the Peace Court, yet when said action involves the foreclosure of a chattel mortgage covering personal properties valued at more than P2,000, (now P10,000.00) the action should be instituted before the Court of First Instance.


In the instanct, case, the action is to recover the amount of P1,520.00 plus interest and costs, and involves the foreclosure of a chattel mortgage of personal properties valued at P15,340.00, so that it is clearly within the competence of the respondent court to try and resolve.






In the light of the foregoing recent rulings, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental did no err in exercising jurisidction over Civil Case No. 5343.


The appellants also contend that the chattel mortgage may no longer be annulled because it had been judicially approved in Civil Case No. 4797 of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental and said chattel mortgage had been ordered foreclosed in Civil Case No. 5223 of the same court.


On the question of whether a court may nullify a final judgment of another court of co-equal, concurrent and coordinate jusridiction, this Court originally ruled that:






A court has no power to interfere with the judgments or decrees of a court of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction having equal power to grant the relief sought by the injunction.


The various branches of the Court of First Instance of Manila are in a sense coordinate courts and cannot be allowed to interfere with each others' judgments or decrees. 
11
 






The foregoing doctrine was reiterated in a 1953 case 
12
 
where this Court said:






The rule which prohibits a Judge from intertering with the actuations of the Judge of another branch of the same court is not infringed when the Judge who modifies or annuls the order isued by the other Judge acts in the same case and belongs to the same court (Eleazar vs. Zandueta, 48 Phil. 193. But the rule is infringed when the Judge of a branch of the court issues a writ of preliminary injunction in a case to enjoint the sheriff from carrying out an order by execution issued in another case by the Judge of another branch of the same court. (Cabigao and Izquierdo vs. Del Rosario et al., 44 Phil. 182).






This ruling was maintained in 1967. In 
Mas vs. Dumaraog
, 
13
 
the judgment sought to be annulled was rendered by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo and the action for annullment was filed with the Court of First Instance of Antique, both courts belonging to the same Judicial District. This Court held that:






The power to open, modify or vacant a judgment is not only possessed by but restricted to the court in which the judgment was rendered.






The reason of this Court was:






Pursuant to the policy of judicial stability, the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may not be interfered with by any court concurrrent jurisdiction.






Again, in 1967 this Court ruled that the jurisdiction to annul a judgement of a branch of the court of First Instance belongs solely to the very same branch which rendered the judgement. 
14
 


Two years later, the same doctrine was laid down in the Sterling Investment case.
15
 


In December 1971, however, this court re-examined and reversed its earlier doctrine on the matter. In 
Dupla v. Court of Appeals,
 
16
 
this Tribunal, speaking through Mr. Justice Villamor declared:






... the underlying philosophy expressed in the Dumara-og case, the policy of judicial stability, to the end that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may not be interfered with by any court of concurrent jurisdiction may not be interfered with by any court of concurrent jurisdiciton, this Court feels that this is as good an occasion as any to re-examine the doctrine laid down ...


In an action to annul the judgment of a court, the plaintiff's cause of action springs from the alleged nullity of the judgment based on one ground or another, particularly fraud, which fact affords the plaintiff a right to judicial interference in his behalf. In such a suit the cause of action is entirely different from that in the actgion which grave rise to the judgment sought to be annulled, for a direct attack against a final and executory judgment is not a incidental to, but is the main object of the proceeding. The cause of action in the two cases being distinct and separate from each other, there is no plausible reason why the venue of the action to annul the judgment should necessarily follow the venue of the previous action ...


The present doctrine which postulate that one court or one branch of a court may not annul the judgment of another court or branch, not only opens the door to a violation of Section 2 of Rule 4, (of the Rules of Court) but also limit the opportunity for the application of said rule.


Our conclusion must therefore be that a court of first instance or a branch thereof has the authority and jurisdiction to take cognizance of, and to act in, suit to annul final and executory judgment or order rendered by another court of first instance or by another branch of the same court...






In February 1974 this Court reiterated the ruling in the Dulap case.
17
 


In the light of the latest ruling of the Supreme Court, there is no doubt that one branch of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental can take cognizance of an action to nullify a final judgment of the other two branches of the same court.


It is true that the dissolution of a partnership is caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in the carrying on of the business. 
18
 
However, on dissolution, the partnershop is not terminated but continuous until the winding up to the business. 
19


The remaining partners did not terminate the business of the partnership ""Isabela Sawmill"". Instead of winding up the business of the partnership, they continued the business still in the name of said partnership. It is expressly stipulated in the memorandum-agreement that the remaining partners had constituted themselves as the partnership entity, the ""Isabela Sawmill"". 
20
 


There was no liquidation of the assets of the partnership. The remaining partners, Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua, continued doing the business of the partnership in the name of ""Isabela Sawmill"". They used the properties of said partnership.


The properties mortgaged to Margarita G. Saldajeno by the remaining partners, Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua, belonged to the partnership ""Isabela Sawmill."" The appellant, Margarita G. Saldajeno, was correctly held liable by the trial court because she purchased at public auction the properties of the partnership which were mortgaged to her.


It does not appear that the withdrawal of Margarita G. Saldajeno from the partnership was published in the newspapers. The appellees and the public in general had a right to expect that whatever, credit they extended to Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua doing the business in the name of the partnership ""Isabela Sawmill"" could be enforced against the proeprties of said partnership. The judicial foreclosure of the chattel mortgage executed in favor of Margarita G. Saldajeno did not relieve her from liability to the creditors of the partnership.


The appellant, margrita G. Saldajeno, cannot complain. She is partly to blame for not insisting on the liquidaiton of the assets of the partnership. She even agreed to let Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua continue doing the business of the partnership ""Isabela Sawmill"" by entering into the memorandum-agreement with them.


Although it may be presumed that Margarita G. Saldajeno had action in good faith, the appellees aslo acted in good faith in extending credit to the partnership. Where one of two innocent persons must suffer, that person who gave occasion for the damages to be caused must bear the consequences. Had Margarita G. Saldajeno not entered into the memorandum-agreement allowing Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua to continue doing the business of the aprtnership, the applees would not have been misled into thinking that they were still dealing with the partnership ""Isabela Sawmill"". Under the facts, it is of no moment that technically speaking the partnership ""Isabela Sawmill"" was dissolved by the withdrawal therefrom of Margarita G. Saldajeno. The partnership was not terminated and it continued doping business through the two remaining partners.


The contention of the appellant that the appleees cannot bring an action to annul the chattel mortgage of the propertiesof the partnership executed by Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua in favor of Margarita G. Saldajeno has no merit.


As a rule, a contract cannot be assailed by one who is not a party thereto. However, when a contract prejudices the rights of a third person, he may file an action to annul the contract.


This Court has held that a person, who is not a party obliged principally or subsidiarily under a contract, may exercised an action for nullity of the contract if he is prejudiced in his rights with respect to one of the contracting parties, and can show detriment which would positively result to him from the contract in which he has no intervention. 
21
 


The plaintiffs-appellees were prejudiced in their rights by the execution of the chattel mortgage over the properties of the partnership ""Isabela Sawmill"" in favopr of Margarita G. Saldajeno by the remaining partners, Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua. Hence, said appelees have a right to file the action to nullify the chattel mortgage in question.


The portion of the decision appealed from ordering the appellants to pay attorney's fees to the plaintiffs-appellees cannot be sustained. There is no showing that the appellants displayed a wanton disregard of the rights of the plaintiffs. Indeed, the appellants believed in good faith, albeit erroneously, that they are not liable to pay the claims.


The defendants-appellants have a right to be reimbursed whatever amounts they shall pay the appellees by their co-defendants Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua. In the memorandum-agreement, Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbaun undertook to release Margarita G. Saldajeno from any obligation of ""Isabela Sawmill"" to third persons. 
22
 


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed with the elimination of the portion ordering appellants to pay attorney's fees and with the modification that the defendsants, Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua, should reimburse the defendants-appellants, Margarita G. Saldajeno and her husband Cecilio Saldajeno, whatever they shall pay to the plaintiffs-appellees, without pronouncement as to costs.


SO ORDERED.


Teehankee (Chairman), Makasiar, Guerrero, De Castro and Melencio-Herrera, JJ., concur.
