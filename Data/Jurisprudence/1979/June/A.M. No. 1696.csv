2)	
Failure to Pay Just Debts — 
That respondent is a perennial debtor, who consistently fails to pay his debts; that he is indebted to Sergio Lawan in the amount of P98.35, as evidenced by his signed 
vales
 since 1972 yet; and, that he has not shown the least inclination to pay the same. 
2


3)

4)

Pursuant to the lst Indorsement 
5
 
dated September 7, 1977 issued by this Court thru Justice Lorenzo Relova, then Acting Judicial Consultant, Municipal Judge Moleta filed his comment 
6
 under date of October 10, 1977. 


Respondent in his behalf avers that complaint is a disgruntled litigant, whom he sentenced in Case No. 869 for oral defamation to pay a fine of two hundred pesos (P200.00) and that complainant and his wife, Felicitas B. Lawan, are both teachers who entangled themselves as complainants or accused in various litigations involving. a) grave threats, 
7
 (b) grave oral defamation, 
8
 (c) administrative charge of immorality and serious misconduct in offices 
9
 and, d) libel. 
10


Respondent vehemently denies the charges levelled against him .Point by point he disputes and impugns their veracity thus —


1)	
Delayed judgment — 
Respondent denies having rendered a delayed judgment in the aforesaid criminal case. He contends that while the period he gave to the parties to file their memoranda expired on January 15, 1977, the 90-day period within which to decide the case should not be counted from such date but from the date the period of 45 days which he gave to his stenographer to complete her transcript of stenographic notes expires, namely, March 1, 1977. He thus concludes that when he rendered the decision on May 23, 1977, only 83 days have lapsed. Justifying his act of giving his stenographer a long period of 45 days within which to complete her transcript of stenographic notes, respondent Judge explains that said stenographer is the lone personnel of the court performing, aside from her regular duties as stenographer, the routinary work in the office. He ascribes the delay in the transcription of the stenographic notes, which was not even completed within the 45-day period, to the heavy load of cases consisting of 27 criminal cases newly filed and 33 cases pending. Respondent Judge furthermore states that he has been designated by the Executive Judge, Hon. Oscar M. Herrera, as Municipal Judge Designate of Placer, Surigao del Norte as of June, 1977. Finally, he explains that the reason why the decision was promulgated only on July 1, 1977 was because of the motion for postponement of promulgation filed by the complainant himself .

2)	
Failure to pay just debts — 
Respondent denies being indebted to Sergio Lawan, the brother of the complainant, and presents as Annex ""9"" of his comment a receipt dated September 17, 1976 whereby Fresnida Lawan, wife of Sergio Lawan, acknowledged having ""(r)eceived the amount of One Hundred and Thirty Pesos and Fifty Centavos (P130.50) from Antonio P. Moleta as payment for all his vales and accounts with (Lawan's) store and carinderia."" 
12
 


3)	
Habitual drunkenness — 
Respondent disputes the complainant's charge of habitual drunkenness with the certification issued by Dr. Rafael B. Eliot. Rural Health Physician of Bacuag, Surigao del Norte, to the effect that the former is under the latter's medical care since 1975, for Hypertension, Essential, with blood pressure reading ranging from 140180/20-110, and has been advised by him to refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages. Respondent contends that with such physical condition, a habitual drunkard cannot survive up to the present. Furthermore, he points out that if it were true, as complainant alleged, that there are ""witnesses to his drinking vice (who) are willing to come out in the open to testify"", why did complainant not submit even one affidavit just like he did in his second charge where he submitted an affidavit of his brother? 
13
 


4)	
Absenteeism and Tardiness — 
Respondent avers that he reports to office everyday, except in cases of emergency. He wonders how complainant - who is a teacher and who must perforce attend to his own classes every school day - can pretent to have a first hand information on his absence or tardiness, unless complainant has absented himself from his own duties merely to spy upon him. Again respondent asks why complainant failed to produce even a single affidavit of a resident in Bacuag to support his charge. 
14
 


After a careful consideration of the complaint and the comment, together with their respective annexes, we find that the facts of record sufficiently provide a basis for the determination of respondent's administrative liability, or lack of it, without the further need of referring the four charges levelled against him to the executive judge for investigation. 
15
 We shall, thus, dispose of this case at this stage of the proceeding, resolving the aforesaid charges in their order of significance. 


1)	
FAILURE TO PAY JUST DEBTS 


We find no merit in the complainant's charge that respondent fails and refuses to settle his account with the store of Sergio Lawan (complainant's brother) since 1972. The receipt issued by Fresnida Lawan (wife of Sergio Lawan) on September 17, 1976 acknowledging payment by respondent of all his vales and accounts with Lawans store and carinderia "" 
16
 
negates any claim of account incurred with said store prior to such date. 


2)	
HABITUAL DRUNKENNESS 


We deem respondent's explanation satisfactory. Because he is suffering from hypertension, as certified to by Dr. Rafael E. Eliot, 
17
 
he cannot imbibe liquor to the extent of being habitually drunk without endangering his health and life. 


3)	
ABSENTEEISM AND TARDINESS 


Complainant has not presented any proof to substantiate his charge of absenteeism and tardiness. Thus, the presumption of regular performance of official duties by the respondent Judge stands. 


4)	
DELAYED JUDGMENT 


Respondent admits that the period he gave to the parties in the criminal case within which to file their memoranda expired on January 15, 1977 and that he rendered the decision on May 23, 1977, or after a period of 128 days. He, however, insists that the 90-day period within which to decide the case should begin to run not from the expiry date of the period to file the memoranda but from March 1, 1977, the expiry date of the 45-day period he gave his stenographer to complete the transcript of stenographic notes. He thus contends that he decided the case well within the 90-day period since only 83 days have lapsed from March 1, 1977 to May 23, 1977. 


Such contention is untenable. It is clear from the provision of Art. X, Sec. 11 of the 1973 Constitution and of Sec. 5 of the Judiciary Act (R.A. No. 296) that the period within which a court should decide a case should be reckoned with from the date said case is submitted for derision. And a criminal case is considered submitted for decision upon termination of the trial and/or the expiration of the period to file memoranda. 


Respondent's claim that such reglementary period commences to run only upon the expiration of the period he gave his stenographer to complete her transcript of stenographic notes is clearly without merit. Precisely, judges are directed to take down notes of salient portions of the hearing and to proceed in the preparation of decisions without waiting for the transcript of stenographic notes. 
18
 Furthermore, we have already ruled that with or without the transcribed stenographic notes, the 90-day period for deciding cases should be adhered to. 
19
 


Consequently, We find respondent Judge guilty of delay in the rendition of judgment when he decided Criminal Case No. 869 on May 23, 1977, 128 days after the same was submitted for decision. 


WHEREFORE, the charges of failure to pay just debts, habitual drunkenness and absenteeism and tardiness are hereby DISMISSED, but respondent Judge, for having decided Criminal Case No. 869 beyond the 90-day period required by Sec. 11, Art. X of the Constitution and Sec. 5 of the Judiciary Act, is hereby REPRIMANDED and ADMONISHED that a repetition of the same offense will be dealt with dismissal from the service. 


Let this Resolution be noted in the personal record of respondent Judge in this Court. 


SO ORDERED. 


Barredo, (Acting Chairman), Antonio, Aquino and Abad Santos, JJ., concur. 


Concepcion Jr., J., is on leave.
