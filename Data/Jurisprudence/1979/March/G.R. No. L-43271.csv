The record shows that Felizardo Marasigan was in the employ of Blue Bar Coconut Philippines, Inc. as helper mechanic. While thus employed, the claimant suffered PTB which was either aggravated by or the result of the nature of his employment with the respondent. The claimant was referred to the Compensation Rating Medical Officer of the Workmen's Compensation Unit at Regional Office No. 5 for physical examination and evaluation of his disability. On October 21, 1974, Dr. Remedios B. Sanchez, Compensation Rating Medical Officer, submitted a report which stated that the claimant had suffered temporary total disability for labor from December 13, 1972 to June 13, 1973 or 183 days equivalent to 26 1/7 weeks; and that the claimant had also suffered permanent partial disability at 12% NSD. 


The Acting Chief of Unit, Regional Office No. 5, issued the award to Felizardo Marasigan on the following considerations: 




Under the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, the following benefits should be extended to the claimant: 


1.	Under Sec. 13 ... the Act, as amended, claimant is entitled to reimbursement of medical expenses incurred in the amount of ____ and to such services appliances and supplies as the nature of his/her disability and the process of his/her recovery may require. 


2.	Under Sec. 14 of the same Act, that she is entitled to 60% of his/her average weekly wage for the period he/she was incapacitated for labor from December 13, 1972 to June 13, 1973 or 183 days or 26 1/7 weeks. Sixty per centum of his/her average weekly wage which was P42.00 equals P25.20 and for 26 1/7 weeks, then she is entitled to (a total of P658.80 (weekly) compensation of ____ beginning ____ and weekly thereafter until his/her disability has ceased provided that the total amount of compensation shall not exceed P6,000.00, including the first lump will payment; 


3.	Under Sec. 17 of the same Act, he/she is entitled to compensation for permanent partial disability equivalent to 50% of his/her average weekly wage for the period of 24.96 weeks. Fifty per centum of his/her average weekly wage which was P42.00 equals P21.00 and for 24.96 weeks, then she is entitled to P524.16.

The Blue Bar Coconut Philippines, Inc. appealed to the Workmen's Compensation Commission and contended that: 




The claimant is not entitled to compensation benefit as he voluntarily stopped working upon attainment normal retirement age; and 


Assuming that he has a cause of action against the respondent, he miserably failed to prove the causal connection between his employment and his alleged illness. 
5
 




The Workmen's Compensation Commission found that on the day the claimant, petitioner herein, stopped working, he was not suffering from any disabling illness and that his employment was merely terminated because he was already sixty (60) years old and his separation from his work was in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. 
6
 


It is a fact, however, that the Compensation Rating Medical Officer of Regional Office No. 5 at San Pablo City found on October 21, 1974 that the claimant had suffered temporary total disability for labor for 183 days by reason of PTB minimal which supervened during the employment of the petitioner. There arises a presumption that the claim is compensable.

In 
Simon vs. Republic of the Philippines 
(Supreme Court) 
8
 this Court said: 




... In a very recent case penned by Mr. Justice Claudio Teehankee, this Court held: '... assuming the employee's illness may be ruled out as an occupational disease or That the causal between the nature of his employment and his ailment has been gently shown, nevertheless, it is to be presumed as mandated by Section 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, that the employee's illness which supervened during his employment either arose out of, or at least aggravated by said employment and with this presumption, the burden of proofs shifts to the employer and the employee is relieved of the burden to show causation. In the case before Us, the respondent has failed to discharge that burden. ... . 




Moreover, the respondent, Blue Bar Coconut Philippines, Inc., did not controvert the claim for compensation within the period provided by law. Hence, said respondent has lost its right to controvert the right to compensation of petitioner except on jurisdictional 


The petitioner, in addition to the compensation benefits granted him is entitled to reimbursement of medical expenses supported by proper receipts. 


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby set aside and the respondent, Blue Bar Coconut Philippines, Inc., is ordered: 


		1)	To pay the claimant the sum of Six Hundred Fifty-Eight pesos and Eighty-Centavos (P658.80) as compensation benefit; 


		2)	To pay the claimant the sum of Five Hundred Twenty-Four Pesos and Sixteen Centavos (P524.16) as compensation under Section 17 of the Workmen's Compensation Act; 


		3)	To pay the petitioner attorney's fees in the amount of One Hundred Twenty Pesos (P 120.00); 


		4)	To reimburse the petitioner medical expenses supported by proper receipts; and 


		5)	To pay the successor of the Workmen's Compensation Commission the amount of Fifty-One Pesos (P51.00) as administrative fees. 


SO ORDERED.
