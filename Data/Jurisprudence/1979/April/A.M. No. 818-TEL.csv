RE: REPORT ON THE SHORTAGE OF THE ACCOUNTABILITIES OF CLERK OF COURT CARLITO U. ALVIZO, 
respondent.




ANTONIO, 
J.:


On November 10, 1978, this Court received, thru the Chief Justice, a letter of Acting Chairman of the Commission on Audit dated October 18, 1978, informing Us that after an investigation of accounts of respondent Carlito U. Alvizo, Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance, Lianga, Surigao del Sur, the provincial Auditor, Mr. Miguel Piñalosa, found his accounts short of P31,612.50. Consequently, on November 14, 1978, the Chief Justice directed the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance at Lianga, Surigao del Sur, Hon. Otilio G. Abaya, to ""investigate and submit a report immediately"" on the matter, and if the relief of the Clerk of Court is warranted, to submit the name of one of his employees as temporary replacement.


In the meantime, this Court resolved: (1) to suspend Clerk of Court Alvizo from the discharged of his duties and functions as such, pending final disposition of the case (2) to require him to file his answer to the charge of shortage of accountabilities against him; (3) to direct, within ten (10) days from notice, Judge Abaya to continue the investigation of Clerk of Court Alvizo; and (4) to designate Atty. Domingo de Castro as Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Clerk of Court, Court of First Instance of Surigao del Sur at Lianga, in addition to his present duties, but without additional compensation.


On December 19, 1978, this Court received the complete records of investigation conducted by the Executive Judge of Lianga, Surigao del Sur, regarding the shortage of the accountable funds of Clerk of Court Carlito U. Alvizo, confirming the shortage, subsequently restitution of amount by respondent, and his recommendation on the matter. According to his report, the afore-mentioned administrative case was set for hearing, after due notice to respondent, on November 27, 1978 at which proceedings Mr. Miguel Piñalosa, Provincial Auditor of Surigao del Sur and Mr. Nerio Sales, Chief of Auditing Division of the same office, testified that on August 22, 1978, they examined and audited the cash and accounts of respondent Clerk of Court Carlito U. Alvizo and found him short of P31,612.50 (Exhibits ""A"", ""B"", ""B-1"", to ""B-3""), consisting of the following:






A. Collections:										 (1) As Clerk of Court.........................	P20,751.55.				 (2) Fiduciary fund............................... 	 5,440.00.				 (3) Legal Research fund..................... 	 1,059.55.				 (4) Provincial Sheriff's fund...............	 2,656.40.


B. Cash advance........................................................	 1,705.00.			 	Total (Exhibit ""F"")............................................... P31,612.50.






Demand was made of respondent to refund or restitute such shortage of P31,612.50 on August 23, 1978 and again on October 5, 1978 (Exhibit ""C""). The respondent sent a telegram to Nerio Sales on November 9, 1978, informing the latter that he would be remitting the amount corresponding to his shortage thru PNB, San Fransisco, Agusan del Sur (Exhibit ""D""). On November 16, 1978 and November 17, 1978 respondent deposited with the Philippine National Bank at San Fransisco, Agusan del Sur, the total amount of P31,612.50 (Exhibits ""W"", ""W-1""; ""X"", ""X-1""; ""Y"", ""Y-1""; ""Z"", ""Z-1""; ""AA"", ""AA-1"") in full payment of his shortage.


In the meantime, due to the failure of the respondent to refund or restitute his shortage within the time granted him by the Provincial Auditor's office (Exhibit ""C""), the Provincial Auditor sent a telegram on October 7, 1978 to the Regional Director, Commission on Audit, Region XI, Davao City, informing said official that upon examination of respondent's accounts he was found short P31,612.50 (Exhibit ""E""). On November 18, 1978, the Provincial Auditor submitted to the same Regional Director his findings and recommendations with respect to respondent's shortage of his cash and accounts (Exhibit ""F"").


On December 4, 1978, respondent submitted his manifestation, alleging the following:

MAKASIAR,

concurring: 


The act committed by respondent constitutes malversation of public funds penalized by Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code and he should accordingly be prosecuted, aside from being banned from reinstatement or re- employment in the government, its local political subdivisions, and other agencies, including government-owned or controlled corporations. Mere dismissal would be too lenient for such a serious crime and would place a premium on the commission of graft by public officers. 


Hence, the dispositive portion should include ""with prejudice to his reinstatement or re-employment in the government or any of its local political subdivisions or agencies, including government-owned or controlled corporations; but without prejudice to his criminal prosecution. 


""Let certified copies of this decision and the pertinent records of this case, be referred to the Provincial Fiscal of Surigao del Sur for appropriate action. ""
