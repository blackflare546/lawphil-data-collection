DOMINADOR CARLOS,

vs.


BENIGNO PALAGANAS,
 respondent.


R E S O L U T I O N


DIZON, 
J.:


Respondent Benigno Palaganas having filed a verified answer to the complaint filed against him by complainant Dominador Carlos, alleging therein facts which, if true, would constitute a valid defense, the Court resolves to refer this case to Ricardo Paras, Jr. for investigation. 


The answer filed by respondent also makes the following allegations: .




2. Respondent also accuses said Dominador Carlos with the crime of contempt committed against the Honorable Tribunal for making public the proceedings of the said Tribunal by furnishing the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, the Organization where respondent works with a photostat copy of an Order issued by the Honorable Supreme Court dated February 20, 1962, ""requesting him to submit documented evidence"", thereby making public the proceedings in this case before it has been finally decided, with no apparent motive but to make the respondent out of the good graces of his employer, which act is contrary to and is disregard of Section 10 of Rule 128 of the Rules of Court. All of the foregoing acts of said complainant amount to insults against decency and all that are noble and dignified in this of in this way of life, and reveals nothing more but his ignoble tendencies for criminality which is a direct attack against the very heart of society. 




In view of the charge thus made against complainant, the latter is hereby required to answer the same, within five days from notice hereof, to explain why proceedings for contempt should not be had against him. 


Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L. and Paredes, JJ., concur.
