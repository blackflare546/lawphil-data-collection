R E S O L U T I O N

J.:


It appears that the charges filed in this case by complaint against respondent are directly involved in two cases now pending in the Court of First Instance of Agusan, namely, Civil Case No. 117, entitled Tranquilino O. Calo, Jr. vs. Villamor Dizon, at al., and Criminal Case No. 2347, entitled People vs. Tranquilino O. Calo, Jr.


In view of the above, upon motion of respondent, it is resolved that the investigation of the present Administrative case be held in abeyance until such time as this Court receives notice of the final determination of the two cases mentioned above.


Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Regala and Makalintal, JJ., concur.
