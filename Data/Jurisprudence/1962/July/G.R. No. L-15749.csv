REGALA, 
J.:


This is an appeal from orders of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court denying the herein appellant's motion for modification of its judgment dated August 31, 1956 in Civil Case No. 28836.


The issue raised herein is whether or not the appellant should be given 
until 1961
 within which to deliver 5,000 shares of stock to the appellees and to discharge the mortgage on said shares.


Considering that the period asked for has already expired, the Court finds that the question has become moot and academic, and that an opinion thereon would have no practical effect.


WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby dismiss No costs.


Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon and Makalintal, JJ., concur.

Reyes, J.B.L., J., took no part.
