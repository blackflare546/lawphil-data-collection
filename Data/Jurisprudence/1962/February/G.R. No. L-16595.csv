The case is now before Us on automatic review in view of the penalty imposed upon Primitivo Pinca alias Tiboy and Pascualito Adora alias Litoy. The other accused did not appeal. 


The circumstances upon which the two appellants base their claim for mitigating circumstances, may be summarized as follows: .


Appellant Primitivo Pinca alias Tiboy, declared that between 5:00 and 6:00 o'clock in the morning of October 18, 1958, he and his co-accused, one of whom was his brother Venerando Pinca, started for a journey from barrio Calomotan to Mapanas, Gamay, Samar, taking with them some clothing and a circular saw for sale and one carbine. Upon reaching Mapanas, Pascualito Adora, alias Litoy, mentioned to him the house of the deceased Ambrosio Montallana, who had plenty of cash, which place he knew, having once worked in the coconut plantation of said Montallana; that between him and Adora, but without the knowledge of the other accused, they planned to rob the place; that their group arrived in the vicinity at about 5: 00 o'clock in the afternoon, but they bided their time under the coconut trees in the plantation. When it was quite dark, Adora left alone to ascertain whether the occupants were already asleep; upon Adora's return, the group proceeded to the house, but they found the household still awake. While waiting for the inmates to retire, several policemen arrived at the house of Montallana, who left at about 10:00 o'clock at night. When silence prevailed in the house, Pinca and Adora passing thru a hole in the kitchen, used for urinating, entered the house. The two proceeded towards the living room, in the process of which Adora stepped on something which produced noise and awakened Ambrosio Montallana, who started to get up. This was seen by Pinca, because of the light coming from a kerosene lamp on the table. Pinca fired four successive shots at Montallana with the carbine (Exhibit 5), felling him; that after firing the shots, Pinca also saw two men (Donato Arceno and Gregorio Ortiz) trying to get a bayonet from one of the posts of the house, causing him to fire at them, a shot each. Adora thereafter hacked them with a bolo. Pinca asserted that when he fired his carbine, the victims were not asleep; Mrs. Montallana was curled up and covered with a blanket, and when the accused uncovered her and made her to stand, she voluntarily handed a bundle, saying: ""Do not kill me, here is the money""; and that Mrs. Montallana was tied by them to a post and gagged in order to prevent her from screaming. This appellant also told the trial court that it was not his intention to kill the victims; that two (2) carbines, two (2) Japanese rifles, a .45 caliber pistol, a bayonet and 200 rounds of ammunition were found inside the house of the Montallanas and seized by them. After committing the above acts, they left for their home barrio, and there Pascualito Adora distributed the money in the bag among themselves. They also agreed to contribute P5.00 each to be spent for a requiem mass for the victims; that he repented for his sins and while in jail, he received Holy Communion. He further informed the Court that he squandered his share in the loot, before his arrest; that while he thought of surrendering, he waited until he was arrested; that he voluntarily confessed and admitted the crime to the arresting officers and even reenacted the same; and that he pointed to the PC soldiers the place where the firearms and ammunitions were hidden. 


Appellant Pascualito Adora alias Litoy, confirmed the testimony of appellant Pinca as to what had taken place moment they entered the house of the Montallanas; that it was Pinca who fired at Montallana and the two other deceased and he (Adora) hacked the other two, after Pinca had shot them, because they were shouting for help and were armed with bayonets; that it was Pinca who tied Mrs. Montallana; that they found firearms and ammunitions in the house of the victim; that they divided the loot and contributed P5.00 each for a requiem mass; that he was arrested in Manila by the PC that he became familiar with the layout of the place where the crime was committed, thru his cousin Arturo de la Cruz, whose father was a tenant of the deceased Montallana; that he (Adora) told Pinca of Montallana's wealth; and that the three (3) other accused remained outside the house. 


In view of said testimonies, the trial court made the following observations: —




The mitigating circumstances invoked by the defendants namely (1) lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed can not be taken into consideration in the present case because any one firing several shots to somebody and striking several blows with a bolo at a person, can not claim that his intention was not to commit so grave a wrong as that committed; neither the defense of incomplete self-defense can be taken into consideration because as the prosecution aptly alleges that our Supreme Court in the case of People v. Buenafe, 34 O.G. page 2504, said: 'There must be an unlawful aggression otherwise this defense cannot be invoked.' Even admitting that Ambrosio Montallana and his two tenants, Donato Arceno and Gregorio Ortiz, tried to defend themselves against the herein defendants, said acts can not be construed as an unlawful aggression. .... 




The above findings and conclusion are borne out by the evidence produced by the appellants themselves, bringing to the fore, the fact that the only mitigating circumstance which would favor the appellants is the plea of guilty. 


Counsel alleges that the trial court erred (1) in considering the aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place, as a separate and distinct aggravating circumstance from nocturnity; (2) in not considering that treachery absorbed the circumstance of nocturnity, and (3) in imposing the death penalty upon the appellants. In other words, it is maintained that the three aggravating circumstances should have been taken only as one, because they absorb each other, and there being a plea of guilty, the proper penalty should be life imprisonment. 


The aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place (despoblado) does not exist; the aggravating circumstance of dwelling, however, is present. It is held that the aggravating circumstances of dwelling and scaling were present in the commission of the crime of robbery with homicide, ""... because the store where it was committed is a dwelling, the deceased Cua Loc having lived therein, and because there is scaling when entrance is effected through an opening not intended for said purpose. ... The foregoing circumstances were certainly not inherent in the crime committed, because, the crime being robbery with violence or intimidation against persons, the authors thereof could have committed it without the necessity of violating or scaling the domicile of their victim"" (People vs. Valdez, 64 Phil. 860). In the case at bar, Montallana and the other victims were killed by the appellants with firearm and bolo, inside the house of the former, after having gained entrance therein, thru an opening not intended for entrance or egress. 


Except in special cases, nighttime and treachery always go together and are absorbed in the same offense (People v. Magsinling, 82 Phil. 271; People v. Young, 83 Phil. 702). Nighttime cannot be considered as an aggravating circumstance and independent of that of treachery and abuse of superior strength (People v. Balagtas, 68 Phil. 675). Abuse of superior strength is not treachery, although it might be absorbed by the latter (U.S. v. Estopia, 28 Phil. 97). Superiority of strength may be derived from the number of assailants and the simultaneousness of the attack (U.S. v. Lozada, 21 Phil. 287). If treachery is present, it may absorb superior strength (Peo. v. Mobe, 81 Phil. 58). In the present case, the element of treachery cannot always be successfully disputed. The position of the wounds clearly reveals that the victims were shot in their sleep.While the appellants deny that they were asleep, the bullet holes on the floor of the house, however, are mute but eloquent proofs that the said victims were at least lying down and not standing, when shot. In a case, treachery had been taken as an aggravating circumstance when the accused took advantage of the position of the victims who were lying down on the sacks of the mail, unable to offer any resistance or escape (People v. Galang, 73 Phil. 184). Of course, the appellants claim that the victims were prepared for the occasion, stating that firearms were seized by the accused from the Montallana house. There could be no truth in this allegation, for if the Montallanas were really prepared or were anticipating the robbery, they could have guarded against the possible infiltration of the appellants. Moreover, the widow of Montallana denied this claim. 


The crime was committed with the aid of armed men (par. 8, Art. 14, Rev. Penal Code; Peo. v. Villapa, et al., G.R. No. L-4252, Apr. 30, 1952). At least, two of the accused, the appellants herein, were armed with carbine and bolo, when the five accussed perpetrated the crime. From which We may deduce that as far as the evidence in the case at bar is concerned, there exists three aggravating circumstances, to wit: dwelling, treachery and the crime was committed with the aid of armed men. 


In results, therefore, that the three aggravating circumstances is offset by one mitigating circumstance, thereby justifying the painful imposition of the capital punishment upon the appellants. It should be stated in this connection that the whole record shows a criminal perversity, which entitles the State to demand the forfeiture of the appellants' right to live, in the name of peace, order and retributory justice. 


WHEREFORE, the sentence imposed in the decision, subject-matter of this automatic review, is affirmed, with costs against appellants.
