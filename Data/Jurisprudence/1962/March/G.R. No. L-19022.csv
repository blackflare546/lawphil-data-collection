DIZON, 
J.:


Before us is a verified petition filed by Benjamin P. Palomique, with supporting documents, some of them consisting of sworn statements, to declare Woodworks, Inc., its officers, agents and contractors in contempt of court for having committed gross violations of the writ of preliminary injunction issued against them by this Court on November 18, 1961. The parties charged with contempt have filed a verified answer to said petition, similarly supported by several sworn statements, in which they deny the acts imputed to them and alleged to be in violation of the aforesaid writ.


The questions of fact arising from the petition and the answer above mentioned, and the documents submitted in support thereof, being of importance, we deem it necessary to have the parties present evidence on their conflicting contentions. For this purpose, the matter and the pertinent papers are hereby ordered forwarded to the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur for the reception of such evidence and the filing and submission to this Court of the corresponding report containing its findings and recommendation.
