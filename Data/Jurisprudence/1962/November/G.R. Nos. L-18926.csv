DIZON, 
J.:


In the general elections held on November 10, 1959, respondent Flores M. Alunan and petitioner Anastacio Pangontao were among the candidates for mayor of municipality of Talakag, province of Bukidnon. On November 12 of the same year, the Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Pangontao as mayor elect with plurality of 37 votes over Alunan. Not satisfied wit the result, the latter filed the corresponding election protest within the legal period in the Court of First Instance of said province. After due hearing, said court reaffirmed the election of Pangontao but with a plurality of 16 votes only, which, upon motion for reconsideration, was further reduced to 4 votes.


Petitioner Alunan appealed to the Court of Appeals assailing the rulings of the trial court on a good number of ballots admitted as valid votes for Pangontao. After hearing the case, the Court of Appeals rendered the appealed decision declaring Alunan as mayor elect of Talakag by a plurality of 1 vote and awarding him the costs of suit. The pertinent portions of said decision read as follows:




As elsewhere noted, the protestant and the protestee received 789 votes and 560 votes, respectively, in the 10 precincts of Talakag not involved in the protest; while after the lower court deducted 7 votes from the protestant and 35 votes from protestee, the contested precincts gave protestant 312 votes and protestee 545 votes or a grand total of 1,101 and 1,105, respectively, with 4 votes plurality for protestee.


In this appeal, protestant-appellant assails 50 votes adjudicated in favor of protestee, of which 5 votes were voided (Exhibits B-22, B-23, B-24, B-25 and E-11), deductible from protestee's votes; whereas none was annulled of the 25 votes challenged by protestee-appellee. The result is shown in the following tabulation:
