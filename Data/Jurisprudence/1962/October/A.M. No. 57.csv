HON. EUSEBIO F. RAMOS, Judge of the Court of First Instance Occidental Mindoro,
 respondent.


R E S O L U T I O N


REGALA, 
J.:


This administrative case was filed by one Hermenegildo Absalud in November, 1958, against Hon. Eusebio F. Ramos, the then Judge of the Eighth Judicial District. The charges preferred are for malversation thru falsification of public document, serious misconduct and inefficiency in office.


The case has been referred to Associate Justice Eugenio Angeles of the Court of Appeals, who, after investigation thereon, has submitted a report recommending that the respondent be exonerated of all the charges, for the reason that as far as the first charge is concerned, he has well explained his side on the malversation charge; and that there is no substantial evidence to support the other charges for serious misconduct and inefficiency.


After going over the record, we agree with the said Justice Angeles that the complainant has not made out a good case against the respondent.


It appearing, however, that the respondent Judge Eusebio Ramos is already retired, we find it unnecessary to make an extensive discussion on the matter.


WHEREFORE, Administrative Case No. 57 is hereby dismissed. Without pronouncement as to costs.


Bengzon, C.J., Padilla,, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon and Makalintal, JJ.,
 concur.
