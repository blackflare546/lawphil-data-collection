""CONSULTA"" No. 1013 OF THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF TAYABAS. GOTAUCO & CO.,
 applicant-appellant,

vs.


THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF TAYABAS,
 oppositor-appellee.


Godofredo Reyes for appellant.

Office of the Solicitor-General Hilado for appellee.


BUTTE, 
J.:


This is an appeal from a judgment of the Fourth Branch of the Court of First Instance of Manila in a 
consulta
 submitted by the register of deeds of Tayabas.


Our decision upon this appeal has been facilitated because both the appellant and the appellee, the latter being represented by the Solicitor-General, agreed that the judgment should be reversed.


On August 12, 1932, when Exhibits A and B were presented to the register, by which a levy of execution against the judgment debtor, 
Rafael
 Vilar was made on fifteen contracts of land described in Exhibit B and registered in the name of 
Florentino
 Vilar, the register properly denied the inscription of said levy of execution because the title to the lands was in the name of Florentino Vilar and no evidence was submitted that Rafael Vilar had any present or possible future interest in the land. On September 17, 1932, there was presented to him a copy of a petition filed in the Court of First Instance of the province, entitled, ""Intestado del Finado Florentino Vilar"", from which he could properly infer that Florentino Vilar was dead and that the judgment debtor Rafael Vilar is one of the heirs of the deceased Florentino Vilar. Although the value of the participation of Rafael Vilar in the estate of Florentino Vilar was indeterminable before the final liquidation of the estate, nevertheless, the right of participation in the estate and the lands thereof may be attached and sold. The real test was laid down by this court in the case of 
Reyes vs. Grey 
(21 Phil., 73, 76), namely: Does the judgment debtor hold such a beneficial interest in the property that he can sell or otherwise dispose of it for value? Nothing appears in this record to indicate that Rafael Vilar being 
sui juris 
could not dispose of his interest or share as heir in the estate of Florentina Vilar. Having this right, he could by a conveyance defeat
 pro tanto 
the provisions of section 450 of the Code of Civil Procedure and thus deprive the judgment creditor of the benefit of a lawful execution. (

On October 12, 1932, with the knowledge which he them had, the register should have accepted and inscribed Exhibit A, B and D.


The judgment in this 
consulta
 is reversed without special pronouncement as to costs.
