MALCOLM, 
J.:


Juan C. Isada, a member of the Philippine bar, was convicted of the crime of concubinage and is now serving his sentence in Bilibid Prison. The Code of Civil Procedure, in its section 21, provides that a member of the bar may be removed or suspended from his office of lawyer by the Supreme Court by reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude. It is held that the crime of concubinage involves moral turpitude. (
In re 
Basa [1920], 41 Phil., 275.)


It is the order of the court that beginning with the day when Juan C. Isada shall be discharged from prison, he be suspended from his office of lawyer for one year.
