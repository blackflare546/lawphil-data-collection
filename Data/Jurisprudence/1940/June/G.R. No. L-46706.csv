In the municipality of San Esteban of the above-mentioned province this April 11, 1921, A. D., personally appeared Petrona J. Gray Abaya and Dorotea Gray Abaya known to me be same persons who executed the foregoing document and who acknowledge to have executed the same freely and voluntarily. 


The interested parties did not exhibit their cedula tax by reason of their sex.

S. 1921




Petrona Gray and Dorotea Gray both died intestate and without either ascendants or descendants, the first on January 28, 1926, and the second on July 9, 1927. Miguel Cariño, designated in the above-quoted document as the one administer or deliver the properties therein referred to, predeceased Dorotea Gray as he died on February 12, 1927. After the lapse of about seven years from the death of Dorotea Gray, or on February 16, 1935, Jose Cariño, son of Miguel Cariño and petitioner herein, commenced intestate proceedings in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur in which he prayed that he be appointed administrator of the estate left by the Gray sisters. Subsequently, on June 5, 1935, the said Jose Cariño filed an amended petition praying that the properties described in paragraph III thereof be declared trust properties and that he be appointed trustee of the same. On July 12, 1935, Father Fernando Ma. Abaya, respondent herein and first cousin of Petrona and Dorotea Gray, interposed an opposition to the amended petition alleging that the document executed on April 11, 1921, by the Gray sisters (Exhibit C-1) is null and void and praying that the court make an adjudication to that effect. While on the one hand, Jose Cariño contended that Exhibit C-1 is a donation 
inter vivos 
creating at the time a trust, Father Fernando Abaya, on the other, alleged that said document is a will. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur rendered judgment, the dispositive part of which is as follows:




In view of the foregoing reasons, the court is of the opinion and so that the properties described in paragraph 2, 3 and 4 of Exhibit C-1 are trust properties destined by the said trustors for religious and pious purposes; and that the properties enumerated in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the said Exhibit C-1 are invalid trust for the reason that the properties described in paragraph 5 did not belong to the said trustors, and, that the properties described in paragraph 6 thereof were destined for a trust, the purpose of which is uncertain; and that while the designation of said Jose Carino is invalid, still the court may appoint one to act as such (R. C. L., p. 1274). 


In view thereof, the court declares the properties described in paragraph 2, 3 and 4 of Exhibit C-1 trust properties, and, for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions contained in said trust, application for the appointment of a competent trustee may be made by the interested parties and after due haring, the court will appoint trustee or trustees, according as the situation may demand.




 From this judgment, appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals which held that Exhibit C-1 was neither a donation 
inter vivos
 as contended by the petitioner herein nor a will as alleged by the respondent, but a void donation 
mortis causa
, void because it was not executed with the formalities of a will. The dispositive part of the decision of the Court of Appeals is of the following tenor:




Wherefore, the appealed judgment is hereby reversed without pronouncement as to costs. Let the record of this case be remanded to the court of origin with instruction to proceed with the appointment of an administrator of the properties belonging to the estate of the deceased, Petrona and Dorotea Gray, involved in this appeal, said administrator to be proposed by the appellant, Fernando Abaya, and for such other appropriate proceedings as the law requires.




We are now urged to hold by counsel for the petitioner that the Court of Appeals erred:.




I. In passing upon the validity of the deed of donation, Exhibit C-1 in the absence of any appeal on this point in violation of established rules of pleading and practice. 


II. In holding that the deed of donation, Exhibit C-1, is a void donation 
MORTIS CAUSA
 wanting in the formalities of a will, and not a consummated donation IN PRAESENTI (
inter vivos
). 


III. In holding that Miguel Cariño was not authorized by the donees to accept the donation in Exhibit C-1 in their behalf, when the question of authority is not in issue, thereby committing an act of supererogation in violation of code practice. 


IV. In not holding that the respondent Fernando Abaya (oppositor below) is without legal personality and interest in the suit, and cannot therefore attack the validity of Exhibit C-1 collaterally. 


V. In not holding that whatever right or action the respondent Fernando Abaya(oppositor below) has, by his laches and voluntary waiver and failure to appeal from so much of the judgment of the trial court, has already prescribed. 


VI. In not applying the doctrine of estoppel to the facts of the case in violation of established rules and jurisprudence applicable thereto. 


VII. In not holding that the properties described in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of Exhibit C-1 are absolute gifts to Miguel Cariño, predecessor in interest of petitioner Jose M. Cariño, subject only to a charge.


VIII. In not submitting the decision appealed from to the Court in BANC in view of the considerable value of the state, the weighty questions of law and special circumstances of the case. 


IX. In not granting the relief prayed for the petitioner Jose M. Cariño (applicant below), and in rendering the judgment object of this review. 


X. The Honorable Court of Appeals has departed from the accepted usual course of judicial proceedings in rendering the decision object of this review. 




Under the first assignment of error, the petitioner raises the point that the nature or validity of Exhibit C-1, not being a subject of appeal, could not be passed upon by the Court of Appeals. We dismiss this point for lack of basis. In the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, the question of validity was directly controverted when, in his opposition, the respondent alleged that ""el documento de supuesto donacion a que la solicitud enmendada es nulo y carece de eficacia legal."" In the Court of Appeals the same issue was put in litigation as a result of the exception taken by the respondent to the judgment of the trial court, and, particularly, to the conclusion of said that the properties described n paragraphs 2, 3, and 5 of Exhibit C-1 are trust properties, an exception which, if considered in relation to the respondent's ground of opposition, necessarily involved the proposition that said properties could not be trust properties because the document creating the alleged trust is null and void. Counsel for the petitioner also argues that the trial court could not pass upon the validity of the document in question for the reason that, relying on the case of 
Lopez vs. Olbes
 (15 Phil., 540), the instant case is a special proceeding. We cannot concede controlling force to the decision cited, because it merely held that objections ""founded on some defect or vice, which affect the essential nature and formalities of the act of consideration of the action relative thereto, must be heard and argued in an ordinary action, and must be decided in accordance with law by a final judgment, and not by a ruling on a demurrer which ordinarily occurs in connection with an incidental motion concerning mere formalities of procedure and not in a full trial or due process of law wherein the rights of the contestants have been examined, argued, and proved."" In the present case the question regarding the validity of Exhibit C-1 was not determined in a ruling upon a demurrer. Furthermore, the record indicates that this is the first time the petitioner has taken the trouble on interposing the technical objection suggested in his first assignment of error, and we have already expressed our disapproval of such practice. (Tan Machan 
vs.
 De la Trinidad et al., 3 Phil., 684; Alafriz 
vs.
 Mina, 28 Phil., 137; Vergara 
vs.

vs.

vs.
 National Loan & Investment Board, G. R. N. 46571, promulgated October 31, 1939.) It may be added that the line of argument of the petitioner, of adopted, would be conducive to multiplicity of suits.


The second, third and seventh errors assigned by counsel for the petitioner submit the major question whether Exhibit C-1 is a donation 
inter vivos
 as claimed by the petitioner, or a will as insisted by the respondent. We concur in the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the document in dispute is a donation 
mortis causa
. The seventh clause of the document reciting that ""we the sisters do hereby order that all these properties shall be given to those to whom they have been assigned by virtue of this instrument at the expiration of thirty days after the death of the last one to die between us,"" considered in conjunction with the fact that the grantors employed the terms ""there shall given to,"" ""shall administer,"" and ""shall be administered,"" which have reference to the future, clearly brings forth the intention on the part of the Gray sisters to make the distribution of their estate, as mapped out in Exhibit C-1, effective after their death. The above-quoted seventh clause, being without limitation, applies as well to the properties intended to be distributed as to the properties merely to be administered by Miguel Cariño. It is worthy of observation, also, that in the ninth clause of Exhibit C-1 the phrase ""together with those who had been mentioned to inherit from us"" supplies a cogent reason for concluding that the grant therein made was meant to take effect the death of the grantors for the word ""inherit,"" as used here, implies the acquisition of property by the heirs after the death of the Gray sisters. In support of the contention that the document in controversy is a donation 
inter vivos
, the petitioner alleges that Miguel Cariño administered the properties described in the second, third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of Exhibit C-1, thereby insinuating that the donation took effect even before the death of the grantors. Upon this question we can make no choice as it is not within our province to review, much less alter, the finding of the Court of Appeals that the petitioner's contention ""is supported by the facts."" (Hodges 
vs.
 People, G. R. No. 45446, promulgated May 25, 1939; Mora Electric Co., Inc. 
vs.
 Matic et al., G. R. No. 45441, promulgated June 26, 1939; Bundoc 
vs.
 Hilario et al., G. R. No. 46852, promulgated February 27, 1940.).


Donations which are to become effective upon the death of the donor partake of the nature of disposals of property by will shall be governed by the rules established for testamentary successions. (Art, Civil Code.) Accordingly, said donations can only be made with the formalities of a will. (Tuason and Tuason C-1 was not 54 Phil. 289.) As the document Exhibit C-1 was not executed in conformity with the provisions of section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, conspicuously for lack of attestation clause and marginal signatures, we are constrained to hold the same cannot be accorded any force and effect. It may be stated in passing that the case at bar cannot be controlled by the decisions in 
Laureta vs. Mata and Magno
 (44 Phil., 668); 
Zapanta vs. Posadas
 (52 Phil., 557); and 
Balaqui vs. Dongso
 (53 Phil., 673), cited by the petitioner, in view of difference in factual basis. 


The Court of Appeals found that the respondent is the nearest relative of Petrona and Dorotea Gray, a finding of fact which we cannot revise. It results that, as such the respondent has an interest in any property of his deceased cousins, in that, in default of testamentary heirs, he would be entitled to inherit from them to the exclusion of more remote relatives. (Art. 913, 921, Civil Code.) The respondent declaration in the present action that the document which would otherwise have impaired such right to inherit, is void. Hence, the petitioner's contention, under the fourth assignment of error, that the respondent is without legal personality and interest in this suit, is without merit. Moreover, the appellate court should not incline to hear this criticism for the reason that, as the Court of Appeals found, it was not raised in the trial court. (Tan Machan 
vs.
 De la Trinidad,

; Alafriz 
vs.

vs.
 Laciapag,

vs.
 Ossorio,

vs.
 Grano,

; Meneses 
vs.
 National Loan & Investment Board, 
supra
.).


Under the fifth and sixth assignments of error, it is maintained by counsel for the petitioner that the opposition of the respondent being in the nature of an action to annul, the right of action of the latter has prescribed as the said opposition was filed on July 12, 1935, or about fourteen years after the date of the execution of Exhibit C-1. To dispose of this argument it is only necessary to state that this defense of prescription on the part of the petitioner was neither pleaded nor raised in the trial court, and the same was raised for the first time in the motion filed by the petitioner for the reconsideration of the decision of the Court of Appeals. And the argument of the petitioner that the respondent has waived his rights over the properties in question is refuted by the finding of the Court of Appeals that ""as a matter of fact the appellant, Abaya, is in actual possession of those properties, and was, at least at the time the original petition of Jose Cariño was filed, the latter having alleged it is said petition."".


Much less did the Court of Appeals err in not submitting the appealed decision to the court in banc, since there is no law or rule making the submission to the court 
in banc
 of such a case is now before us, mandatory. 


In view of what has been said, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be, as the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs against the petitioner. So ordered.
