The defendant, with reiterated all that was contained in the confession which he had previously made before the city police. he also testified that he was a minor below 18 years of age, producing his landing certificate of residence, and which claim was not contested by the prosecution.

 prision mayor 
in its maximum period, to 
reclusion temporal 
in its medium period. Considering the mitigating circumstances of plea of guilty, which is not offset by any aggravating circumstance, the penalty should be imposed in its minimum period or from ten years and one day to twelve years of
 prison mayor
. In the present case, paragraph 2 of article 68 of the Revised Penal Code should be applied and in accordance with the Indeterminate Sentence Law, which, which the trial court failed to apply, the appellant should be, and is hereby, sentence to an indeterminate penalty of from five years of
 prison correctional 
to ten years and one day of
