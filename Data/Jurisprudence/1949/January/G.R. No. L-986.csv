She was tied by a Japanese and Maximo Bate, and it was the latter who hanged her. (15).

Felix Alcover, 21, married, the accused, testified that he was member of the Philippine Constabulary but not a Japanese spy. At the outbreak of the war he was working on the steamship Legaspi. On December 8, 1941,  he volunteered for enlistment in the army. He was inducted as a soldier and stationed in Mandaue. (67). His commander was Lieutenant Cadileña. When the Japanese landed in Cebu, they retreated to the mountains. On June 28m 1942m he came down to look for his parents, whom he met in Pacola. On June 5 or 6, the witness was arrested by the Japanese. He was brought to the Snead Dormitory where he was investigated whether he was a member of the USAFFE and where his arms were. (68) He was tied and out inside a cell. where a companion Margarito Campos untied him. Fifteen das later they were taken by Major Cruz. The witness was brought to the P.C. headquarters. Given the choice of enlisting in the P.C. or being arrested and killed by the Japanese the witness offered to be enlisted and stayed in Major Crux' office where he worked until October, when he escaped and went to the mountains and reported to the command post of lieutenant Abella. (69). The station was in Bocawis in the mountains of Carcar. In September, the witness was sent to San Fernando where Captain Navarro made him a member of the headquarters a mopping-up operation and upon, orders to disband the witness went to Clarin, Bohol, where he remained until June, 1943. (70) Then he returned to Cebu to report to Lieutenant Abella with whom he remain until he was arrested for the second time by Marcha and Watanabe at Captain Navarro and Lieutenant Basillote. The witness answered that he did not know because he was in Bohol. After the investigation, Watanabe issued a pass for him and told him to enlist in the Philippine Constabulary so that he would not bee taken to the M.P. The witness then escaped and went to the M.P. The witness then escaped and went to the P.C. (command post) of Lieutenant Abella (71) Abella investigated him why he was arrested. While in Cabacolan, Lieutenant Abella ordered him to put some dynamite in a 
buri
 bag and  proceeded to the city. Upon reaching the residence of Major Laput, he found it was surrounded by soldiers and P. C's. Because he could not place the dynamite he went to Calamba and then returned to Cotabato to report to Lieutenant Abella who said ""maybe you are a spy. Why did you not put the dynamite in the residence of Mayor Laput,"" and told him that if he could not put the dynamite he would better not come back to the P.C. (72). The witness returned to the city but did not bring with him the dynamite. He proceeded to Padilla Street and looked for his friends. He saw Anita Bacani, who was his friend then employed as a telephone operator by the Japanese, and told her to be careful because the majority of employees under the Japanese were being arrested by the guerrillas. While living in Calamba, the witness was apprehended by some Filipinos. Dictong and others worked under the M. P. He was brought to the Normal School building at nighttime and put in prison where he saw his friends in the mountains such as Johnny Laurel and Pedro Lara. They were prisoners. (73). In December, the witness, not being released, was simply turned over by the Japanese to the command of Major Laput, who investigated him about his escape to the mountains. The witness answered that he went to the mountains because his parents were there. Major Laput told him to stay in the headquarters because he was still weak. The witness was put in the dell as a prisoner and was asked whether he preferred to enlist in the P.C. or go back to the Normal School building. (74). He said that he would enlist in the P. C. His first assignment was to clean Major Laput's table. When he got well, he was assigned to be a guard at the headquarters and sometimes as traffic officer. About the month of October, 1944. he met Rosario Bacani on the street and asked her, ""who is your husband now?"" She answered, ""A Japanese."" ""Oh, a Japanese,"" the accused said. ""Well you r sister Anita is wanted by the guerrillas because your husband is a Japanese."" (75). In December, 1944, the witness was fired at in the intersection of Sanciangko and Leon Kilat Streets. He was wounded. He did not know who fired at him. He was then under the command of Lieutenant Flor of the Philippine Constabulary. He was brought to the Japanese hospital. (76) There he stayed about three months, First he was treated by a Filipino, then by Japanese doctors, It is not true that on January 13, 1945, he went to the house of Anita and Rosario Bacani to arrest them, or that he went to Labangon accompanied by Japanese to arrest Francing Bacalla. Francing Bacalla was apprehended by Vicente Cobarrubias and Manrique. (77) The witness came to know Rosario Bacani because she was his classmate before the war. He came to know Anita when he was under the command of Lieutenant Abella. He did know whether he was under the Japanese or under a puppet movement. He knew that his high command were Filipinos. (78) When they were classmates, the witness was in good terms with Rosario Bacani. He did not have any trouble with her. (80-81). 


After a careful analysis of the evidence on record we have come to the conclusion that no overt act of treason was committed by appellant under the two-witness rule except his active participation in the arrest on January 13, 1945, of the two sisters Anita and Rosario Bacani, intelligence operatives of the guerrillas, who were maltreated and then confined for some time. According to Rosario Bacani, the accused was carrying a revolver. After her maltreatment, her hands were tied and it was the accused who dragged her by the rope to be taken to the truck that brought them to Cebu city. According to Anita Bacani, the accused took part in her arrest on January 13, 1945. He was carrying a revolver, and even told her to tell the truth so that she would not be killed, and that at the time that she was being maltreated, the accused was guarding her father , mother and sister. 


There is no doubt that appellant, to give aid and comfort to the Japanese, took part in the arrest of the Bacani sisters, for their guerrilla activities, but we do not believe that he deserves the penalty imposed upon him by the trial court. There is reason to believe, upon the testimony of the accused, that he must have acted under compulsion by the Japanese but not so irresistible to exempt him from all responsibility, but enough to mitigate it under paragraph 5 of article 12 and paragraph 1 of article 13 of the Revised Penal Code. The guilt of the accused is not so grave that when this Court voted for the first time whether to convict him or not, we were deadlocked in a tie vote, that we had to order a rehearing as provided by the rules. 


We believe that, for the purposes of justice, it wound be enough to impose upon the accused 12 years and I day of
 reclusion temporal
 and to order him to pay a fine of P2,000 with costs. 


Thus modified, the appealed decision is affirmed.

Separate Opinions


PABLO, 
M., 
concurrente:


Las pruebas obrantes en autos demuestran claramente que el acusado habia tomado parte en el arresto de las hermanas Rosario y Anita Bacani porque prestaban servicio a las guerrilas; tomo parte no solamente en su arresto sino tambien en su maltrato. Rosario Bacani habia sido colgada por mas de 30 minutos como si fuese una criminal. Cuando ella fue descolgada, el acusado fue el que, con el cordel en mano, la condujo a un truck para ser transportada a la Ciudad de Cebu. Anita Bacani, con las manos atadas en la espalda, habia sido tambien colgada por el acusado y sus compañeros. El acusado, para congraciarse tal vez con los officiales japoneses, convencia no solamente a ella sino tambien a sus padres para que dijeran que ellos prestaron servicio a las guerrillas. Por los maltratos, Anita ha tenido fracture en al esapula y un brazo dislocado.


Ya hemos mas de una vez que al guerill es una parte indispensable en toda guerra de resistencia, especialmente cuando el ejercito desorganizado por la invasion. Entonces es cuando la guerra de guerrillas es necessaria. Durante ocuppacin, la ayuda de la poblacion civil a las guerillas era necesaria. Y esa ayuda no se podia efectuar sino mediante intermediarios. Este papel desempeñaban las hermanas Bacani.


Para aislar a las guerillas de la poblacion civil — que les daba municiones de boca y guerra — habia necesidad de suprimir a los intermediarios. Por eso los japoneses hicieron implacable persecucion a los que ayudahan a las guerrillas. Emplearon la tortura en todas sus formas nunca imaginadas para sembrar el terror en todas partes. Y el acusado presto sus servicios en esta campaña no por la fuerza sino con gusto. Si las dos hermanas hubieran muerto como resultasdo de las torturas, no hay duda alguna, de que impondriamos al acusado la pena correspondiente al delito de traicion en toda su rigidez. Porque Rosario no murio sino  que fue convertida, en mala hora, en instrumento para saciarla sed sexual de Yozida, ¿ha de merecer menos pena el acusado? ¿Hay mayor desgracia y escarnio para una señiorita como estar a la merced de los caprichos bestiales de un oficial del orercito invasor? Hay que tener cuenta que rosario no era una traficante professional del placer: era una señorita de apenas 16 años de edad, y la perdida de su honra fue peor aun que la perdida de su vida. La Convencion de la Haya garantiza que ""family nohor and rights . . . must be respected"" y el acusado, a pesar de todo esto, ayudo a Yozida, un official enemigo, a deshonrar a ella. Sin su sayuda, Rosario no hubiera sido presa de una fiera en forma de official.


No hay pruebas que el acusado ayudaba a los soldados japoneses bajo compulsion; al contrario desempeñaba su cometido de espia y torturador con infulas de conquistador, induciendo aun a las hermanas Bacani y a sus padres que confesaran que ayudaron a las guerrillas. No creemos que la culpabilidad del acusado no sea grave como dice la decision. Por el, un oficial enemigo consiguio deshonrar a una doncella que espeor aun que matarla. Laq mujer de cualquier pais invadido tiene derecho a mejor suerte. De los hechos expuestos, no hay ni uno solo que pueda atenuar la responsibilidad del acusado. Las disponsiciones del Codigo Penal Revisado citadas en la decision son del tenor siguiente: ""No incurren en responsibilidad criminal: . . . 5.º El que obra violentado por una fuerza irresistible."" (Art. 12, par. 5.) ""Son circuntancias atenuantes: 1.
a 
Las expresadas en el capitulo anterior cuando no concurrieren todos los requisitos necesarios para justificar el acto, o eximir de responsibilidad en sus respectivo casos."" (Articulo 13, parrafo 1.º.) Estas disposiciones no son aplicables al caso presete, y, por tanto, no debe ser aplicada la pena en su grado minimo.


Por tales consideraciones, vote por que se confirme la sentencia del Juzgado 
a quo
: no estaba conforme en que se le imponga la pena en su grado minimo.


Como no habia mayoria suficiente en la votacion, se señalo otra vez a vista la causa de acuerdo con la Regla 120, articulo 12 que dispone que: ""When the court 
in banc 
is equally divided in opinion or the necessary majority can not be had, the case shall be reheared, and if in rehearing no decision is reached, the judgment of conviction of the lower court shall be reversed and the defendant acquitted.""


Si insisto en mi opinion que sostuve en la primera votacion, automaticamente quedaria absuelto el acusado, en menoscabo de la vindicta publica. Transigir para que no se frustren los fines de la justicia, como en el caso presente, no es claudicar.


Por tanto, concurro hoy con la mayoria: que se le imponga al acusado la pena en su grado minimo; pero que no se le absuelva, por una instransigencia injustificada.




PARAS, J. dissenting:


The appellant, Felix Alcover, as guerrilla, was caught two or three times by the Japanese military police and, to save his life upon the advice of Major Laput, he entered in the service of the Philippine Constabulary. Although charged with treason on several counts, the Solicitor General admits that only one count has been proved by the testimony of the witnesses. This concerns the arrest and torture of the Bacani sisters, Rosario and Anita, which took place on January 13, 1945. Appellant denies having taken part in said arrest and torture and alleges that at the time thereof, he was confined in the hospital because he was wounded by a gun-shot fired by an unknown person December, 1944, at the intersection of Sanciangko and Leon Kilat Streets. Naturally he should have been in the hospital until January, 1945. Against his testimony, there is only that of the offended sisters. The First had been a
 telefonista 
in the office of the Japanese , and the second was the mistress of a Japanese commanding officer the second was the mistress of Japanese commanding officer. Even if we admit the truth of their statements, we do not find in the acts imputed to the appellant clear proof of treason. He simply accompanied the Japanese soldiers at the request Bacalla, that the two sisters were members of the guerrilla. Their house was indicated by the bother of said sisters who also accompanied that Japanese. True, he gave the remarks ""to tell the truth"" while the persons arrested were in the garrison, evidently so as the soften the irate feeling of the Japanese. For all we know appellant's intervention had saved the lives of the sisters happened to provoke the enmity of said women when he made some derogatory remarks to the CIC about them. 


I vote to acquit the appellant.
