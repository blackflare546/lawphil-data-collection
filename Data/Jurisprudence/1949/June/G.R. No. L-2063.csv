The trial court found him guilty on four counts and sentenced him to 
reclusion perpetua 
and to pay a fine of P5,000 and the costs.


Appellant was the barrio lieutenant of the adjoining barrios of Cabulihan and Cagbuhangin, Ormoc, Leyte, since he came down from the mountains in August, 1942. 


Candida Udan testified that appellant reported to the Japanese soldiers that her son, Teofilo Aseledano, a supply sergeant of the guerrillas, was the one who cut the telegraph lines. Eduarda Aseledano, Teofilo's aunt testified that in the morning of March 21, 1944, five soldiers and appellant went to her house looking for Teofilo. Ciriaco Laguna, a barrio policeman, testified he that he arrested Teofilo as a guerrilla at about 3 o'clock p.m. of March 21, 1944, on orders of appellant, to whom he brought Teofilo. Appellant tied his back and, with Tirso Estrera, brought to the BC headquarters at Valencia. Basilio Cudilla testified that he saw appellant in his own house tying the hands of Teofilo on March 21, 1944, that appellant told yap, a BC officer, that Teofilo was a guerrilla, that Yap and appellant pummeled Teofilo with blows and that the Japanese soldiers took Teofilo to the garrison accompanied by appellant.


The above are the testimonies in support of count one of the information.


In support of count two, Sabina and Patricio Ibañez, sister and brother, testified that in May, 1944, leading a patrol of Japanese and BC soldiers, appellant went to their house in barrio Cabulihan looking for their guerrilla brother, Faustino Ibañez, who was not then in the house. Appellant, assisted by two Japanese and two BC soldiers, searched the house, after slapping Eutiquio Ibañez, and then took his mother and sister Anatalia Ibañez, as hostages at their garrison. 


In support of count four, Marcelo Lonzaga and his wife, Aniceta Chaquin, testified that about the last week of December, 1943, appellant came to their house in barrio Cagbuhangin, while Marcelo and his neighbor Damian Burlas were at the balcony. Shortly after, Japanese soldiers arrived. Appellant immediately took hold of Burlas and told the Japanese that the latter is a genuine guerrilla soldier they were looking for. Marcelo managed to escape unnoticed. 


In support of count five, the prosecution proved through the testimonies of Elpidio Ico and Demetrio Rita, that the latter was arrested one day of the last week of April, 1944, in a small house in Katayong. When Demetrio came down from said house, appellant seized and tied him aided by BC soldiers. Then they beat him hitting him on the lips with a stone after which Demetrio was taken to the Japanese garrison at Valencia where appellant told Elpidio to go home.


It appears that Demetrio was detained for three days during which the Japanese investigated about the guerillas and was only able to escape during an encounter between a Japanese patrol and the guerrillas in the mountains where he was taken by the Japanese patrol. 


After considering the evidence, were are not satisfied that the two-witness rule of article 114 of the Revised Penal Code has been complied with by the prosecution as regards count one of the information. There is no single overt act relating to said count upon which, at least, two witnesses had testified. 


Regarding the actuations of appellant in the Ibañez' house when the patrol of which he was a part was looking for a guerrilla, Faustino Ibañez, the testimonies of Sabina and Patrocinio Ibañez had satisfied fully the two-witness rule, and upon their testimonies conviction is fully justified.


The rule is also fully satisfied with the testimonies of Marcelo Lonzaga and his wife Aniceta Chaquin with respect to the of Damian Burlas, the subject of count four of the information. Under the same rule, there is enough basis to convict appellant of count five of the information regarding the arrest of Demetrio Rita testified to by the latter and Elpidio Ico.


Appellant tried to exculpate himself by alleging that he had been a guerrilla and by his claim that he merely tried to maintain peace and order as barrio lieutenant. We have already said in 
People vs. Victoria
, L-369 (44 Off. Gaz., 2230) that any meritorious service to the guerrilla movement, would not condone overt acts of treason. Furthermore, the acts perpetrated by appellant in searching for guerrillas, who are not criminals endangering the rights of peaceful people, cannot be justified as official functions of a barrio lieutenant for order. They were over acts of aid and to the enemy.


The facts proved by the evidence on record show that appellant, a Filipino citizen, is guilty beyond doubt of the crime of treason. The sentence rendered a him by the trial court being in accordance with law is affirmed with costs.
