OZAETA, 
J.
:


This is an appeal from the People's Court, which found the appellant guilty of treason on several counts and sentenced him to pay a fine of P10,000. 


Appellant, who was a member of the Ganap Party, admitted in open court that  he is a Filipino citizen. Several witnesses for the prosecution testified  to his adherence to the enemy by constantly accompanying members of the  Japanese military police, wearing an arm band with Japanese characters and  carrying a revolver, and causing the confiscation of personal properties  belonging to Filipino civilians and the arrest of civilians and guerrillas.  The following specific acts of the accused were proven by the prosecution by  the testimony of at least two witnesses to the same overt act:


1. In February, 1942, the accused accompanied several Japanese soldiers and some Filipinos to the barrio of Pineda, near Fort McKinley, Pasig, Rizal, and  searched the houses of Regino Santa Ana, Marcelo Espiritu, and Emilio Leron  for goods distributed by the United States Army before it left for Bataan,  and seized and confiscated from them palay, canned goods, shoes, clothes, and  other personal properties.  


2. One morning in the same month of February, 1942, the accused accompanied  several Japanese soldiers to the house of Aurelio Cruz in Mandaluyong, Rizal,  who arrested him and brought him to the Japanese garrison located in the  compound of the Insular Sugar Refining Corporation in the same municipality.  There he was investigated by the Japanese soldiers regarding the possession  of a firearm, which he denied.  


3. On or about September 25, 1944, Dr. Andres Torres of Mandaluyong, Rizal,  was arrested by Japanese soldiers at the indication of the accused and  brought first to the Insular Sugar Refining Corporation and then to the  Japanese garrison at Wack Wack, where he was charged with being a guerrilla  officer and spy of the USAFFE, and with treating sick or wounded guerrillas,  and investigated as to who his companions were. During the several days that  he was detained there, he was tortured and beaten with a club.  


4. About midday on September 24, 1944, five Japanese soldiers accompanied by  the accused raided the house of Atty. Saturnino Castillo in Mandaluyong,  Rizal, and arrested the latter and brought him to the Japanese garrison at  Wack Wack, where he was charged with being a guerrilla officer, tortured,  and sentenced to death. He was, however, saved at the last hour by the  intervention of his former Japanese client named Imamura.


5. About ten o'clock one night in February, 1943, the accused accompanied by  a Japanese officer and two soldiers arrested Edmundo (Eduardo) Chuakiko and  Antonio Sta. Teresa in Mandaluyong, Rizal, and brought them to the Japanese  garrison in the premises of the Philippine Hume Pipes, where they were  investigated concerning guerilla activities.


6. Felix Peralta, an enlisted man of the Philippine Army who was able to  escape from the Death March of Bataan and found refuge in the house of his  grandfather Joaquin Dimapili in Mandaluyong, Rizal, was arrested by the  Japanese at the indication of the accused in the early dawn of April 29,  1942, and later sent to the concentration camp in Capas, Tarlac, where he  remained confined for six months.


Testifying in his own behalf, the accused declared that during the early days  of the occupation and up to the end of 1942 he was engaged in buying and  selling cigarettes and other articles; that after that he obtained employment  as a guard in the Insular Sugar Refining Corporation, of which Mr. Marciano  Angeles was the superintendent; that he worked in that firm up to the end of  1943; after which he transferred to the Taiwan Pulp Factory, where he worked  as a chauffeur until February, 1944, and then ""came to Manila to deal in  cigarettes."" He denied having accompanied Japanese soldiers to rest civilians. He admitted having been investigated by the CIC, in which office he signed  a document (Exhibit A) and he admitted that the signatures therein was his,  although he claimed that he signed it without ""because I was afraid they  would maltreat me."" In Exhibit A, which was subscribed and sworn to by the  accused on May 12, 1945, before Jose B. Ingojo, Second Lieutenant, QMC,  Summary Court Officer, he gives his biographical sketch from the time he was  born in Caibiran Leyte, on August 3, 1907, until January 6, 1945, when  according to him he separated from Mr. Kawakami, the assistant manager of  the Taiwan Pulp Factory, in Talavera, Nueva Ecija. Among other things the  accused states the following in Exhibit A:




That about February 1942, Mr. Hikigi, a Japanese carpenter of the Insular  Sugar Refinery at Barrio Jolo, took me as driver for the Japanese garrison at  Barrio Jolo, Mandaluyong. This garrison was located in the house of Mr.  Marciano Angeles, Superintendent of the Insular Sugar Refinery at Jolo;  


That as driver of the Japanese Garrison I was given by Capt. Ochuka a .38 caliber revolver and provided with an arm band with Japanese characters;


That one night, at about eight or nine o'clock, in the month of February,  1942, I was ordered by Capt. Ochuka of the Japanese garrison to accompany the  Japanese soldiers who arrested the chauffeur of Dr. Andres Torres. I was with  the Japanese soldiers when they arrested Francisco, Dr. Torres' chauffeur,  and was with them when they carried him to the garrison. I found out that  Francisco was arrested as ""suspected ex-USAFFE soldier"" who did not  surrender to the Japanese Imperial Force. Francisco was released that same  night after investigation.




That statement of the accused, which we find from his testimony to have been  signed by him voluntarily, is admissible to contradict or impeach his  testimony during the trial.


The only other witnesses called by the defense were Marciano Angeles and  Numeriano Roxas. The testimony of these witness, however, does not disprove  that of the witnesses for the prosecution. Mr. Angeles testified that in the  latter part of 1943 a Japanese by the name of Kizi (probably the same man  referred to by the accused in his statement as Hikizi) recommended the  accused to him for employment as a guard in the Insular Sugar Refinery, but that the accused left in the early part of 1944 and transferred to the  Taiwan Pulp Kogyo Kaisha, which occupied a part of the compound of the  Insular Sugar Refinery. Mr. Angeles admitted on cross-examination that he saw  the accused going out with the Japanese although he did not remember how  many times.


Numeriano Roxas testified that in the latter part of December, 1943, he worked  as a draftsman for the Taiwan Pulp Factory and that he saw the accused there  working as a driver of the car used by the factory manager; that during his  stay there he did not see the accused in the company of any Japanese soldier.  On cross-examination he testified that he worked in the Taiwan Pulp Factory  only until the first week of February, 1944, and that he of course did not  know what happened there after he had left because he went to the provinces.


It will be recalled that the overt acts attributed to the accused by the  witnesses for the prosecution were committed in February and April, 1942,  February, 1943, and September, 1944, while the period covered by the  testimony of Marciano Angeles and Numeriano Roxas was limited to the latter  part of 1943 and the early part of 1944.


In this appeal the attack made by counsel 
de oficio 
in his lengthy brief  against the decision of the People's Court is entered mainly upon the  credibility of the witness for the prosecution.


After a careful examination of the evidence in relation to the errors  assigned by the appellant, we find no sufficient ground upon which to reverse  the findings of fact made by the trial court. We are persuaded that the  appellant committed the treasonable of which he is accused.


The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs.


Moran, C. J., Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Tuazon, Montemayor and Reyes, JJ.,
 concur.


Ozaeta, J.
, I certify that Mr. Justice Perfecto and Mr. Justice Pablo voted to affirm the decision of the trial court.
