Judge Catalino Buenaventura gave judgment for plaintiff without costs. This is an appeal from that judgment.


The gravamen of appellants contention is good faith. They cite three decisions one of which is 
Castillo vs. Valdez
, 53 Phil., 120 wherein the court said:




A purchaser for value who takes property upon the faith of the certificate so issued acquires a good title. Any other conclusion would be wholly inconsistent with the spirit and purpose of the Land Registration Law. Of course so long sa the property remains in the hands of the person who has acquired title irregularly he can be made to surrender the certificate to be cancelled. But it is not so with an innocent purchaser for value. . . .




Appellants citation do not fit into the facts of the present case. Good faith affords protection only to purchaser for value from the registered owner. Deogracias Evangelista, defendants grantor is not a registered owner. The land was and still is registered in the name of Casimiro Evangelista. In no way does the certificate of title state that Deogracias owned the land: consequently defendant cannot summon to their aid the theory of indefeasibility of Torrens title. There is nothing in the certificate and in the circumstances of the transaction which them in supposing that they needed not looked beyond the title. If anything it should have put them on their guard cautioned them to ascertain and verify that vendor was the only heir of his father that there was no debt and that the latter was the sole owner of the parcel.


If as is probably the case defendants relied on the court order adjudicating to Deogracias Evangelista the entire estate in the distribution held under Rule 74 of the Rules of Court their innocence avails them less as against the true owners of the land. That was a summary settlement made on the faith and strength of the distributes self-serving affidavit; section 4 of the above-mentioned rule provides that, ""If it shall appear at anything within two year after the settlement and distribution of an estate . . . that an heir or other person has been unduly deprived of his lawful participation in the estate such heir or other person may compel the settlement of the estate in the court in the manner herein provided for purpose of satisfying such participation."" Far from shielding defendants against loss the adjudication and the rule under which it was made gave them a clear warning that they were acting at their peril. ""A judicial partition in probate proceeding does not bind the heir who were not parties thereon. No partition judicial or extrajudicial could add one iota or particle to the interest which the partitioner had during the joint possession. Partition is of the nature of a conveyance of ownership and certainly none of the co-owner may convey to the other more than his own true right. A judicial partition in probate proceeding is not final and conclusive and not being of such definitive as to stop all mean of redress for a co-heir who has been deprived of his lawful share such co-heir may still within the prescriptive period bring an action for 
reivindicacion 
in the province where any of the real property of the deceased may be situated. Broad perspective of public policy are set out in the opinion of the court in support of the wisdom of allowing a co-heir the benefits of the law of prescription even after a partition judicial or extrajudicial has been had."" (Lajom 
vs.
 Viola, 73 Phil., 563. ) 


The judgment is affirmed with cost of this appeal against appellants.
