. They were tried by the judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal on the 24th day of October, 1903. During the trial Juan del Rosario and Cirilo Janto escaped from the custody of the law. After hearing the proof the court found the said defendants and each of them guilty of the crime charged, and sentenced Faustino Guillermo to the penalty of death, Anatalio Austria and Alejandro Santiago to life imprisonment, and Alejandro Hernandez, Antonio Galang, Pablo Tangco, Santiago Galagna, and Marcelino Flores each to be imprisoned for the term of twenty-five years, and to pay the costs. No appeal was taken from this judgment by any of the defendants.


The cause of Faustino Guillermo comes to this court in consultation under the provisions of section 4 of Act No. 194 of the United States Philippine Commission. During the trial many witnesses were presented on behalf of the prosecution. The prosecution also offered in evidence the following confession, made by Faustino Guillermo, which was duly accepted without objection:




DECLARATION OF FAUSTINO GUILLERMO. 


						MANILA, 
June 11, 1903.


My name is Faustino Guillermo, 43 years of age, a native of Sampaloc, in the city of Manila, and a widower. My present rank in the field is that of colonel. I was appointed by General San Miguel, now deceased, in the beginning of 1892 (1902?); my appointment was confirmed in the month of January, 1903, by the said General San Miguel. I took the field to fight against the Spaniards in 1896, in company with the supreme president, Andres Bonifacio, and remained in the field until the year 1900, when I surrendered at Malabon to the American colonel commanding the garrison at that town, and took the oath of allegiance to the American Government. 


I subsequently established myself at San Francisco del Monte, and was there captured by the Filipino police of Sampaloc in 1901. They took possession of all my documents, including the oath of allegiance which I took in Malabon. I was a prisoner for about three months and at the end of this time was liberated by Lieutenant Sweet, chief of the municipal secret police, who appointed me a spy. I was not willing to accept this employment, because it was repugnant to me, and I returned to the barrio of San Francisco del Monte, where I was again captured by the Constabulary, taken to San Mateo, and turned over to Inspector Licerio Geronimo, who compelled me to act as a spy for him, and set me at liberty by order of Captain Keythley. Finding myself free, I went to the mountains and commenced to recruit men, inviting my friends and acquaintances to join me.


The first troops I got together were nine men, called Anatalio Austria, Ismael Austria, Andres Roque, Geronimo de Leon, Eleuterio Seyco, Captain Silverio, Vicente del Mundo, Liberato Sarmiento, and Sixto Macapagal, of whom the first three were my nephews. General San Miguel appointed me a lieutenant-colonel; Anatalio Austria, major; Andres Roque, captain; Eleuterio Seyco, lieutenant; Silverio, captain; Vicente del Mundo, captain; Liberato Sarmiento, captain (this man is dead); and Sixto Macapagal, lieutenant. We then commenced to get arms together, looking for those which had been hidden by the revolutionists before surrendering, and succeeded in getting three guns and six or seven revolvers, which we captured from several detectives and municipal policemen. We were wandering about the woods, going from Rizal to Bulacan and 
vice versa
, living upon food given us by the people of the barrios. 


The first fight I had was in Masambon, in the beginning of 1902, with the Constabulary secret police. In this fight one of the Constabulary men was killed and we took his revolver. The second fight was with Inspector Licerio Geronimo in Bagobantay, in which one of the Constabulary men was killed, and we took his gun. The others ran away and we managed to pick up another gun. In this fight we also captured Hermogenes Bautista, known as General Menes, from whom we took his revolver. We also captured Aniceto, 
alias 
Goto, from whom we took a revolver. We also captured two policemen at San Juan del Monte, named Antonio Gatsalian and Pedro. We released all these men, but Antonio did not want to go away and remained with me until the fight at Pinquian on August 15, 1902, on which occasion he ran away with his gun. I recaptured him in April of this year, took his gun from him, and then released him. In this fight we also captured three horses from the Constabulary men, with their trappings and saddles, and also the uniform, hat, and shoes of Inspector Geronimo, who made his escape in his undershirt and drawers. The third fight we had was in the town of San Jose, Bulacan, which I entered at the head of sixteen men with fourteen guns. There we surprised the Constabulary garrison, composed of sixteen men, commanded by Sergeant Omano. We captured fourteen guns and two revolvers with their ammunition, which we carried away with us. The Constabulary men had no time to make resistance and there was no loss of life on either side. This fight took place on the night of the day in which I attacked Licerio Geronimo in Bagobantay, which was the 15th of June, 1902. 


On August 15, 1902, I had the fourth fight with the Constabulary, commanded by Inspector Reyes and Vicente, who were moving in two columns. In this fight the Constabulary lost one man whom I saw, and we captured Inspector Vicente and three soldiers, whom we disarmed, taking their three rifles and a revolvers with ammunition. We then took them to our headquarters, whence they made their escape a few days afterwards. This fight was at a place called Bahay Toro, within the township of Novaliches, Province of Rizal. On the same night we went to a place called Pinquian, within the township of Novaliches, and there we had an encounter with the Constabulary commanded by Inspector Warren. On our side we had three men killed, and captured a revolver and a gun. The Constabulary also lost several men killed, and captured three rifles from us. After this fight I went into the woods for the purpose of allowing my wounds to heal, and left my troops in San Francisco del Monte in charge of Apolonio Samson and Anatalio Austria. I was there for two months, after which I was sent for by San Miguel and joined my troops at a place called Tanque, where I found San Miguel, who put me in command of all the troops commanded by Julian Santos, who had usurped the commands of Samson and Austria. 


From Tanque we went to Piedad, in the township of Caloocan, and there we had an encounter with the Constabulary. In the fight we lost two men killed and one of our men was taken prisoner. We lost two rifles and a revolver, and one of the Constabulary officers was killed. We then went to Bignay (Polo), and there had a fight with the Constabulary under Inspector Lorenzo and an American. The Constabulary ran away, followed by us, and we captured four of their men and four guns. The men were released after being disarmed. From this place we went directly to Cainta, after resting a couple of days in Payon near Mariquina. Upon arriving at Cainta we attacked the Scouts and volunteers under Captain Teong. The Scouts and the volunteers took to fight and we captured some of their men. Just at this time reinforcements arrived for the Scouts, and a new fight broke out. The Constabulary ran away and we followed them as far as Tay-tay. In these fights we captured eight guns and a revolver. 


Thence we went to Antipolo, which town we entered and had a fight with the Constabulary, in the course of which we lost two men killed, our bugler was taken prisoner, and three guns were lost. Then we went to Boso-boso in the night and had a fight with the Constabulary, who took from us one carbine and one revolver. The Constabulary lost some men, but I did not see them. We were there some two weeks and had another encounter with the Constabulary, who, by reason of their superior numbers, compelled us to withdraw. From there we went to Piedad (Corral-na-Bato) and the same night had an encounter with the Scouts, the fight being suspended on account of the darkness of the night. On the day following we again attacked them, but were defeated with a loss of two men killed and three wounded and a loss of five guns. The Scouts also lost some men killed. In our retreat we encountered the reinforcements sent us by San Miguel, with supplies and ammunition, and then returned to seek the Scouts and Constabulary, attacking them again. In the course of the fight they killed one of our men and we lost a gun. The enemy had several men killed, and we captured three guns from them. The enemy fled in disorder. Subsequently further reinforcements of Scouts arrived and they again attacked us, compelling us to take to flight. We went toward Pugat-babuy and there encountered the Constabulary, whom we engaged, putting them to flight. We followed them as far as Polo and took four of their men prisoners and captured their guns. From there we went to Bignay, and other forces joined us under the command of Contreras and others. General San Miguel distributed troops, turning over to Vicente del Mundo 17 men, to Juan Alcantara, 
alias 
Castila, 19, to Captain Andres Roque 27, to Captain Geronimo de Leon 11, and to Captain Silverio 9. All these men were subject to my orders, under the direction of General San Miguel. Contreras commanded more than thirty men armed with guns, and was the chief of the Province of Bulacan.


From Bignay we went to Piedad again, and there we were attacked by the Constabulary and Scouts, who surrounded and defeated us, killing General San Miguel and many men, and capturing a large quantity of our documents and arms. After this combat we dispersed, and I went to Mount Laniting, near Boso-boso, with seven men and Alejandro Santiago Halimene. While there I sent four soldiers to look for provisions and to ask the president of Cainta for money, he having offered it to me before. These men did not return. One of them was my nephew, Geronimo de Leon. In Lanati I was captured by the Constabulary commanded by Captain Teong. I commanded the troops in the three towns of Caloocan, Novaliches, and San Francisco del Monte, the people of which voluntarily contributed men and supplies. I am personally acquainted with Maria Gonzalez Leaño, and have sent several letters to her asking for money and provisions. On one of these occasions I received 50 pesos, which she sent me by Juan Castila, who was sent to see her. This was in the month of December, 1902. 


In February, 1903, I went to Caloocan with thirteen men and established myself on the railroad line. From that place I sent Lieut. Juan Castila with two soldiers and a letter to Maria asking for money and provisions, and she promised to send them to me on the following day, but I did not receive them because I found it necessary to leave that place. I am also acquainted with Marcelino Estrella, who was inspector of Constabulary and a member of the secret police, when I was under the orders of Lieutenant Sweet. I have heard of Dominador Gomez and know that he is the president of the Democratic Labor Union. I have been a member of the Nationalist Party since its first organization, but have not had direct relations with it. It was Apolonio Samson who directly communicated with the Nationalists. In Boso-boso we took money from the municipality amounting to $69.90 in the month of August, 1902. 


I think that there are quite a number of guns still in the hands of my companions who remain in the field, but I can not state the exact number. The officers still in the field are Contreras, Apolonio Samson, Geronimo de Leon, Juan Castila, Basilio Mateo, and Mauricio. General San Miguel received a great deal of money from Manila for the support of the troops, but I can say who sent it. He had an agent who came to Manila to get the money, and whose name I do not remember. Everything I have said is the truth, which I affirm and ratify, and I sign this declaration voluntarily, without having been compelled thereto by threats or promises on the part of the employees of the division of information or any other officer.
