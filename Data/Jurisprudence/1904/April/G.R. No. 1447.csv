V. Miranda for appellants. 

Office of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee.


COOPER, 
J.:


The defendants, Perfecto de Leon, Ismael Francisco, Silverio de la Cruz, Domingo Inocencio, Andres de Lopio, and Vicente del Mundo, are charged with the crime of 
bandolerismo 
and were convicted by the Court of First Instance. 


Perfecto de Leon was sentenced to imprisonment for the period of twenty-eight years, Silverio de la Cruz and Vicente del Mundo to twenty-six years of imprisonment, Ismael Francisco and Andres de Lopio to twenty-four years of imprisonment, and Domingo Inocencio to twenty years of imprisonment. From this judgment the defendants have appealed to this court.


It is contended that there is no conclusive proof in the record which shows that the supplies and provisions taken in the towns were obtained by force and violence; nor is it plainly proven that the carabaos which were delivered to some of the party had been obtained by violence and intimidation employed against the possessors of said property; and further, that the organization had for its object to attack and contend with the Constabulary forces and municipal police of the towns for the purpose of appropriating to themselves arms and ammunition and to supply themselves for the purpose of forming an army for a future insurrection; in other words, that the band was of a political nature and that the appropriation of property by the band was for the purpose of supporting them in attaining political ends.


In several cases which have been decided by this court where it appeared that the organization of the party was of a political nature and that the members who formed such party or band committed acts coming within the definition of Act No. 518 against highway robbery or brigandage, they may be properly convicted under this Act.
