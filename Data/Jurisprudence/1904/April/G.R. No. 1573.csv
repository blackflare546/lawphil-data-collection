Canuto Mariano testified and stated that he knew the accused, and that he and his companions entered certain barrios and demanded food; that the band was composed of nine or more persons, and always went armed; that the people gave them food under threats which were made by the members of the said band and because of the fear that the people had of the said band. 


Florentino Andres testified that the accused, with his companions, stole his banca; that he recovered his banca later through the Constabulary, and that the defendant and his companions always went armed. 


Henry Knauber testified that he was an inspector of the Constabulary, and knew the accused; that the accused and his band took part in the fight between the Constabulary and the band of ladrones on March 20, 1903, at Corral-na-Bato; that the accused and his band were under the command of General San Miguel; that the accused and his band committed various robberies in the barrio of Cabcaben. 


The prosecution introduced in evidence a document captured by the Constabulary during the fight between the Filipino scouts and the band of ladrones under the command of General San Miguel on March 27, 1903. This document contained the names of a large number of persons, together with their rank and title. Among the names given appears the names of many persons heretofore sentenced by this court for the crime of 
bandolerismo
. The defendant's name appears in the said list as a member of the said band. A certificate is also attached to the said document, signed by Saturnino Pascual, who signs himself ""The Colonel Chief Organizer,"" who certifies that ""in acknowledgment of the services rendered to the mother country by Señor Tomas de Guzman I hereby authorize him to organize troops in the jurisdiction of Bataan, one of the provinces of this Tagalog land. 




Wherefore, I request every one of the sons of the people to recognize the said Señor and show him due respect, obeying his orders whenever they are lawfully issued.
