MORAN, 
C.J.
:


This is a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus 
filed in behalf of twelve persons alleged to be unlawfully detained by respondents Valeriano E. Fugoso, Lamberto Javalera and John Doe in their capacity as mayor, chief of police and officer in charge of the municipal jail of the City of Manila, respectively. It is alleged in respondent's return that ten of the petitioners had already been released, no sufficient evidence having been found to warrant their prosecution for inciting to sedition, but that the remaining two, Pascual Montaniel and Pacifico Deoduco, are being held in custody because of charges filed against them in the municipal court for unjust vexation and disobedience to police orders, respectively.


After hearing, by minute-resolution we dismissed the case with respect to the ten petitioners already released and we ordered the release of the remaining two, Montaniel and Deoduco, without prejudice to a reasoned decision which we now proceed to render.


The case of the ten petitioners has become academic by their release. The purpose of a writ of habeas corpus is only to set them free. After they are freed, the writ is purposeless. If they have been the victims of illegal arrest or detention, they can have recourse to criminal actions in the proper courts.


As regards the remaining two petitioners, the pertinent facts as admitted at the hearing by respondents, are as follows: Pascual Montaniel was arrested without warrant by the police officers of Manila on November 8, 1946, for inciting to sedition, and Pacifico Deoduco, on November 7, 1946, for resisting arrest and disobedience to police orders. On November 11 when this petition for habeas corpus was filed, these two petitioners were still under arrest. They were thus held in confinement for three and four days respectively, without warrants and without charges formally filed in court. The papers of their cases were not transmitted to the City Fiscal's office until late in the afternoon of November 11. Upon investigation by that office, no sufficient evidence was found to warrant the prosecution of Pascual Montaniel for inciting to sedition and Pacifico Deoduco for resisting arrest, but both remained under custody because of informations filed with the municipal court charging Montaniel with unjust vexation and Deoduco with disobedience to an agent of a person in authority under the second paragraph of article 151 of the Revised Penal Code. These informations were filed on the same day when this case was heard before this Court, that is, on November 12, 1946. And so far, no warrants of arrest or orders of commitment are shown to have been issued by the municipal court pursuant to the informations thus filed.


Under these facts, the detention of Pacifico Deoduco and Pascual Montaniel is illegal. Even assuming that they were legally arrested without warrant on November 7 and 8, 1946, respectively, their continued detention became illegal upon the expiration of six hours without their having been delivered to the corresponding judicial authorities. (Article 125, Rev. Pen. Code, as amended by Act No. 3940.) Their cases were referred to the City Fiscal late in the afternoon of November 11, 1946, that is, four and three days, respectively, after they were arrested. The illegality of their detention was not cured by the filing of information against them, since no warrants of arrest or orders of commitment have been issued by the municipal court up to the hearing of this case before this Court.


It must be observed, in this connection, that in said informations, the two petitioners are charged with light offenses punishable by law with 
arresto menor 
or a fine ranging from 5 to 200 pesos or both, according to the second paragraphs of articles 151 and 287, respectively, of the Revised Penal Code. Under the Rule 108, section 10, when the offense charged is of that character, ""the judge with whom the complaint or information is filed, shall not issued any warrant or order for the arrest of the defendant, but shall order the latter to appear on the day and hour fixed in the order to answer to the complaint or information,"" although in particular instance he may also ""order that a defendant charged with such offense be arrested and not released except upon furnishing bail."" The general rule, therefore, is that when the offense charged is light the accused should not be arrested, except in particular instances when the court expressly so orders in the exercise of its discretion. In the instant case, the municipal court has not yet acted on the informations nor exercised its discretion to order the arrest of the two petitioners and, therefore, they are still detained not because of the information filed against them but as a continuance of their illegal detention by the police officers. While an arrest maybe made without warrant when there are reasonable grounds therefor (Rule 109, section 6, Rules of Court), the prisoners cannot be retained beyond the period provided by law, unless a warrant is procured from a competent court. (4 Am. Jur., p. 49; Diers 
vs.
 Mallon, 46 Neb., 121; 50 Am. St. Rep., 598; Burk 
vs.
 Howley, 179 Penn., 539; 57 Am. St. Rep., 607; Karner 
vs.
 Stump, 12 Tex. Civ. App., 460; 34 S.W., 656; Johnson 
vs.
 Americus, 46 Ga., 80; Leger 
vs.
 Warren, L.R.A., 216-218 [Bk. 51.] It is obvious in the instant case that the City Fiscal had no authority to issue warrants of arrest (
vide
 authorities cited above, and Hashim 
vs.
 Boncan and City of Manila, 71 Phil., 216) and was powerless to validate such illegal detention by merely filing informations or by any order of his own, either express or implied.


It is not necessary now to determine whether the City Fiscal is a judicial authority within the purview of article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 3940, for even if he were, the petitioners' case was referred to him long after the expiration of the six hours provided by law. And since the City Fiscal, unlike the judicial authority, has no power to produce to order either the commitment or the release on bail of persons charged with penal offense (Adm. Code, section 2460), the petitioner's further confinement after their case had been referred to the City Fiscal was but a mere continuation of their illegal detention by the police officers. In the eyes of the law, therefore, these prisoners should have been out of prison long before the informations were filed with the municipal court, and they should not be retained therein merely because of the filing of such informations it appearing particularly that the offenses charged are light and are not, as a general rule, grounds for arrest, under Rule 108, section 10. Under such circumstances, only an order of commitment could legalize the prisoner's continued confinement, and no such order has been issued. Indeed, the municipal court could acquire jurisdiction over said prisoners only by the issuance of a warrant of arrest, an order of commitment or a writ of summons as provided in the aforementioned rule.


We reiterate the minute-resolution above mentioned.

PERFECTO, 
J., 
concurring:


The facts in this case can better be gathered from the pleadings. Copies of the petition and of the return, the latter with the annexes, accompany this opinion as appendices A and B.
1


At the hearing of this case, counsel of both parties disclosed the additional fact that the twelve detainees in whose behalf these proceedings have been initiated after their arrest, were required to post a bail bond for their provisional release of P12,000 each.


The petition was filed in the morning of November 11, 1946. The case was heard the next morning, and in the evening of November 12, it was possible for this Court to obtain the necessary majority for the early disposal of this case, with the result that the two remaining detainees were then immediately released. The first ten were released by respondents in the very afternoon of the day when the petition was filed.


If we could only have our own way, we would have the case heard and disposed of in the very day the petition was filed, by expediting the procedure in the same way as we did when we ordered the release on habeas corpus of Special Prosecutor Liwag, in Tañada 
vs.
 Quirino (42 Off. Gaz., 934). The Rules of Court, which provide that the writ of habeas corpus may be issued at any hour in the day or at night, and the very nature of the writ, make imperative the immediate disposal of cases like the present one, if the remedy is to be effective and there is an earnest desire to avoid a failure of justice, especially as respondents are bent on exerting all the power and ability at their command to mock at the action of the courts, as exemplified by the case of Villavicencio 
vs.
 Lukban (39 Phil., 778-812).


At the hearing of this case, our attention was called at the significant fact that petitioner himself, the ten released detainees, and other persons who came to attend the hearing in this Court, were refused entrance in the Malacañan compound where the building of the Supreme Court is located. They were allowed to come in after we asserted that all the people are free to come to the Supreme Court which is an institution that belongs to them.


The present case offers one of the most shocking examples of official disregard for fundamental human rights, as guaranteed in our Constitution, and as is intended to be promoted and encouraged by the Charter of the United Nations.


While Carlos P. Romulo, the eloquent spokesman of the Republic of the Philippines in the General Assembly of the United Nations, is making world history with his courageous sponsorship of the independence of all subjugated peoples and countries and is making for our Republic the proud record as one of the staunchest champions of fundamental human rights, always placed in the forefront whenever there is a battle for freedom, it seems paradoxical that here, in Manila, in the very heart of our country, in the nucleus of our national culture, twelve humble, peaceful and law-abiding citizens, while in the peaceful exercise of their constitutional rights of freedom of expression and to peaceably assemble, the right to enlist public support in the pursuit of their right to a decent living wage, and the right to petition their own Government for the redress of their grievances, are abruptly interrupted in the exercise of their rights and violently hauled into prison as dangerous criminals.


Counsel for respondents tried to justify the unwarranted official invasion of private civil liberties by the ignorance of erring officials of the Constitutional Bill of Rights. Such ignorance does not justify anything. It only aggravates the situation. It shows unpardonable dereliction of duty and recklessness of responsible high authorities.


It is a universal rule that ignorance of the law does not exempt anyone from any responsibility for violating it. They are also known as law officers, because it is their essential function to enforce the laws. They form part of the Executive Department of our Government, the department whose primary function is to execute the laws. No peace officers should be allowed to enter in the actual performance of his functions without first acquiring the indispensable knowledge of the laws they are called upon to enforce. At least they ought to know the Constitution, a copy of which they should always carry in their pockets for immediate consultation, with the same fidelity as the priests stick to their breviary of prayers. They should be compelled to learn by heart the Bill of Rights, if possible, commit to memory all its provisions. Peace officers are supposed, not only to enforce the laws, but also to protect the citizens in their rights, and in order that they may perform this duty, they should first know what these rights are. Without that knowledge, they become a menace to social order. If it is dangerous to let a person drive an automobile when that person does not know how to drive it, it is no less dangerous to entrust the enforcement of laws to armed individuals who are ignorant of them.


It has been alleged that the twelve detainees were not deprived of their personal liberty absolutely, because they were allowed to enjoy provisional release upon a bail of P12,000 each. If they choose not to post said bail, they cannot complain for having to remain in prison.


If the detention was illegal, and there is no doubt about it, respondents themselves admitting the illegality as to the ten detainees they released before the hearing of this case, the fact that respondent required them to post bail does not legalize their illegal detention. The bail requirements tends only to show respondents' stubbornness in insisting to enforce an illegal power to have the detainees under an involuntary control.


But even in the false hypothesis that respondents could require the detainees to post bail for their provisional release, the fact that respondents fixed the large amount of P12,000 for each, seems unbelievable sarcasm.


It is fact that the twelve detainees joined the worker's strike in a desperate endeavor to secure a decent living wage. They went into strike because with what they were being paid for their daily labor they had not enough to make both ends meet. At the time of their arrest, they were not even earning the insufficient salary or wage against which they were protesting by means of strike. If those persons were not earning enough to live as decent human beings, and at the time of their detention they were not receiving even the miserable pittance they were complaining of, it is not an insulting joke to require them to raise each P12,000 for bail, an amount, which even we, the members of the Supreme Court, occupying the highest rank in our judicial system, and receiving the highest salary allowed by law to a judicial officer, could not raise with the urgency required by the situation of a man who is deprived of his personal freedom?


It is also alleged that the officers who arrested the detainees believe that the latter committed sedition. Respondents themselves confess that the detainees did not commit such crime. Sedition is the crime usually resorted to by tyrants as a pretext to silence or suppress those persons who have the firmness of character to oppose them and expose their abuses. Socrates was sentenced to drink hemlock for the sedition of giving freedom and wings to the Greek thought in his painstaking philosophical search for truth. Because he preached the gospel of human brotherhood, Jesus was crucified for sedition.


The tyrants of one-fourth of a century ago, who controlled the situation in the Philippines — tyrants are wild animals that may appear in any country — following the foot-steps of their predecessors in other places, tried to smash the crusade for clean government, which was our lot towage in one of the newspapers of Manila, by prosecuting us for the crime of sedition. (United States 
vs.
 Perfecto and Mendoza, 43 Phil., 58,62-64.) The following paragraphs in the decision of the Supreme Court in that case, seem to us to ring with trenchant actuality:




When the citizens of a state convinced that the administration of the affairs of their government is not carried on in accordance with the law, or is not conducted for the best interest of all concerned, they have not only a right but it is their duty to present the case of their grievances to the public, and the free press of the state usually affords the best avenue for that purpose. To that end, the organic laws of all modern free states have wisely provided that ""no law shall be passed, abridging the freedom of the press"" and that no person shall be punished except for an abuse of that freedom. The interest of civilized society and the maintenance of good government demand a full and free discussion of all affairs of public interest. Complete liberty to comment upon the administration of the Government, as well as the conduct of the public men, is necessary for free speech. The people are not obliged, under modern civilized governments, to speak of the conduct of their officials, of their servants, in whispers or bated breath. (United States
 vs.
 Bustos, 37 Phil., 731.)


The right to assemble and petition the Government, and to make requests and demands upon public officials, is a necessary consequence of republican and democratic institutions, and the complement of the right of free speech. (United States 
vs.
 Bustos, 
supra
.)


The freedom of the press consists in the right to publish the truth, with good motives and for justifiable ends, although said publication may be offensive to the Government, to the courts, or to individuals.


Chief Justice Marshall of the Supreme Court of the United States, in discussing the freedom of the press, said: ""The spirit of the constitution and the opinion of the people cannot be curbed by those who administer the Government. Among those principles which are held most sacred by the people of America, there is none more deeply rooted in the public mind than that of the liberty of the press""


Mr. Daniel Webster had occasion to discuss the same question. He said: ""It is important to safeguard to the utmost the right to free speech and the free press. It is the ancient and constitutional right of our people to judge public matters and public men. It is such a self-evident right as the right to breathe the air and to walk on the surface of the earth. I will defend this high constitutional prerogative in time of war, in time of peace, and all the time. Dead or alive I shall maintain it.""


It is the particular duty of the people of the state to zealously maintain the right to express freely, either verbally or by publication, their honest convictions regarding the acts of the public officials and the governing class. If the people of the free state should give up the right of free speech; if they are daunted by fears and threats, and abdicate their convictions; if the governing body of the state could silence all the voices except those that extol their acts; if not relating to the conduct of the governing class can reach the people except that which will uphold the men in power, then we may well say ""Good-bye"" to our liberties forever. While under such circumstances free governments may still be maintained, their life, their soul, and their essentials will be gone. If the publication of the conduct of the public officials annoys them, let them examine their own act and determine the fundamental cause of the complaint. Even during the time of illustrious Voltaire, he expressed the opinion that ""tolerance was never the cause of internal strife in the state, but, on the contrary, the pursuit of intolerance has covered the world with blood. The tyrants of our thoughts have caused the greater part of the misfortunes of the world.""


Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson in discussing the question before us, said: ""If there were a country where knowledge could not be spread without incurring the penalty of the law; where there is no free speech, where correspondence and publicity are violated, that country would not be civilized, but it would be barbarous.""


Mr. Henry Ward Beecher on one occasion said: ""The term 'free' is akin to the wind that blows over the regions infected with malaria and exposes to the light and germs of the disease. When the freedom of speech is curtailed, infection sets in and death quickly follows.




Our schoolboys are no more compelled to count ""Ichi, ni, san, si,"" to sing ""Hamabe No Uta,"" to salute ""ohayoo,"" or ""kombanwa,"" or to intersperse their talk with ""arigatoo"" or ""sayoonara."" No more lecturer is teaching us the ""tyu no yu"" and flower arrangement as the highest expressions of culture. The political philosophy of ""Daitoa Kyoeiken"" (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, under the Japanese hegemony) has banished as unwanted nightmare. The voice of the Nippon geo-politicians preaching ""Hakko Ichiu,"" the Emperor's way, the universal brotherhood under the benevolent guidance of the direct descendant of Amaterasu Omikani, we do not hear any more. The bow-legged and be-sworded samurai successors, indoctrinated in the traditions of bushido knighthood, ceased to plunder, to rape, and to cut throats in our midst. Our sleep is no more disturbed by the hobnail terror stalking in our sidewalks at midnight. The public bowings to brutal sentries, and by high officials and employees of the government towards the Imperial Palace at Tokyo, are no more. But it seems, as exemplified in this case, that the feudalistic ideology behind all occupation facts and acts has left its pernicious in our soil.


The wanton disregard shown by those responsible for the arrest to the rights of the twelve detainees, those rights being among the fundamental ones guaranteed by the constitution, cannot be explained otherwise.


There was no absolutely legal ground to disturb or obstruct the twelve detainees in their absolutely lawful and peaceful activities, and much less to deprive them of their personal freedom and then keep them in jail for an indefinite period of time, only interrupted upon the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in this case.


It is our opinion that those government officers who are responsible for the detention and confinement of the twelve detainees, depriving them of personal liberty without due process of law, as guaranteed by the Constitution, are liable for prosecution under article 124 of the Revised Penal Code which provides as follows:




Arbitrary detention
. — Any public officer or employee who, without legal grounds, detains a person, shall suffer:


1. The penalty of 
arresto mayor 
in its maximum period to
 prision correccional 
in its minimum period, if the detention has not exceeded three days;


2. The penalty of 
prision correccional 
in its medium and maximum periods, if the detention has continued more than three but not more than fifteen days;


3. The penalty of 
prision mayor
, if the detention has continued for more than fifteen days but not more than six months; and


4. That of 
reclusion temporal
, if the detention shall have exceeded six months.


The commission of a crime, or violent insanity or any other ailment requiring the compulsory confinement of the patient in the hospital, shall be considered legal grounds for the detention of any person.




But even if the detention in question was made ""for some legal ground,"" a conjecture in support of which no sufficient ground appears in this case, still those who made the arrest are liable for prosecution under article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, because they failed to deliver the twelve detainees to the proper judicial authorities within the period of six hours after detention. Said article is as follows:




Delay in the delivery of detained persons to the proper judicial authorities
. — The penalties provided in the next preceding article shall be imposed upon the public officer or employee who shall detain any person for some legal ground and shall fail to deliver such person to the proper judicial authorities within the period of six hours. (As amended by Com. Act No. 3940.)




The idea of prosecuting them under the above cited articles of the Revised Penal Code may appear to be hard, but we must not forget that ""dura lex, sed lex"" and whatever may be the consequences the law must be given its way.


We can imagine how the erring officials will feel at the prospective prosecution and how they might consider unbearable the idea of being sent to jail, but was it sweet or delicious for the twelve detainees to be illegally deprived of their freedom and confined in prison for so many days and nights, without any fault on their part at all? If respondents are zealous in keeping their own personal freedom, they cannot deny the victims of their recklessness the same legitimate desire.


Everybody can imagine the indescribable physical, mental and moral sufferings endured by the twelve detainees and their respective families. The indignation felt by one who is the victim of unjustifiable onslaught upon his individual dignity, the paralyzing anguish of the down-trodden who feels overwhelmed by brutal superior force against which his weakness cannot offer but the answer of futile despair, the excruciating thought of the alarm their absence will produce in their humble little homes, where their unprotected wives will try to drown their worries in bitter tears, while their little ones are trying to understand in infantile amazement the absence of their father and the tragedy entailed by that absence, are things that can hardly be attenuated by the thought that, after all, the Nippon kempei has already banished as an asphyxiating dream, and the unfortunate situation cannot be as bad as the sadistic and bestial horrors that the very mention of Fort Santiago conjure in our imagination, the mere memory of which produces thick sweat and blood congelation. There is no treasure in the world that can adequately compensate such sufferings. The only consolation that the situation may offer is the bereft hope that such sufferings may have the effect of awakening the conscience of our public officials so as to induce them to make the firm resolve to avoid the repetition of such abuses as the ones depicted in this case, that the guilty ones will earnestly repent of their misdeeds and will henceforth endeavor to accord the proper regard to the rights and liberties of their fellow human beings, thus contributing to diminish so many rampant manifestations of moral misorientation, including attempts to degrade the highest tribunal of the country, that now offend the good sense of the average citizen.


The provision of law punishing arbitrary or illegal detention committed by government officers form part or our statute books even before the advent of American sovereignty in our country. Those provisions were already in effect during the Spanish regime; they remained in effect under the American rule; continued in effect under the Commonwealth. Even under the Japanese regime they were not repealed. The same provisions continue in the statute books of the free and sovereign Republic of the Philippines. This notwithstanding, and the complaints often heard of violation of said provisions, it is very seldom that prosecutions under them have been instituted due to the fact that the erring individuals happened to belong to the same government to which the prosecuting officers belong. It is high time that every one must do his duty, without fear or favor, and that prosecuting officers should not answer with cold shrugging of the shoulders the complaints of the victims of arbitrary or illegal detention.


Only by an earnest enforcement of the provisions of articles 124 and 125 of the Revised Penal Code will it possible to reduce to its minimum such wanton trampling of personal freedom as depicted in this case. The responsible officials should be prosecuted, without prejudice to the detainees' right to the indemnity to which they may be entitled for the unjustified violation of their fundamental rights.


The question of an economic rehabilitation of our country is an everyday topic in the newspapers. We deem more important still the moral rehabilitation of our people; especially that of the officialdom. The Constitution requires (section 5, Article 41) that ""All schools shall aim to develop moral character, personal discipline, civic conscience, and vocational efficiency and to teach the duties of citizenship,"" and it will be highly desirable that this mandate should be borne in mind all officers of the government, and that the qualities The Constitution ordains to be developed in all citizens should be, with more emphasis, required from officials and employees of the government, thus correcting the negative tropism shown in this case in regard to fundamental civil liberties.


The filing of information for insignificant misdemeanors against Pascual Montaniel and Pacifico Deoduco appears to us as a poor face-saving device to justify, in some way, their further detention, and should not be countenanced as a means to defeat the release of said two detainees.


In explaining in this concurring opinion, our position in voting in favor of the resolution of November 12, 1946, we wish to make clear that we do not interpret article 125 of the Revised Penal Code as legalizing detentions not exceeding six hours. Said article does not legalize an illegal detention. It only offers a justifying circumstance which exempts the erring officials from criminal prosecution, provided that the detention is made upon legal grounds and do not last more than six hours, but it will, and cannot, defeat a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person illegally detained although the petition is filed before the termination of the six hours period mentioned in the article, as the constitutional guarantee of personal freedom is not subject to any time limit.


We wish to emphasize that it is highly dangerous to make the fundamental rights to the citizens a kind of shuttlecock of passing moods or momentary whims of persons wielding some kind of government powers. When the oestrous of official intolerance and braggadocio employed to cow into submission the twelve detainees has subsided, everybody will recognize in the cool and serene recesses of their conscience, that those who, under the pretext of subduing allegedly seditious persons; committed the arbitrariness complained of in the petition, trod a perilous path that, as shown by the experience of other countries, usually lead to the implantation of a dictatorship, whose whole philosophy is built upon the hateful slogan that everything, including the most cherished possessions and the most blessed ideals of the people, should be sacrificed for the sake of the state supremacy.


We are glad that two civic-minded groups of citizens, the Philippine Civil Liberties Union and the Philippine Lawyers Guild, have taken pains to appear in this Court in behalf of the twelve detainees, and we congratulate them for the success of their endeavors.


By actual personal experience and upon conclusive evidence, we know that it is not enough that the civil liberties and fundamental human rights be guaranteed in express constitutional provisions in order that they should effectively be protected. Eternal vigilance and constant willingness and readiness to fight for them are necessary.


When World War I was nearing its end, in the exercise of the freedom of the press, guaranteed by the Jones Law, as Editor of 
La Nacion
, we made exposures of many unsatisfactory aspects of public affairs as they were then conducted. We made revelations regarding the scandals of the Philippine National Bank which caused many millions of losses to our Government. The powerful wanted us to be silenced. The Governor General, first through his Secretary, Mr. Irwin, and later through General Crame,Chief of the Philippine Constabulary, tried to intimidate us with drastic action by the Government if we should not stop the publications of the irregularities and illegalities we were denouncing then in the columns of our paper. They reminded us that the war justified any extraordinary measures by the Government, and that our denunciations, by tending to destroy public confidence in the authorities, were highly seditious. Our invariable answer to Mr. Irwin and General Crame was that the Governor General and they themselves were free to do what it would please them, but nothing shall deter us from doing what according to our conscience, was our public duty. As we did not allow ourselves to be intimidated, a series of criminal prosecutions were instituted against us. Although the lower courts should invariably find us guilty, the Supreme Court had always acquitted us, by upholding the freedom of the press.


The existence of the liberal elements, always watchful and ready to defend the victims of violations of the Bill of Rights, is necessary to vitalize democracy and to give tangible reality to the guarantees of the Constitution. The fight for personal freedom must go on, over and over again, as the forces of reaction are always ready to snatch any opportunity to set at naught the guarantees of the fundamental laws, as happened in the bail incident in 
People vs. Jalandoni 
(G.R. No. L-777),and all liberal forces must always be ready to answer the summons of endangered liberties.


The attainment of great ideals needs faith, passionate adherence to them, the militant attitude manifested in the unflinching readiness to fight and face hardships and sacrifices, unconquerable steadfastness and unbreakable perseverance in the face of obstacles and setbacks. These are the conditions and qualities with which thinkers and philosophers were able to discover the truth which have guided humanity as beacons in the path of progress; the founders of great religions, to transmit to millions their message of hope and gospel of eternal moral principles: Columbus, to discover the New World, and Magellan to transverse the two largest oceans and encircle the globe; astronomers, to pierce the immensity of space to conquer new stars, parsecs away; bacteriologists, to scavenge dangerous micro-organisms; scientists, to fossick in the mysteries of matter to wrest new revelations which enhance the intellectual horizon of man increase his means for enjoyment of life and happiness. The same conditions and qualities are among those needed by all liberal and progressive spirits to keep lighted the torch of liberty, to squelch the hydra of reaction, to conserve the moral heritage of advancement and conquest in the emporium of human rights bequeathed by the champions and martyrs who waged the heroic battles for real spiritual values and for the dignity of man as the image of God.
