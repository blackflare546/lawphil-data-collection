The fact that appellant has been an informer and a member of the 
Kempei-tai
 has been established, not only by the evidence presented by the prosecution, but also by the testimony of the accused himself, who, however, claims (a) that he was forced into the service by the enemy and (b) that his employment was a fact known and sanctioned by chieftains of the guerrilla outfits which governed Manila in their spheres of activities. Both defenses were rejected by the lower court.


At the hearing of this case on August 16, 1946, appellant made the admission that he is a Filipino citizen.


Eleven witnesses testified for the prosecution.


1.	Odon Alimañgohan, 42, residing at 1535 Felix Huertas, Manila, testified that during the Japanese occupation he came to know the appellant one night in a gambling house at the corner of Oroquieta and Quiricada streets.

Appellant often visited Dodong, a friend of the witness, who saw him twice carrying firearm. The witness knows that appellant was a member of the 
Kempei-tai
. He asked the witness if he wanted to work with the 
Kempei-tai
. The witness did not join it, ""because the Japanese refused to accept me.""


2.	Zoilo Rufino, 22, married, residing at 1255 M. Hizon, Manila, testified that he came to know appellant during the Japanese occupation because their homes are near each other, witness' house located in Sales Street, and appellant's in Comandante street. In 1944, the witness was arrested by Domingo Santiago, informer of the Japanese. He was taken to the house of the appellant in Comandante street. There he saw five men, including appellant, and a woman. He was detained there for about four days and was investigated and maltreated by Domingo Santiago, who was asking for the whereabouts of his brother. Appellant was staying in the house at night time. On the first night, the witness was placed under the house, but on the following days he was brought up. When he was arrested he was tied but after two days he was untied. Appellant saw the witness being tied. A few hours after his arrival in the house, a Japanese appeared who ""told us that we are bad men; but when we refused to admit he told us that it is better for us to die because in that case they will not be taking the trouble of covering our bodies with newspapers."" Witness' brother was also arrested. The witness was released by order of appellant who did not impose any condition. The witness was released ahead of his brother. Domingo Santiago was asking the witness P20,000 for his release. The witness told him that he cannot afford that amount because his earning is only enough for his needs.

They went inside the house and they saw Ponciano, who is also an uncle of the witness. Appellant asked Ponciano for his son, but Ponciano answered that he did not know where his son was.

After that, I was called again by the MPs an d I was investigated and I saw Vicente Reyes had really presented evidence against me and I saw the evidence were clear, and so I admitted that I am the highest ranking officer of the guerrillas in the Central Luzon. The Japanese officer told me that if really my intention was to help my countrymen, then I should accept a position with them in the pacification of my countrymen. At first they offered me the position of Japanese informer. I refused this position, and what I suggested was employment in the office, in their management of the peace campaign. The Japanese did not accept my offer to work in their office, and instead they made me the head of ten Filipino agents in the Kempei-tai and they told me that if I would not accept this position, the Japanese would kill me and will behead all the members of my family. I accepted the position that they gave me and after that I reported to my squadron and other guerrilla men and I related to them what happened to me. The emissary whom I sent to different guerrilla units to relate my plight, named Leonor Francisco, came back to me and he told me that those people told him to tell me to continue also to help the guerrillas. I selected real guerrilla men, mostly ex-USAFFES and other people entrusted the communication that I sent to those different guerrilla units."" The witness had connections with Squadron 29, USAFFE, that is Ramsey, at that time in Cabanatuan; with Lt. Teofilo Francisco stationed at Meycauayan, Bulacan; with Roberto Simbol stationed at Bataan; with Col. Pacifico Briones stationed at Pinatubo Mountains; he was sending communications to the unit under Dominador Basco. There were also several small units of guerrillas with whom the accused had had connections, among those were the unit at Dapitan, under Col. Marking, the unit at corner of Oroquieta and Zurbaran, under Wenceslao Lamsen, and that under Capt. Leon Pichay, in Manila. ""Upon my employment in the Japanese Military Police, the first step that I did was to select seven trusted genuine guerrillas, and to these seven men entrusted the communications that I sent to the underground and to several guerrilla units. Then, among the ten men given to me by the Japanese of whom I was the head, I dismissed seven of them, and I retained in my office three ganaps. I cannot dismiss all of them, because this will arouse the suspicion of the Japanese, so I have to retain three in my office. Whenever there was a raid proposed by the Japanese to be made, the first step that I did was to warn the people there to transfer to another place, and after that, I report back to our office and reported to the Japanese that there was no guerrilla in said place; however, if they are not satisfied with the report and they wanted to raid the said place, they can do it because I am satisfied that they could not find any person there, because I warned them beforehand. Take, for example, the unit under Commander Dominador Tombo. At the beginning of the year 1943, Capt. Tombo and myself were already wanted by the Japanese in the province, so we went here in Manila. This Capt. Tombo, everytime he came to Manila, the first thing that he did was to report to me, telling me that they are here, and they came here with ten of fifteen men, and asked my advise or what advise I can give him. Then I told them to go to a certain place, giving him the number of my telephone, so that in case of danger they might call me and as a matter of fact, up to the middle of the year 1944, when Capt. Tombo returned to the province, nothing happened to them, and even I gave them my revolver and ammunitions. Another case is about the headquarters commanded by Capt. Wenceslao Lamsen, in the City of Manila, corner Zurbaran and Oroquieta. This headquarters was being closely watched by the Japanese Military Police. Inasmuch as one of my activities  was to protect the guerrillas, I contacted Capt. Lamsen and I told him that his headquarters was being watched by the Japanese, and I told him that the best way to do, inasmuch as the building that he used as headquarters was composed of two stories, was that I will occupy the second story, so that I can camouflage the activities of the guerrillas, and in case the building will be raided, the Japanese will find out that I am using the first floor as my office. So, when the Japanese came to raid the place, I was confident that they could not find any guerrilla men in said building. When Capt. Lamsen approached me and asked me to do whatever I can, so that he will not be able to manage guerrilla unit. I did what I could to prevent the Japanese from employing him, and I succeeded in this. Then, another fact happened to Capt. Wenceslao Lamsen, when one night in November, 1944, at about 8 o'clock, the Military Police of the Airport Studio raided the place of Capt. Lamsen. I was the one who happened to be there, and when the Japanese Military Police found me, they asked me why I was there, and I said that I was occupying the place as temporary office; then the Japanese searched the place and found nothing, and they left.""


The witness testified also that one Manuel Gallego was wanted by the Military Police. He warned him and so Manuel Gallego was not arrested by the Japanese. Gallego was the representative from the Second District of Nueva Ecija. The witness used to help civilians coming from the provinces and arriving at Tutuban so as to prevent their rice from being confiscated by the Military Police. He also used to help peaceful guerrillas when they were being maltreated by the Japanese. Jose Fernandez, a lieutenant in the Ramsey Unit at Meycauayan ""was arrested by the Japanese but my runner came immediately and reported to me that Jose Hernandez was arrested by the Japanese so I went at once to a superior officer to tell him that the person arrested is one of my men who is helping me in my peace campaign. I was able to convince the superior officer, and Jose Hernandez. The same is true with respect to Vicente Nuñez, of Squadron 4, when he was arrested by Vicente Reyes and Buenaventura — I interceded in their behalf, and through my intercession, they were released."" ""While I was under detention in the month of May, Ponciano Briones was arrested by Vicente Reyes and one Ruperto Adriano, and I came to know this fact, because Vicente Reyes and Ruperto Adriano told me that they had arrested Ponciano Briones. After he was investigated he was released."" The witness had nothing to do with the detention and maltreatment of Ponciano Briones. In December, 1944, Jose Nogoy, nephew of Ponciano Briones, brought from Cabiao a machinery which was confiscated by agents of the Japanese Military Administration. Ponciano Briones approached the accused requesting him to recover back the machinery or its costs, which was P4,000. The witness was able to recover only P3,000 and for his failure to recover the remaining P1,000, Ponciano Briones harbored resentment against him. Last September, 1944 I, together with my men, arrested Gregorio Hernandez in his house because there was a complaint against him that he, together with other Texas men extorted five thousand pesos from Pablo Pastaño and Estanislao Ordoñez. After arresting him, I brought him to my office, and while I was investigating him he told me that he left the five thousand pesos to his companions. Then I gave him some warning, and then I sent him home after taking the five thousand pesos from him. Since the month of June, 1944, I met Juanita Rosales, in one of the houses of prostitution and Juanita Rosales was one of the inmates of that house and I came to know her and came to have understanding with her: we agreed to live with each other. Her name was not Juanita Rosales — she was Juanita Ibañez, according to her certificate. We lived each other for ten months, since June, 1944. While we were in Jaen, Nueva Ecija, about the end of March, 1945, Juanita Rosales told me that Gregorio Hernandez had been sweetheart before the war. Before April 27, 1945, I discovered that Juanita Rosales returned back to her old business in Jaen, Nueva Ecija, and I scolded her and I told her to leave. She returned here to Manila and I even gave her P20 for her transportation expenses. I met her at the headquarters of the guerrillas at Meycauayan on April 27, 1945. Nothing happened to us. When she came to the headquarters of the guerrillas at Meycauayan she reported to the guerrillas that I was an agent of the Japanese Military Police."" The accused had Abraham Albines arrested because he ""was in company with Gregorio Hernandez in their thieveries."" Because Consolacion Tongol was sick, ""she asked Lt. Leonor Francisco to fetch me. Upon my arrival at the house of Consolacion Tongol I asked her why she sent for me. She told me that she was sick and she wants to be hospitalized in the city. Then I told her to be prepared and I will conduct her to the hospital in the city. She told me that her money and clothes were placed at different places, and the best time for her to start was on the following day. I took my lunch in her house, and after lunch, she told me that she will get her clothes in the laundry; but after 30 minutes, a group of Japanese, accompanied by the Municipal Mayor of the town came to raid the house, and I was one among those arrested in the house. When I asked the Japanese why he was arresting me, told me that I was denounced as a bad man. Then I showed to them my identification card, and the Japanese then found that I was a bad man. I was conducted to the office of the Military Police in the town and there in the office I saw Consolacion Tongol. We slept in the town of Arayat that night, and that night I learned that Consolacion Tongol was kidnapped by guerrillas, and on the following morning I returned to Manila. Consolacion Tongol was the nurse of our guerrilla unit."" The witness does not know anything about Gabriel Tongol. The second time the accused went to Arayat was because he was sent for by the barrio people of Candating and by the head of the guerrilla unit. They asked him to intercede with the Japanese authorities who have committed many abuses against the population. ""Upon my arrival I remonstrated with the Japanese military authorities and I transmitted to them the plight of inhabitants of the barrio. On my arrival there in the barrio of Candating, the town mayor gathered the people of the barrio, and about 300 people gathered there, and the mayor separated those who were not guerrillas and he denounced the guerrillas to the Japanese. I interceded for them and explained to the Japanese that those people were not guerrillas, they were simply farmers, and I explained to the mayor that with that system there will be no peace in the town. I quarrelled with the mayor, because the mayor was insisting that those men who were segregated were guerrillas, and as a result of which I quarrelled with him. to save those people, I selected one person by the name of Mabini, and I gave him instructions as to what he should do, that somebody should be sacrificed, that he should suffer, because that would be their only salvation. He followed my instructions, and they were saved. I took hold of this person named Mabini, and I investigated him in the presence of the Japanese, and I even slapped both of his face, and this man insisted that he is not a guerrilla, that he is a peaceful farmer. Then the Japanese approached us, and they asked what the person was trying to explain, and I told the Japanese that he was saying that he was not a guerrilla, that he was a peaceful farmer, but that we could not understand each other. Then the Japanese explained to me. I exerted my efforts to convince the Japanese that I was really investigating, and because of that they were saved."" After his mission in Candating, he returned to Manila, ""Upon my return here in Manila, I closely watched the activities of the Japanese Military Police, and I stole the plan and sketches of the places here in Manila and suburbs to be zonified by the Japanese; and one time I was able to steal from the car of Colonel Takano, here in Escolta, the plans and sketches of the different places here in Manila and suburbs that were to be zonified; and as a matter of fact, the loss of those maps created a furor here in the city among the Japanese, and they have offered a reward of ten million pesos for the recovery of said sketches and maps. They were not recovered, because I sent said maps and sketches to the guerrilla officer, Capt. Antolin Rosales; and as a matter of fact what happened then was that even the detectives at the City Hall were arrested here in Manila, and some of them were brought to my office and were investigated. Then I helped in the arrest and investigation of the ""texas"" here in Sampaloc and Quiapo. When the American liberating forces arrived here in the city, February 3, 1945, I went with Capt. Wenceslao Lamsen, and I indicated to him the places of danger that may endanger the lives of Americans and guerrillas; and after that I proceeded to Jaen, Nueva Ecija.""


After the witness joined the Japanese 
Kempei-tai
 and he was made the head of a group of ten men, he separated seven among them, but he could name only one Johnny, one Tony, one Pedro and one Ruperto. He forgot their surnames. In 1942, he left Nueva Ecija because of the fact that he sensed that he was being pursued and wanted by guerrillas and the Japanese and by the peace officers of Cabanatuan or Cabiao. After he was made head of a group of Filipino agents, the accused enjoyed absolute freedom and he could escape. The Japanese ""had not trusted me, so they were always suspicious of me. I had access to their offices, because at times they called us or investigated us.""


9.	Dominador Panis, 28, married, sportsman, residing at 772 Tayabas, Manila, testified that he has known Jose Fernando before the war. Fernando knew pretty well that the witness was active in the resistance movement. They dined together many times, and the accused told him several times of raiding certain places. In November, 1944, the witness was arrested by the Japanese and brought to the Airport Studio where he was released. At the garrison, he was tortured and several scars of his face show the effects of his torture. I saw the accused once inside the Airport Studio.


After carefully weighing the above testimonies, we are convinced that the prosecution has been able to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that appellant, being a Filipino citizen, had adhered to the cause of the Imperial Government of Japan, by giving aid and comfort to their military forces stationed in the Philippines during the enemy occupation, having served as informer and active member of the 
Kempei-tai
, the Japanese military police organization, having arrested Ponciano Briones, Gregorio Hernandez, Abraham Albines and Gabriel Tongol as guerrilla suspects or having immediate connection with guerrilla suspects, in an attempt to suppress the underground resistance movement. I proving the overt acts imputed to appellant, the two-witness rule provided by article 114 of the Revised Penal Code has been fully satisfied.


Appellants claim that he was forced into the service of the 
Kempei-tai
 by the enemy appears to be without merit. The circumstances under which he alleges having been forced by the Japanese to serve them seem to belie his allegation. It is incredible that, while appellant was undergoing detention and maltreatment for his alleged connection with the resistance movement, the Japanese should, without much ceremony, upon appellant's show of willingness to abide by their order to serve them, release him, provide him with firearms, and put under his charge a group of Filipino informers in the service of 


Kempei-tai
. To place appellant in such a responsible position, full of opportunity and means either of helping the Japanese or sabotaging their military efforts, appellant must beforehand have shown them strong evidence of adherence and loyalty for the Japanese to trust him.


If appellant's claim of unwillingness was true and he was helping the underground resistance movement at heart, he offered no explanation for his failure to take advantage of the freedom granted him during the long months of service in the 
Kempei-tai
 by fleeing from the enemy to join the guerrilla forces or by sabotaging the military efforts of the Japanese. His corroborated claim of having stolen zoning maps appears to be too flimsy to be believed, not only because appellant has not shown any military usefulness in said theft, but also because the Japanese needed no maps for their zonings which they practiced in a haphazard and indiscriminate way. That appellant, instead of fleeing from, or sabotaging the efforts of, the enemy should have made arrests and investigations to actually help the Japanese in their campaign for the suppression of guerrilla activities, makes wholly unacceptable his claim of having entered the service of the 
Kempei-tai
 involuntarily.


Appellant's allegation that his employment in the 
Kempei-tai
 was known and approved by guerrilla leaders is a gratuitous allegation without any reliable evidence to support it. Not a single guerrilla leader or guerrilla soldier was called by appellant to support or corroborate him in his claim.


At any rate, even on the hypothesis that appellant's claim of his involuntarily induction into the 
Kempei-tai
, and that said induction was approved by the guerrilla chieftains, have been proved, they cannot exculpate him from criminal responsibility for the arrests and investigation of guerrilla suspects and their relatives and for the punishments and tortures inflicted by him on them, as conclusively proved by the evidence on record, as with said overt acts he helped the military purposes of the enemy, with no other purpose than to show his adherence and support to the Japanese cause in the last war.


Appellant never claimed that he made the arrests and investigations and inflicted the punishments and tortures impelled by force or induced by insurmountable fear of the Japanese, which, if proved, would relieve him from criminal responsibility, nor with the knowledge and approval of guerrilla leaders, which, even if accepted, would not exculpate him of rather make said leaders answerable with appellant for the crime of treason.


The appealed decision is affirmed with costs against appellant.


Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, Hilado, Bengzon and Tuason, JJ., concur.


PARAS, J.:


In the result. Appellant caused the arrest of many persons who have been severely punished illegally.
