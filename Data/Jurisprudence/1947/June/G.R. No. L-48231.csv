HILADO, 
J.
:


This is an appeal by Wise & Co., Inc. and its co-plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila in civil case No. 56200 of said court, absolving the defendant Collector of Internal Revenue from the complaint without costs. The complaint was for recovery of certain amounts therein specified, which had been paid by said plaintiffs under written protest to said defendant, who had previously assessed said amounts against the respective plaintiffs by way of deficiency income taxes for the year 1937, as detailed under paragraph 6 of defendant's special defense (Record of Appeal, pp. 7-10). Appellants made eight assignments of error, to wit:


The trial court erred in finding:


I. That the Manila Wine Merchants, Ltd., a Hongkong corporation, was in liquidation beginning June 1, 1937, and that all dividends declared and paid thereafter were distributions of all its assets in complete liquidation.


II. That all distributions made by the Hongkong corporation after June 1, 1937, were subject to both normal tax and surtax.


III. That income received by one corporation from another was taxable under the Income Tax Law, and that Wise & Co., Inc., was taxable on the distribution of its share of the same net profits on which the Hongkong Company had already paid Philippine tax, despite the clear provisions of section 10 of the Income Tax Law then in effect.


IV. That the non-resident individual stockholder appellants were subject to both normal and additional tax on the distributions received despite the clear provisions of section 5 (b) of the Income Tax Law then in effect.


V. That section 25 (a) of the Income Tax Law makes distributions in liquidation of a foreign corporation, dissolution proceedings of which were conducted in a foreign country, taxable income to a non-resident individual stockholder.


VI. That section 199 of the Income Tax regulations, providing that in a distribution by a corporation in complete liquidation of its assets the gain realized by a stockholder, whether individual or corporate, is taxable as a dividend, is ineffective.


VII. That the deficiency assessment was properly collected.


VIII. That the refunds claimed by plaintiffs were not in order, and in rendering judgment absolving the Collector of Internal Revenue from making such refunds.


The facts have been stipulated in writing, as quoted verbatim in the decision of the trial court thus:


I


That the allegations of paragraphs I and II of the complaint are true and correct.


II


That during the year 1937, plaintiffs, except Mr. E.M.G. Strickland (who, as husband of the plaintiff Mrs. E.M.G. Strickland, is only a nominal party herein), were stockholders of Manila Wine Merchants, Ltd., a foreign corporation duly authorized to do business in the Philippines.


III


That on May 27, 1937, the Board of Directors of Manila Wine Merchants, Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as the Hongkong Company), recommended to the stockholders of the company that they adopt the resolutions necessary to enable the company to sell its business and assets to Manila Wine Merchants, Inc., a Philippine corporation formed on May 27, 1937, (hereinafter referred to as the Manila Company), for the sum of P400,000 Philippine currency; that this sale was duly authorized by the stockholders of the Hongkong Company at a meeting held on July 22, 1937; that the contract of sale between the two companies was executed on the same date, a copy of the contract being attached hereto as Schedule ""A""; and that the final resolutions completing the said sale and transferring the business and assets of the Hongkong Company to the Manila Company were adopted on August 3, 1937, on which date the Manila Company were adopted on August 3, 1937, on which date the Manila Company paid the Hongkong company the P400,000 purchase price.


IV


That pursuant to a resolution by its Board of Directors purporting to declare a dividend, the Hongkong Company made a distribution from its earnings for the year 1937 to its stockholders, plaintiffs receiving the following:
