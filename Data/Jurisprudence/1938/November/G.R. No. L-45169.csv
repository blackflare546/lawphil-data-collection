Manila, P.I., February 1935.




The principal question to be determined, in view of the aforequoted statement of facts, is whether o not by virtue of the franchise granted to Charles M. Swift on January 30, 1906 by Act No. 1446 of the Philippine Commission, and transferred to the herein plaintiff and appelle, Manila Electric Company, the latter has a right to collect tolls from the herein defendant and appellant, Pasay Transportation Company, every time its cars pass over the bridge which said grantee has constructed across the Pasig River pursuant to the aforesaid franchise.


Section 1 and 11 of the aforesaid franchise Act No. 1446 provide as follows: 
lawphi1.net


Section 1. A franchise is hereby granted to Charles M. Swift to construct, maintain, and operate and electric railroad, either double or single track (with the exceptions hereinafter set forth), with the necessary sidings and turnouts, and to construct, maintain, and operate an electric light, heat, and power system along the line of said railroad and on all the streets and thoroughfares in the town of Pasig, which railroad shall begin at any point along Calle Real, Paco, Manila Road, thence along the San Pedro Macati Road to a point opposite what is known as the English cemetery, and thence in an easterly direction, by private right of way, o license, to be acquired by the grantee, to the town of Pasig, in the Province of Rizal, and to such point in said towns as may be agreed upon between the municipal authorities of Pasig and the grantee, and approved by the provincial board of the province, or, in case of failure to agree, then to such terminal point as may be determined upon by the Philippine Commission, crossing the Pasig river at or near the present Pasig ferry on a steel bridge to be constructed by the grantee in accordance with plans to be approved by the Director of Public Works; or on a private right of way the entire route, beginning at any point on the line of the road of the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company on Calle Real, Paco, between Calle Nozaleda and the San Pedro Macati road and running in an easterly direction, crossing the Pasig River at the point and in the manner above provided, or, at the election of the said grantee, on a private right of way the entire route, beginning at any point on the Malate line of the south of the bridge across the estero at Fort San Antonio de Abad, and running in an easterly direction, across the Pasig River at the point and in the manner above provided, with the privilege in any case of connecting the said road with the present line of the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company: 
Provided
, That the bridge across the Pasig River above authorized shall be so constructed as to permit of its use as a wagon and foot bridge by the general public, and the general public shall be entitled to use said bridge as though the same were a public bridge without the payment of any fee or toll for said use. The grantee shall construct the bridge complete for his use and for the use of the public as above provided and shall thereafter keep in good and safe repair that portion of the bridge between the outer rail and the side of the bridge, that portion between the rails, and that portion eighteen inches outside the inner rail. The remainder of the floor of the bridge shall be kept in repair by the municipality of Pasig.

SEC. 11. Whenever any franchise or right of way is granted to any other person or corporation, now or hereafter in existence, over portions of the lines and tracks of the grantee herein, the terms on which said other person or corporation shall use such right of way, and the compensation to be paid to the grantee herein by such other person or corporation for said use, shall be fixed by the member of the Supreme Court, sitting as a board of arbitrators, the decision of a majority of whom shall be final.




It is seen from the provisions of section 1 of the franchise Act No. 1446, above quoted, that Charles M. Swift was authorized as part of his franchise, to construct across the Pasig River, at or near the ferry then existing, a steel bridge, with plans to be approved by the Director of Public Works, in such a way that a portion thereof may be used by the public in general, as a wagon and foot bridge, as though the same were a public bridge without paying fees of kind, the grantee being chargeable with keeping in good and safe repair the part of the said bridge between the outer rail and the side of the bridge, that portion between the rail, and the municipality of Pasig shall keep in repair the remainder of the floor or the said bridge. Pursuant to section 11, also above quoted, the grantee may charge compensation when any privilege or right of way is grantee to any other person or corporation to make use of a pat of the lines or tracks of the grantee.


It is not contended that the Pasay Transportation Company had obtained any privilege or right of way to make use of a part of the lines or tracks of the plaintiff, nor that its trucks pass over said lines or tracks; consequently the latter cannot invoke its franchise to collect toll from the defendant for the said trucks which pass over the aforesaid bridge in the portion set apart for the public in general. The right to collect tolls from the public for passing over a public bridge exists only by virtue of law (9 Corpus Juris, page 447, sec. 33); so that the portion of the bridge here in question, set apart for the use of the general public, for wagons and travellers, who are not under the duty to pay fees of any kind, partakes of a public nature as provided by the franchise Act No. 1446 itself, which the plaintiff and appellee, Manila Electric Company, invokes, wherefore, it has no right to collect tolls from the defendant and appellant, Pasay Transportation Company, for the passage by its passenger trucks over the said portion set apart for public use and which the municipality of Pasig is under a duty to maintain in good shape and repair, inasmuch as, as we have said, its franchise does not authorize such collection.


For the foregoing considerations, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the possessors of a franchise granted by law, to construct a bridge as a part of its electric railway system, a portion of which is set apart for its own use and the other portion for the use of the general public, for wagons and travellers, free from the payment of fees of any kind, the grantee being charged with the conversation and repair of the first portion, and the municipality where the bridge is constructed being charge with the conservation and repair of the floor of the other portion, has no right collect any toll from a land transportation operator for the passage of its passenger trucks, unless it is authorized by its franchise to make such collection.


Wherefore, the appealed decision is reversed, and the defendant and appellant, Pasay Transportation Company, is absolved for the complaint, with the costs to the appellee. So ordered.
