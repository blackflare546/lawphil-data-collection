8. Case No. I.S. No. 13293 for Coercion, etc. on May 26 1958. Dropped by Asst. Fiscal Antonio A. Alindogan (City Fiscal, Mla., 9-30-60). 




The Court of First Instance found that the violation of the ordinances of the City of Manila and of the National Internal Revenue Code were not impediments to his naturalization because the said offenses do not involve moral turpitude. The Solicitor General contends before Us that the same do constitute offenses involving moral turpitude. But in addition, the Solicitor General contends that the petitioner cannot be considered as having an irreproachable character as required by the Naturalization Law. 


We disagree with the opinion of the court below that none of the offenses of which the petitioner was convicted involves moral turpitude. We hold that the use of a meter stick without the corresponding seal of the Internal Revenue Office, by one who has been engaged in business for a long time, involves moral turpitude because it involves a fraudulent use of a meter stick, not necessarily because the Government is cheated of the revenue involved in the sealing of the meter stick, but because it manifests an evil intent on the part of the petitioner to defraud customers purchasing from him in respect to the measurement of the goods purchased. 


But even assuming that the last conviction does not involve moral turpitude, at least the above convictions, together with the violation civil and criminal, which he had been complained of before the authorities, conclusively show that he has not conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his entire period of residence in the Philippines in his relation with the constituted government, as required in Sec. 2, par. 3 of the Revised Naturalization Act. (Com. Act No. 473.) 


In view of this finding it is unnecessary to consider the other assignments of error made by the Solicitor General in his brief. 


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and the petition of Ao Lin for naturalization dismissed with costs against petitioner-appellee. So ordered. 


Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala and Makalintal JJ., concur.
