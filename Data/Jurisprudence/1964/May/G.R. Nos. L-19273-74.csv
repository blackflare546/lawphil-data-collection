vs.


COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and TAGKAWAYAN LABOR UNION,
 respondents.


R E S O L U T I O N 


LABRADOR, 
J.:


In its motion for reconsideration, petitioner prays that (the order requiring) the reinstatement of the 113 laborers should not be ordered because of the impossibility of the reinstatement and the losses it will cause petitioner. Precisely the Court, taking into account the impossibility of reinstating the laborers by reason of the fact alleged in its motion for new trial, instead of ordering their reinstatement, decreed that they should be entitled to three months back pay. Petitioner therefore should have no ground for complaint. The losses suffered by reason of the grant of three months pay is the petitioner's penalty for dismissing the employees without just cause. 


WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner St. Cecilia Sawmills, Inc., is hereby denied.
