(f) That Lao Kee (
alias 
Lu Pong), Lee Cok Tan Hong, Tan Kian, Co Giac, Tan Hong Chian Hian, Tan Tak Tiao, Kick Chia and the Community Sawmill Company had used the road and bridge in question sometime before April 6, 1953, until the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction of June 25, 1953, manifest bad faith; 




2. Declaring: 




(a) That Resolution No. 186, series of 1953, marked Exh. C, is valid insofar as it repealed Resolution No. 222, series of 1953; marked Exh. ""A"", and Resolution No. 119, series of 1953, marked Exh. B; 


(b) That Resolution No. 186, series of 1953, marked Exh. C. insofar as it declared that the road and bridge in question, public is null and void the same being in violation of Sec. 2131 of the Revised Administrative Code;

(d) That the said defendant Lao Kee (

Resolution No. 222, adopted 4 December 1950, reads: 




Whereas, there is at present an unfinished provincial road in the barrio of Viga, of the municipality of Calapan, known as the Viga-Communal-Goob Road, the construction of which could not be undertaken by the province due to insufficiency of funds; 


Whereas, the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc., through its President, Mr. D. M. Gotauco, in a letter addressed to the Governor of this province has made representations to undertake the construction of said road under certain conditions; and 


Whereas, the province is willing to accede to the request of the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc. and to give it the sole right for its use, provided that after a period of twenty (20) years, said company shall donate to the province the road it had constructed, provided further that during the said period of 20 years other concerns dealing in logs and/or lumber may use the same road upon permission granted to them by the said Calapan Lumber Co., Inc.; and provided finally that said road is open to all non-logging concerns or individuals during the said period of 20 years. Now, therefore, be it 


RESOLVED, That the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro grants, as hereby is granting, the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc. to undertake the construction of the unfinished provincial road in the barrio of Viga, municipality of Calapan, known as the Viga-Communal-Goob Road, subject to the stipulations stated above; and 


RESOLVED FURTHER, That copies of this resolution be furnished the District Engineer and the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc., through its President, Mr. D. M. Gotauco, for their information.

Resolution No. 119, adopted 6 April 1953, reads: 




Whereas, under Resolution No. 222, series of 1950, the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro under the former administration, granted the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc. the right to undertake the construction of the unfinished Viga-Communal-Goob provincial road the sole right for its use, under the following conditions: 




(1) That after a period of twenty (20) years, said company shall donate to the province the road it had constructed; 


(2) That during the said period of 20 years other concerns dealing in logs and/or lumber may use the same road upon permission granted to them by the Calapan Lumber Co.; and 


(3) That said road is open to all non-logging concerns or individuals during the said period of 20 years. 




Whereas, according to the records of the Provincial Board the said resolution has not been amended or modified up to the present, and, therefore, the same is still in force and binding as per agreement stipulated therein; 


Whereas, this Board has received reliable information to the effect that another certain lumber company is attempting to use, or has actually used the same road, by allowing to pass thru it its heavy trucks and tractors without securing any permission from the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc., to the detriment and prejudice of the interests of the latter lumber company which shouldered the cost of its completion in accordance with the rights granted to it by the province; and 


Whereas, after a careful consideration of the matter this Board is of the opinion that the right of the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc. over the said road as stipulated in the condition set forth in the resolution must be upheld for obvious reasons; Now, therefore, be it 


RESOLVED by the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro to authorize, as it hereby authorizes, the Calapan Lumber Company, Inc., to prohibit the use of the Viga-Communal-Goob provincial road, from point Km. 12.38 up to Km. 15.88 of said road, by any other concern or company dealing in logs and/or lumber, without the permission or consent of the said Calapan Lumber Co., Inc. in accordance with one of the stipulations or conditions agreed upon in Resolution No. 222, series of 1950, of the Provincial Board; and 


RESOLVED, FURTHER, That the District Engineer and the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc. be furnished with copies of this resolution, for their information.

Resolution No. 186, adopted 19 June 1953, reads: 




REVOKING RESOLUTIONS NOS. 222, SERIES OF 1950, AND 119, SERIES OF 1953, OF THE PROVINCIAL BOARD, GRANTING THE CALAPAN LUMBER COMPANY THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS TO USE THE VIGA-COMMUNAL-GOOB PROVINCIAL ROAD FOR A PERIOD OF TWENTY (20) YEARS. 


Whereas, under Resolution No. 222, series of 1950, the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro, under the former provincial administration, granted the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc. an authority to undertake the construction of the unfinished Viga-Goob provincial road from Point Km. 12.38 to Km. 15.88, and the exclusive right for its use, under certain conditions; 


Whereas, on April 6, 1953, this Board passed another resolution (119) maintaining the right of the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc. over the said road under the conditions stipulated in the above-cited resolution No. 222, and forthwith authorized the said company to prohibit the use of the portion of said road constructed at its expense by any other concern or company dealing in logs or lumber without its permission; 


Whereas, in a 9th Indorsement dated May 11, 1953, the pertinent parts of which are quoted hereunder, the Honorable, the Executive Secretary to whom the case regarding this matter was appealed for decision, and upon the recommendation of the Director of Public Works and with the concurrence of the Undersecretary of Public Works and Communications, ruled that provincial roads are considered as properties for public use and the Provincial Board may not therefore grant the exclusive use thereof to any private individual or entity which would discriminate against or exclude the general public from a reasonable use thereof, and therefore, the resolution in question should be revoked. 




In this connection, it should be stated that Provincial roads are properties for public use and the provincial board may not grant the exclusive use thereof to any private individual or entitle or enter into a contract or agreement which would tend to discriminate against or exclude the general public from a reasonable use thereof. Resolutions Nos. 222, series of 1950, and 119, series of 1953, of the Provincial Board, granting the Calapan Lumber Company an exclusive right to use the said road for a period of twenty (20) year and to prohibit lumber or logging concerns from using the road in question without the company's permission, should therefore be revoked. In consonance with the policy of the law, and as correctly the suggested by the Director of Public Works and the Undersecretary of Public Works and Communications the portion of the Viga-Communal Road from Km. 12.38 to 15.89, having a length of 3.5 kilometers, should be declared a toll road in order to raise funds for its maintenance and with which to reimburse the Calapan Lumber Company for the expenses the latter had incurred in the construction of this portion of the road. 




Whereas, in view of the said ruling, this Board has been requested to take immediate action on the matter to declare the above-said portion of the Viga-Communal-Goob provincial road as a toll road; and, 


Whereas, according to an estimate made by the office of the District Engineer the Calapan Lumber Company has spent for the construction of the portion of the road in question having a length of 3.5 kilometers, the amount of P25,000.00 more or less; Now, therefore, be it — 


RESOLVED, That Resolutions Nos. 222, series of 1950, and 119, series of 1953, of the Provincial Board, which grant the Calapan Lumber Co., Inc., the exclusive right to use the Viga-Communal-Goob provincial road for a period of 20 years, under certain conditions, be, and hereby are, revoked; 


RESOLVED, FURTHER, That the portion of said Viga-Communal-Goob provincial road, from Point Km. 12.38 up to Km. 15.88 thereof, be and hereby is, declared PROVINCIAL TOLL ROAD, under the provisions of section 2131 of the Revised Administrative Code; 


RESOLVED, FURTHERMORE, That the following toll rates to be paid by any motor vehicle for the use of the provincial road be, and hereby are, fixed, effective today, June 19, 1953, the proceeds from which shall be used for the maintenance of the said road and the balance thereof for the reimbursement to the said company for the expenses it had incurred in the construction for said portion of the road: 




For every truck, one way P1.00 

For every weapon carrier, one way .60 

For every jeepney .30 




PROVIDED, however, that the portion of the road declared herein as provincial toll road shall continue to be so up to and until the amount spent by the Calapan Lumber Company for its construction shall have been covered by reimbursement to said company; and 


RESOLVED, FINALLY, That copies of this resolution be forwarded to His Excellency, the President of the Philippines, thru the Director of Public Works and the Honorable, the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, Manila.

Resolution No. 169, adopted 21 April 1956, revoked Resolution No. 186 in so far as it declared Provincial Toll Road that part of the road invoked in this case. 


There seems to be no doubt that Resolutions Nos. 222 and 119, adopted by the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro quoted above, mere 
ultra vires
, because sections 2067 (f) and (g) on powers of the provinces as political bodies corporate; 2102 (g) on powers of the provincial boards; 2106 (f) on powers of the provincial boards to be exercised with the approval of the Department Head; and 2113 (a) on road and bridge fund, of the Revised Administrative Code, do not authorize the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro to pass and adopt said resolutions. The contention that the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro under section 2106 (g) invoked by the appellee is authorized to pass those resolutions Nos. 222 and 199 quoted above, is untenable because said paragraph of the section authorizes the Provincial Board ""to permit, upon favorable recommendation by the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, and subject to such conditions as may properly protect the public interests, the construction and maintenance, for private use of railways, conduits, and telephone lines across public thoroughfares, streets, roads, or other public property and in the province: 
Provided
, That such construction and private use shall not prevent or obstruct the public use of such thoroughfares, streets, roads or other public property and that the permit granted shall at all times be subject to revocation by the Secretary of the Interior, if, in the judgment of that official, the public interest requires it."" Consequently, Resolution No. 186 revoking the two previous resolutions was in order. 


The road known as the Viga-Communal-Goob connecting two finished or completed parts of the provincial road, from kilometer 12.38 to 15.88, as laid out by the personnel of the office of the District Engineer was planned or intended to be laid out and constructed by the Provincial Government of Oriental Mindoro to complete said road. The fact that the survey, lay-out and actual construction of the unfinished part of the road were done at the appellee's expense, does not convert said road after construction into a private road, for it does not appear that the parts of the land where the road was laid out and constructed belong to or are owned by the appellee. The evidence shows that the owners of such parts of land ceded their parts of the land owned by them without any consideration because of their desire to have the road completed or to connect the ends of two completed parts of the road. It may be conceded that the appellee built the road in question in good faith; and such being the case, it may be argued that the appellee is entitled to keep or have possession of the road until after it shall have been reimbursed of the expenses it had incurred in constructing and maintaining the road in good condition. The provisions of the Civil Code on the right of a builder in good faith on a private land
1
 cannot be invoked and applied to the road in question, because public interest is involved and the people living in that part of the province are entitled to use the road.


It is true that that part of the Resolution No. 186 above quoted converting the road in question into toll road contravenes section 2131 of the Revised Administrative Code, because in the case of road the recommendation of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications and the authorization of the president of the Philippines had to be secured and such recommendation and authorization had not been obtained. 


Upon the foregoing considerations, this Court is of the opinion, and so holds, that the road involved in this case cannot be declared private property, and for that reason the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro may elect between paying the appellee the total cost of the construction of the road together with lawful interest from the date of actual disbursement by the appellee to the date of payment by the Province of Oriental Mindoro within a reasonable period not to exceed one year from the date this judgment shall become final; or upon securing the recommendation of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications and authorization of the President of the Philippines to designate such road an toll road, to raise the necessary fund to reimburse the appellee of the total cost of construction of the road, together with lawful interest from the date of actual disbursement by the appellee to the date of payment by the Province of Oriental Mindoro, and the latter is ordered to refund the amount paid for tolls by, the appellee during the enforcement of Resolution No. 186 which, as above stated, was unauthorized. The judgment appealed from making final the preliminary writ of injunction and ordering the appellants to pay the appellee the sum of P10,000 as attorney's fees, are reversed and set aside. The rest of the judgment appealed from not inconsistent with this opinion is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.
