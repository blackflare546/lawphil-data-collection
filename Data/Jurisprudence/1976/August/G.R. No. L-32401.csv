Â 


AQUINO, 
J.:
Husing Lao in this certiorari and mandamus case seeks the annulment of the ruling of Judge Felino D. Abalos at the hearing of Administrative Case No. 69-MJ, 
""Husing Lao vs. Municipal Judge Esteban T. Bumanglag of Pangutaran, Sulu""
, which ruling is that the chief of police, over respondent Judge Bumanglag's objection, cannot testify on the police blotters which were produced at the hearing not by the custodian thereof but by the chief of police himself and which were not shown to be official records. 


The respondents answered the petition. The case was submitted for decision on January 11, 1971. 


The resignation of Judge Bumanglag was accepted by the President of the Philippines on November 24, 1972, or before the administrative investigation could be terminated. The said administrative case was dismissed for having become moot (Resolution dated June 29, 1976). 


Counsel for petitioner Lao in his manifestation of August 2, 1976 said that the issue in this case had also become moot. 


WHEREFORE, this case is dismissed for having become moot and academic. No costs. 


SO ORDERED. 


Fernando, C.J., Barredo, Antonio and Concepcion, Jr., JJ., concur.
