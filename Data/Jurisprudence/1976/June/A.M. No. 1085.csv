SECOND DIVISION 




A.M. No. 1085	June 10, 1976


DALTON WOODROW WORTHINGTON, 
complainant,

vs.


FELIPE
 
FERNANDEZ, 
respondent.
 


R E S O L U T I O N 


Â 


AQUINO, 
J.:
Dalton Woodrow Worthington lodged in 1972 a complaint for disbarment charging Atty. Felipe Fernandez with malpractice, fraud and deceit in
 
connection with an estafa case filed in 1968 against Worthington in the office of the City
 
Fiscal of Manila. 


The subject matter of the estafa case was the blending tobacco imported
 
by the Eastern Tobacco Trading Corporation (of which Worthington was the president).
 
The tobacco was seized by the Bureau of Customs. The estafa case was dismissed due to
 
the efforts of Fernandez. 


Worthington alleged that on December 28, 1968 he and Fernandez entered into a
 
contract whereby it was agreed that Eastern Tobacco Trading Corporation would pay
 
Fernandez as attorney's fees twenty percent of the proceeds of the sale of the blending
 
tobacco. 


Worthington averred that the contract was simulated because its real purpose was
 
to secure to himself a share in the proceeds of the sale of the seized tobacco. He denounced
 
certain irregularities committed by Fernandez in connection with the release and
 
disposition of the blending tobacco. 


Fernandez denied the charges. He insinuated that it was Worthington who failed to
 
live up to his commitment to pay him his attorney's fees. He filed a counterclaim for
 
damages in the sum of P300,000. 


The case was referred to the Solicitor General for investigation, report and
 
recommendation. 


Due to interminable postponements the case was never heard. Thus, at the
 
instance of Worthington, the hearings set for August 15, September 15 and 27 and
 
December 21, 1972 were postponed. The parties agreed to cancel the hearings set for
 
December 4 and 5, 1972 and January 4, February 8 and March 8, 1973. Due to
 
Worthington's non-appearance, the hearings scheduled on April 13 and 16 and July
 
19, 1973 were not held. 


On May 8, 1973 respondent Fernandez filed in the Office of the Solicitor General a
 
motion to dismiss the case because of Worthington's failure to prosecute it. The Acting
 
Solicitor General in his report dated April 20, 1976 recommends that the case be
 
dismissed. 


Inasmuch as complainant Worthington had apparently lost interest in the case and as
 
there is no justification for proceeding further against the respondent, this case, including
 
the counterclaim, which cannot be ventilated in a disbarment proceeding, is dismissed. 


SO ORDERED. 


Fernando (Chairman), Barredo, Antonio and Martin, JJ., concur. 


Concepcion, Jr., J. is on leave.
