FIRST DIVISION




G.R. No. L-20343	September  29, 1976


COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, 
petitioner

vs.


CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY, 
respondent.
 


Solicitor General Arturo A. Alafriz, Solicitor Alejandro B. Afurong and Special Attorney Balbino Gatdula, Jr. for petitioner.


A.S. Monzon, B.v. Abela & J.M. Castillo for respondent.




MAKASIAR, 
J:
Appeal taken by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue from the August 15, 1962 decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in its CTA Case No. 587 holding that respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company is not embraced in the term
 commercial broker 
or 
commission merchant 
set out in Section 194 (t) of the National Internal Revenue Code, and hence not liable to pay the fixed and percentage taxes imposed on commercial brokers under Sections 182 (A, 3-S) and 195, respectively, of the tax code, and the imposition by the petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue on respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company of the 25% and 50% surcharges as devoid of legal basis; and that the Commissioner's method of computation of Cadwallader's sales tax as manufacturer of venetian blinds is erroneous, thus reducing its sales tax liability for 1952 from P6,701.59 to only P255.64. 


Petitioner on May 24, 1955 assessed and demanded payment from respondent the aggregate amount of P37,830.94 representing allegedly its fixed and percentage taxes as a commercial broker, deficiency manufacturer's sales taxes and deficiency sales taxes from July 1, 1949 to December 31, 1954 (pp. 24-25, Vol. 111, rec.). 


Upon protest of respondent of the May 24, 1955 assessment, the petitioner on August 22, 1957 reduced the same to P23.492.84 (pp. 66-71, Vol. 111, rec.). But instead of reducing the amount of the last assessment of August 22, 1957, the petitioner on September 9, 1958 increased it to P25,551.96 (pp. 142-124, Vol. 111. rec.).


Branding the September 9, 1958 assessment of P25,551.96 as devoid of legal basis, respondent went on October 2, 1958 to the Court of Tax Appeals, whose decision, as aforementioned, is now under review. 


The undisputed facts are: 
ñé+.£ªwph!1






Petitioner Cadwallader Pacific Company (Cadwallader for brevity), is a domestic corporation (Par. 1, Petition for Review, CTA rec. p.1). the primary purpose of which, as embodied in its articles of incorporation, is 






To buy, manufacture. produce, or otherwise sell, import, export. trail and deal in general merchandise, goods, wares, food products and commodities of every kind and description' (BIR rec. p. 54).
ñé+.£ªwph!1






And incudental to its primary purpose, it is empowered among others: 


(3) To act as financial, commercial, general agent or factor of. or to undertake management of any person, partnership, coroporation or association carrying on any transaction or negotiation or any business of manufacturing or dealing in all kinds of goods, wares, merchandise, food products and commodities of every kind and description and, while acting as such agent, factor or manager to perform such acts, enter into such obligation and carry on such transactions as shall tend to promotethe interests that the corporation shall represent. 


(4) To make and enter into all kinds of contracts, agreements and obligations by or with any person or persons, corporation or corporations, for the purchasing, acquiring, holding, manufacturing and selling or otherwise disposing of all kinds of general merchandise, goods, wares, food products and commodities of every kind and description, either as principal or agent, upon commission or otherwise' (BIR rec. pp. 53-54).


It has a branch office (Branch Office for brevity) in Arcadia California, United States of America which serves as its buying office (Exhibits Y & 6, BIR rec. p. 31).


During the period from July 1, 1949 to December 31, 1954 (see Exh. 5, BIR rec. p. 19), Cadwallader secured from its local customers orders for the purchase by the latter of merchandise. Pursuant to the arrangements agreed upon, an irrevocable letter of credit payable to the Branch Office was drawn by the buyer who placed the order. A copy of the contract, together with the irrevocable leter of credit was sent to the Branch Office which bought the merchandise and shipped them directly to the local customer in the Philippines on its (Branch Office) invoice (Exh. Y & 6, BIR rec. p. 31; see tsn p. 11). the corresponding bill of lading and other shipping documents and drafts drawn in favor of the Branch Office were forwarded to the bank which issued the letter of credit for acceptance and payment.


For a better appreciation of the nature of the transactions between Cadwallader and the local buyers, we reproduce hereunder the provisions of a sample contract (Exh. X, BIR rec. p. 13):

In the event that buyer fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the foregoing within ten (10) days from receipt of such confirmation, buyer will be liable for all and whatever kind of expenses and damages incurred in connection with this order.


Profits derived from the transactions were accounted for in Cadwallader's profit and loss statement as 'commission earned'. Although one-half of the profits were credited in favor of Cadwallader and one-half in favor of the Branch Office, the whole was declared as income in the former's Philippine income tax returns (Exh. 1, BIR rec., p. 62). 


For the periods from July 1, 1949 to September 21, 1950 and from September 22, 1950 to December 31, 1954, Cadwallader realized profits on said transactions in the amounts of P36,622.22 and P141,503.70, respectively, or a total of P178,125,92 on which respondent broker's percentage and fixed taxes, inclusive of surcharges, in the amount of P18,010.37 (Exh. 4, BIR rec., pp. 38- 39)."" [Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, pp. 10-14, Vol I, rec.; p. 4, Vol. II rec.; pp. 13-15, Vol. IIIl, rec.) 


1. Petitioner is correct in his contention that respondent acted as a commercial broker in effecting the transactions involved in this present appeal. Paragraph 14 of the contract used and prepared by respondent is but too clear on this point. It clearly defines its participation in effecting the said transactions as that of a commercial broker, thus: 


14. It 
is understood and agreed upon that insofar as Cadwallader Pacific Company isconcerned, its intervention is limited to a mere broker in effecting this transaction and that no responsibility whatsoever attaches to it. It is also understood and agreed further, that in the event thereis violation of the conditions given hereof, BUYER recognizes the said CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY as the  SELLERS and/or SHIPPER'S representative authorized and empowered to bring suit in the name of the SELLER and/or SHIPPER or its own name CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY alone without joining the SELLER and/or SHIPPER, in which case the personality of the CADWALLADER PACIFIC shall not be questioned in court by the BUYER or by its agents and/or representatives"" (italics supplied).






Aforesaid paragraph speaks of three parties, 
contrary to the claims of the respondent
. It makes mention of 
buyer, seller and/or shipper and Cadwallader Pacific Company in the capacity of a broker and as seller's and/or shipper's representative
. By the very wording of the said paragraph, seller is a different entity from Dadwallader Pacific Company, but said company also acts as the seller's and/or shipper's representatitve for certain specified purposes. As admitted by repondent, ""[A]n indent transaction requires three parties to the transaction, namely, the customer or buyer, the commercial broker or indentor, and the supplier who is usually a non-resident manufacturer residing in the country where the merchandise is to be bought"" (p. 42, Vol. II, rec.; pp. 18-19, 22, Respondent's Brief, Vol. I, rec.). By the very terms of paragraph 14. Cadwallader Pacific Company acts not only for its local customers but likewise for the undisclosed seller or manufacturer. Thus, in case of violations of the conditions of the contract, ""... BUYER recognizes the said CADWALL ADER PACIFIC COMPANY as the SELLER'S and/or SHIPPER'S representative authorized and empowered to bring suit in the name of the SELLER and/or SHIPPER, in which case the personality of the CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY shall not be questioned in court by the BUYER or by its agents and/or representatives."" It cannot therefore now be successfully claimed by respondent that it is itself in the contract in paragraph 14 thereof, as the representative of the seller and/or shipper. Simple common sense should have deterred respondent from making this contention for one cannot represent itesle in a representative capacity. The main office in the Philippines acts for its local customers while the branch office in the United States acts for and deals with the seller or manufacturer. Because the main and the branch offices are one and the same Cadwallader Pacific Company, the clear conclusion is that it acts for both the buyer and the seller. The general pattern of conduct of the respondent in these transactions as contained in the agent's report (Exh. 5, pp. 22-16, BIR rec., Vol. III, rec.) very well confirms this proposition. 


Thus:
ñé+.£ªwph!1






Respondent's Manila office secured prospective buyers in the Philippines. Once a prospective buyer was secured, the respondent and the buyer entered into an indent order contract a sample of which is found on page 15 of the BIR records. A copy of the indent contract was forwarded to California U.S.A., together with an irrevocable letter of credit drawn in a local branch by the buyer in favor of contracts, the California office. Upon receipt of the indent order contracts, the California office canvassed the U.S. market to fill up the orders contained therein as neither the respondent nor its California office invoiced them in the name of the buyer and shipped them direct to the latter, accompanied by the usual bill of lading and other shipping documents and by drafts drawn against the buyers in favor of respondent's California office, such drafts being forwarded to the local bank or banks that issued the irrevocable letters of credit for presentation, acceptance and payment by the local buyers"" (pp. 5-6 of Petitioner's Brief. p. 49, Vol. I, rec.).






By statutory definition, ""(t) Commercial broker includes all persons other than importers, manufacturers, producers or 
bonafide employees, 
who, for compensation or profit, sell or bring about sales or purchases of merchandise for other persons, of bring proposed buyers and sellers together or negotitate freights or other means of transportation, or for the shippers, or consignors or consignees of freight by vessels or other means of transportation. The term includes commission merchants."" 


By judicial interpretation, it was held that:
ñé+.£ªwph!1






A commission merchant is one engaged in the purchase or sale for another of personal party which, for this purpose, is place in his posession and at his disposal. He maintains a relation not only with his principal and the purchasers or vendors, but also with the priority which is the subject matter of the ... 


... The broker. unlike the commission merchant, has no relation with the thing he sells or buys. He merely an intermediary between the purchaser and the vendor. He acquires neither the possession nor the custody of the things sold. His only office is to bring together the parties to the transaction. ... (Pacific Commercial Co. vs. Yatco, 68 Phil. 398).


... A broker is generally defined as one who is engaged, for others, on a commission, negotiating contracts relative to property with the custody of which he has no concern; the negotiator between other parties, never acting in his own name, but in the name of those who employed him; he is strictly a middleman and for some purposes, the agent of both parties"" (Behn Meyer & Co., Ltd. vs. Nolting and Garcia, Phil. 274). 


The chief feature which distinguishes a broker from other classes of agents is that it is the intermediary or middleman and, in effecting a sale or exchange of property, acts in a certain sense as the agent of both parties to the transaction.
 Another distinction is that the Idea of exclusiveness enters into an employment agency, while in respect of a broker there is a holding out of oneself generally for employment in matter of trade, commerce and navigation 
and on this principle, a broker is distinguished from a clerk (12 C.J.S. pp. 8-9, citing cases, italics supplied)"" [Kuenzle & Streifff, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 12 SCRA 300; Collector of Internal Revenue vs. Tan Eng Hong, 18 SCRA 431].






By its own stipulation, respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company had correctly described its participation in the transactions covered by the indent contract, which it, itself, prepared as that of a broker. Hence, it cannot now avoid the legal effects o f that admission by repudiating the same on the pretext that its actual conduct of the transactions is otherwise. For, as already stated the aforesaid paragraph 14 of the indent contract, which deals specifically with the nature of respondent's participation in the contract, not only expressly stated - respondent's participation as that of a broker; but likewise gave the features of one acting as a broker. Thus ""xxx its interrention is limited to a mere broker in effecting the transaction and no responsiblity whatsoever attaches to it. xxx. [I]n the event there is violation of the conditions given hereof, BUYER recognizes the said CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY as the SELLERS and/or SHIPPER'S representative authorized and empowered to bring sit in the name of the SELLER and/or SHIPPER or its own name CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY alone without joining the SELLER and/or SHIPPER, in which case the personality of the CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY shall not be questioned in court by the BUYER or by its agents and/or representatives."" Furthermore, on the very face of the contract, respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company signed, not as a seller, but as an indentor (Exh. X, pp. 13-15, Vol. 111, rec.). 


It is thus our considered view that Cadwallader Pacific Company, in effecting the transactions, subject matter of the present case, acted within the statutory definitions of a commercial broker, which expressly includes that of a commission merchant. 


2.	Respondent Court of Tax Appeals therefore erred in making an interpretation contrary to the express and clear provisions of the indent contracts used by respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company in the transactions subject of the present case. The contract was clear as to Cadwallader's participation and hence, there was no need to make any interpretation. Even assuming that indeed there was doubt brought about by the other stipulations of the contract, that doubt should be resolved against respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company, because, firstly, paragraph 14 of the indent contract should govern since said paragraph alone specifically deals with the nature of respondent's participation in effecting the transactions covered by the said indent contract, the very main issue of the case, and as already stated, respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company not only described its participation therein as a mere broker but also signed in the contract as an indentor; and secondly, the contract having been prepared by respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company, all doubts arising therefrom must be resolved against it. 


3.	Respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company contends that respondent Court of Tax Appeals was right in holding as authoritaties its precious decision in Cadwallader Pacific Company vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CTA Case No. 536, Dec. 23,1960) which this COURT affirmed in 1966 (G.R. No. L-18297,18 SCRA 827-834).


But the rationale of the aforesaid decision cannot apply in the present case for various reasons: 


a. While it is true that the contracts used and prepared by respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company in the transactions involved in the qqqpr previous and second Cadwallader cases are almost Identical in terms and stipulations, there is no denying the fact that paragraph 14 of the contract involved in this second Cadwallader case is substantially different from that of the contract in the previous Cadwallader case. Parenthetically, it must qqqb stated that the previous Cadwallader case covers the taxable years 
1955 to 1957 
while this second case, now before US on appeal, covers earlier taxable years . 


Paragraph 14 of the contract used by respondent Cadwallader during the taxable years 
1955 to 1957 
which was the subject of the previous Cadwallader case provides as follows :
ñé+.£ªwph!1






14 — It is understood and agreed that in the event there is violation of the conditions given herefo, BUYER recognizes the said CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY, Manila, as the SELLER'S representative authorized and empowered to bring suit in the name of the seller who is the the CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY alone, in which case the personality of the CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY shall not be questioned in court by the BUYER or by its agents and/or represesentatives (p. 23 of Petitioner's Brief).






On the other hand, the original contract prepared by respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company which was used by it during the taxable years 
1949 to 1954
. subject of this present (second) case on appeal, provides: 
ñé+.£ªwph!1






14. — It is understood and agreed upon that insofar as Cadwallader Pacific Company is concerned, its intervention is limited to a mere broker in effecting this transaction and that no responsibility whatsoever attaches to it. It is also understood and agreed further, that in the event there is violation of the conditions given hereof, BUYER recocgnizes the said CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY as the SELLER'S and/or SHIPPER, in which case the personality of the CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY shall not be questioned in court by the BUYER or by its agents and/or representatives.






A reading of the two provisions readily shows the glaring variance in their terms and conditions. While the original text of paragraph 14 of the contract, which was the one used in this present second case, expressly defines respondent's liability as that of a broker, the subsequent contract, which was the one used in the previous Cadwallader case, omits the said definition or admission. Herein petitioner had reason to insinuate that, ""... respondent, in order to escape liability for broker's fixed and percentage tax, deleted from its later contracts the statement to the effect that the intervention in the transactions involved in said contracts is that of a mere broker"" (p. 24 of Petitioner's Brief). Indeed, respondent Cadwallader was not held liable for said broker's fixed and percentage taxes for the year 1955 to 1957 by virtue of OUR affirmance of the decision of Court of Tax Appeals in the previous Cadwallader case. But in this present appeal. WE can no longer allow respondent to escape from said taxes by reason of the explicit stipulation of paragraph 14 used by respondent in the transactions covered by this case to the effect that it is a broker, which express stipulation is not found in the contract involved in the previous Cadwallader case for the reason that it was subsequently deleted from the contract used by respondent Cadwallader in its subsequent transactions, which were the subject matter of the prior Cadwallader case. 


b. 	The original contract under its crucial paragraph 14 named or mentioned three (3) parties: the seller and/or shipper; the buyer; and Cadwallader Pacific Company as broker and its representative of the seller and/or shipper; while the  later contract involved in the previous Cadwallader case named only two parties and expressly named Cadwallader Pacific Company as the seller, thus removing one of the very features of a broker/agency transaction which was present in the original contract.


4.	Consequently, respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company is liable to pay the broker's fixed and percentage taxes and surcharges, in the total amount of P18,018.37. 


Respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company is liable for the 25%, and 50% surcharges: 25% surcharge for late payment of percentage tax in accordance with section 183 of the Tax Code; and 50% surcharges: 25% surcharge for late payment of percentage tax in accordance with section 183 of the tax Code; and 50% surcharge for having willfully neglected to file the returns for broker's tax purposes within the time prescribed by said section 183 of the Tax Code. Its failure is willful for the reason that while it was well aware of the fact that it is a broker as it itself expressly stipulated in its indent contract, which it drated it failed to file the necessary tax returns for brokers. 


II


Petitioner disputes the correctness of respondent's computation of its liability for manufacturer's percentage tax. It appease. from the records that: ""(D)uring the years 1952, 1953 and 1954, Cadwallader engaged in the manufacture of venetian blinds-making there from gross sales in respective sums of P245,345.50, P215,867.24 and P226,136.32. Believing itself taxable as a contractor, it paid the corresponding contractor's, it paid the corresponding contractor tax. Subsequently, respondent assessed it for manufacturer's sales tax under section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code, which, after deducting the amounts paid as contractor's tax, amounted to P6,701.69 (Annex 'A' of Petition for Review). Cadwallader admits liability for percentage tax on the sales of venetian blinds it manufactured, but questions the computation of the tax appearing in the assessment (see Memorandum for Petitioner, CTA rec. p. 51)"" [Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, p. 14, Vol 1, rec.]


The parties are one Chat respondent is liable as a manufacturer under section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code. They are at odds however on the correct amount of deductible raw materials used in the manufacture of venetian blinds. In resolving the conflicting claims of the parties on this point, the Court of Tax Appeals stated: 
ñé+.£ªwph!1






Cadwallader also assails the deficiency assessment for manufacturer's sales tax, It is urged that the 25% mark-up and expenses, consisting of bank charges, marine insurance and brokerage fees, should be added to the cost of raw materials used during the year involved. But respondent argues that these items have already been included in the inventory of cost of raw materials. 


The contention of respondent that the inventory cost already includes the 25% mark-up, bank charges, marine insurance, and brokerage fees is incorrect because their costt, as appearing in the records, represents only the cost, C & F, and licenses and fees and taxes paid. 


Having sustained the proposition that the mark-up and expense are not yet included in the inventory costs of raw materials and the same should, therefore, be added thereto, it follows that respondent's method of computing Cadwallader's liability for sales tax on the manufactured venetian blinds is erroneous. Consequently, we find Cadwallader's method, as illustrated in the memorandum submitted in support of its answer to the petition for review, proper and correct. 


However, we find that Cadwallader, in its computation of its liability for sales tax on the manufacture of. venetian blinds, represented the total amount of purchase of raw material imported in 1952 as P46,321.68. From Exhibit I, we gather that the total amount of purchases should be P46,421.68 (the sum of the dollar value, C & F Manila, and license fee and sales tax), which we hold to be correct In view of this inadvertent error, we find Cadwallader liable for the payment of deficiency manufacturer's sales tax amounting to P204.51 plus a surcharge of 257, for late payment. However, for the years 1953 and 1954, it is not liable for deficiency sales tax. 


Similarly, we find that mechanical errors have been committed in Cadwallader's proferred computation of the sales tax on venetian blinds manufactured in 1953 and 1954. Thus, instead of P7,710.74 as the total amount of tax already paid for 1953, the correct amount is P7,110.74 (see Exh. Y-1, BIR qqqree p. 73). And instead of the sums of P581.53 and PI,932.11 spent for marine insurance and brokerage fees in 1954, the correct figures are P572.18 and PI,882.05, respectively (see Exhibit qqqS No. 5, Petitioner's Folders). These errors do not alter the fact that Cadwallader does not owe deficiency sales tax on venetian blinds manufactured in 1953 and 1954. On the contrary, there is an overpayment, the refund or credit of which is not sought in this proceeding. 


We find Cadwallader's objection to the employment of the ratio method in determining the cost of deductible raw materials used in method in qqqte ni g 1954 meritorious. Cadwallader has presented in evidence invoices, vouchers and importer's declarations upon which the cost of raw materials may be ascertained. 


Cadwallader did not contest its liability for the payment of advance sales tax in the amount of P480.00 for the period from February 16, 1951 to December 31, 1953 pp. 16-17, Vol. 1, rec.). 






The foregoing pronouncements of the Court of Tax Appeals are factual and the settled rule is that such factual findings can only be disturbed on appeal if not supported by substantial evidence (Surigao Consolidated Mining Co., Inc. vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, 9 SCRA 733 [1963]. Petitioner failed to show in his brief that the foregoing factual findings of the Court of Tax Appeals are unsupported by substantial evidence. On the other hand, WE find, after going over the voluminous records of the case (Exhibits F, G, H, H-A, H-1 to H-10-a and 1, Vol. IV, rec.; Exhibits J, J-1 to J-10, Vol. V, rec.; Exhibits K, M, N, N-1 to N-20, Vol. VI, rec.; Exhibits 0, 0- 1 to 0-54, Vol. VII, rec.; Exhibits P, P-1, Q, R, R-1, to R-46, S, T, T-1 to T-57, U, V, V-1 to V-13 and W, Vol. VIII, rec.) that the findings of the Court of Tax Appeals are amply supported by the evidence. The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals (pp. 17-18, Vol I, rec.) as well as the brief (pp. 29-35 thereof, p. 55, Vol. I, rec.) of respondent pointed to the evidence on records substantially supporting the aforequoted findings of fact.
