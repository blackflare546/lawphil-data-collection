NATIVIDAD VDA. DE IGNACIO, 
petitioner,

vs.


HON. DELFIN VIR. SUÑGA, in his capacity as Judge,  CFI of Camarines Sur, Branch I, and SIXTO TAN, 
respondents.
 


Jose T.  Surtida for petitioner.


Luis General, Jr. for respondent. 




AQUINO, 
J.:
Natividad Vda. de Ignacio in these special civil actions of 
certiorari,
 mandamus and prohibition seeks to annul the order of the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, Naga City Branch I, setting aside the decision of the City Court of Naga in Civil Case No. 3092 (an ejectment suit) and allowing Sixto Tan to present his evidence in conformity with his answer (Civil Case No. 7580). The facts are as follows: 


On October 1, 1955 Mrs. Ignacio, in her personal capacity and as administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband Jose Ignacio, leased to Sixto Tan ""for a period of fifteen (15) years"" a portion of Lot No. 1367 located in Naga City. The said lot, evidently a conjugal lot, has an area of five hundred ninety-five square meters. The portion leased to Tan has an area of one  hundred eighty-one square meters. It has a frontage of twenty six meters on Elias Angeles Street. 


It was stipulated in the lease contract that Tan was to construct a one story building on the leased lot. After the expiration of two years from the time the building was ready for occupancy, it would automatically become the lessors' property. Tan would then pay a monthly rental of P300 for the lease of the building. During the two-year period he would not pay any rental. 


The lease contract has the peculiarity that while it is stipulated therein that the term thereof is fifteen years (par. 2), without specifying when that period would commence, the contract also contains provisions stating that the lease is for twenty five years (pars. 3, 7 and 8). 


The explanation for such  dichotomy in the term of the lease is that after the expiration of the fifteen-year period the lease would continue, at a monthly rental of P150, with respect to ""the last two doors of' the building near the corner of Angeles and  Evangelista Streets. The two doors would ""serve as rights of way"" to Tan's other building constructed on the adjacent lot belonging to the heirs of Mariano Abella. The easement of right of way as well as the easement of light and view would exist for twenty-five years (pars. 7 and 8). 


It was further stipulated in the lease contract that in case of the destruction of the- building constructed by Tan, he would have the option to construct another building under the same terms and conditions for the remaining period of the lease. Should he not exercise that option, then the lease would be deemed rescinded except with respect to the right of way and Tan's right to open windows in the third story of his other building, which rights would endure up to the end of the twenty five year period. For reference, the contract is quoted below:

(SGD) RICARDO IGNACIO 		(SGD) NATIVIDAD MATEO 			Lessor					VDA. DE IGNACIO 							In her personal capacity and 							in her capacity as judicial 								administratrix in Special 								Proceeding No. 575 									Lessor 


			(SGD) SIXTO TAN  								      Lessee 


(Witnesses and notarial acknowledgment are omitted) 






A cursory perusal of the contract shows that it is vitiated by some ambiguities. The date when the fifteen-year period would commence is not crystal clear. That ambiguity affects the twenty-five year period. The provision that in the event the building is destroyed, the  lessee may construct another building under the same terms and conditions 'as in this contract"" is not clear as to whether the  lessee would not pay rentals within the two-year period counted from the date when the new  building is ready for occupancy. 


It is evident that during the  first two years of the fifteen years the lease is a gratuitous lease of the lot (as in commodatum) and that during the thirteen-year period the lease refers to the building which by then had become 
ipso facto 
the lessor's property. Thereafter, or during the ten-year period the lease is limited to the last two doors or to the lessors' obligation to recognize the easements of right of way and light and view in favor of Tan's building on the adjacent lot.


Tan constructed the building. It was finished ""sometime in 1956"" (pp. 58 and 68, Rollo). However, on November 7 or 8, 1968 it was completely burned. On November 23 Tan informed Mrs. Ignacio that he was going to reconstruct the building. They could not agree on the conditions under which the building was to be reconstructed. Mrs. Ignacio insisted that Tan should construct the building as stipulated in the 1955 lease contract. Than proposed that Mrs. Ignacio should shoulder the cost of reconstruction in excess of P6,000, the amount fixed in the lease contract. Mts. Ignacio rejected that proposal.


As Tan persisted in his determination to reconstruct the building at a cost of about P14,000 to P15,000, Mrs. Ignacio filed in the lower court an injunction action to restrain Tan from reconstructing the building. Executive Judge Ulpiano Sarmiento issued a restraining order. The case was assigned to Judge Delfin Vir. Suñga. On January 21, 1970 he issued an order dissolving the restraining order and denying the petition for injunction (Civil Case No. 6868).


Mrs. Ignacio assailed Judge Suñga's order by certiorari in the Court of Appeals. That Court on February 11, 1970 issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining Tan from reconstructing the building.


The Court of Appeals in its decision held that because Tan's lease expired on October 1, 1970, he had no more right to stay in the leased premises and he had virtually become a squatter therein. consequently, the injunction suit and the certiorari case had become moot and academic.


The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition without prejudice to Mrs. Ignacio's right to eject Tan should he refuse to vacate the leased premises. The Court found Tan in contempt of court for continuing with the reconstruction of the building in defiance of the injunction. It fined him five hundred pesos (Vda. de Ignacio vs. Judge Suñga, CA-G.R. No. 44657-R, October 28, 1970).


Tan in his motion for reconsideration assailed the Court's finding that the lease had already expired. He contended that the fifteen-year term of the lease did not commence on October 1, 1955 when the contract was executed; that it was stipulated that the rentals would be paid after the expiration of two years from the date the building was ready for occupancy; that even after the expiration of the fifteen-year period, Tan could still occupy for ten years the last two doors, and that, in case of reconstruction of the building, he could occupy it for two years without paying any rental, as stipulated in the lease contract. 


The Court of Appeals denied Tan's motion for reconsideration. It noted that its conclusion on the expiration of the lease was  based on the contract itself which formed part of the record. At the same time the Court observed that Tan's contentions regarding the term of the lease raised factual issues which could not be resolved at that stage of the case and which should be interposed as defenses in the trial court in the proper case at the proper time. That ambivalent observation spawned this controversy between Tan  and Mrs. Ignacio. 


Tan filed in this Court a petition for  certiorari praying for the reversal of the holding of the Court of Appeals that the lease had already expired and that he had committed contempt of court. This Court in a minute resolution denied the petition for lack of merit and because it involved factual matters (Tan vs.  Vda de Ignacio, L-33170, February 18, 1971). 


On November 20, 1970 Mrs. Ignacio filed in the City Court of Naga an unlawful detainer action against Tan and his sublessee on the basis of the Court of Appeals' finding that Tan's lease expired on October 1, 1970, She alleged that the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the premises occupied by Tan was two thousand five hundred pesos a month. 


She further alleged that  the building reconstructed by Tan was destroyed on October 13, 1970 by the typhoon 
Sening
 and that the Court of Appeals denied Tan's motion for the repair of the building (Civil Case No. 3092). 


Tan in his answer merely interposed the negative defense that his lease had not yet expired. He averred that the typhoon only partially destroyed the reconstructed building. 


In the City Court the parties entered into a stipulation of facts which included the lease contract, the injunction complaint in Civil Case No. 6868, the restraining order, Judge Suñga's order  denying the injunction, the record of the aforementioned certiorari case in the Court of Appeals, 
Vda. de Ignacio vs. Judge Suñga
, CA-G.R. No. 44657-R, October 28, 1970, the record of the  certifying case in this Court, 
Tan vs. Vda. de Ignacio
, L-33170, the contract of sublease dated September  25, 1970 and the sublessee's affidavit wherein it was stated that the sublease would take effect on October 1, 1970 when the lease contract between Tan  and Mrs Ignacio would expire. 


On March 26, 1973 the City Court issued a ruling disallowing cross-examination questions to Mrs. Ignacio which would revive the issue as to the expiration of the lease. 


Tan moved for the reconsideration of that ruling. The City Court denied his motion. It assumed that this Court in its minute resolution dismissing Tan's appeal had affirmed the finding of the Court of Appeals that the lease expired on October 1, 1970. The City Court said that it had ""no legal authority to set aside"" this Court's resolution. It cited the ruling that a final judgment of this Court ""is binding on all inferior courts, and hence beyond their power and authority to  alter or modified"" (Macansantos  Ns Fernan, 112 Phil. 1100). 


In view of the City Court's refusal to entertain evidence on the expiration of the lease, Tan did not present any evidence. On July 31, 1973 the City Court rendered a decision ejecting Tan and his  sublessee It adhered to the Appellate Court's finding that the lease expired on October 1, 1970. It ordered the defendants to pay solidarily to Mrs. Ignacio a monthly rental of five hundred pesos beginning October, 1970. 


Tan, appealed. The case was assigned to Judge Suñga (Civil Case No. 7580), the same Judge who in 1970 denied Mrs. Ignacio's petition to enjoin Tan from reconstructing the building. 


Tan filed a memorandum praying that the City Court's decision be set aside and that the case be remanded to the  inferior court for the reception of his evidence. Mrs. Ignacio in her memorandum prayed that the City Court's decision be affirmed.


Judge Suñga in his order of April 30, 1975 disregarded the finding of the Court of Appeals that Tan's lease expired on October 1, 1970. Judge  Suñga said 






With due respect to the better opinion of the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, this Court finds no ground for the said Courts to ride on the expiration of the contract of lease (Exh. A) as the same was not in issue. ... What was in issue raised by the pleadings and/or  prayers of the appellant was an injunction  to prevent the appellee Sixto Tan and his agent from continuing the reconstruction of a  new commercial building as provided for in par. 10 (Exh. A-7) of the lease contract between them. 






Judge Suñga, disagreeing with the Court of Appeals, ruled that the lease had not yet expired,  the ordered the remand of the ejectment case to  the City Court for the reception of Tan's evidence ""pursuant to his answer to the complaint and rebut whatever evidence that the plaintiff has presented"".  


Mrs Ignacio moved for the reconsideration of Judge Suñga's order. She cited the elementary rule that an inferior court has no  legal authority to set aside a final and executory judgment of this Court and grant new trial (Usaffe Veterans Association, Inc. vs. Treasurer of the Philippines, L-18393, December 17, 1966, 18 SCRA 1091). 


Judge  Suñga denied Mrs. Ignacio's motion for reconsideration in his order (if July 7, 1975. He in effect held that the Court of  Appeals could not rule on the expiration of the lease because that matter was allegedly not in issue; that its finding on that Point was an  
obiter dictum
 and that the question as to the expiration of the lease could  still  be litigated in the ejectment  case.


On  September 1, 1975 Mrs. Ignacio filed in this Court the  aforementioned special civil actions of certiorari mandamus and prohibition. She  contends that respondent Judge gravely  refused his discretion in not accepting the finding of the Court of A Is t hat the  lease  expired on October 1, 1970.  


The  issue is  whether  that finding is binding on the City Court anti Court of First Instance.  It should  be clarified that this Court did not affirm that finding. This Court merely refused to the decision of the Court of Appeals presumably because  Tan's appeal was  not warranted under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.  


We hold that finding  which is found in the body of the Decision of  the Court of Appeals as well as in the dispositive  portion of 
fallo
 thereof, is 
res judicata
 or is the law of the case  between  Tan and Mrs. Ignacio. It is  conclusive between them. It  is  beyond the  power of the lower court to alter or set aside. although it may be erroneous (Sec. 49 [c], Rule 39,  Rules of Court, 21 C.J.S. 330-331;  Peñalosa vs. Tuason, 22 Phil. 303, 312;  Peoples  Homesite and Housing Corporation vs. Mencias, L-24114, August 16, 1967, 20 SCRA 1031; People vs. Olarte, L-2244;5, February  25, 1967, 19 SCRA 494; Zarate vs. Director of  Lands Phil. 747; Rodriguez  s Director of Prisons, 28, 1972, 47 SCRA 153;  Balmes vs. Suson, L-27235,  May  22, 1969, 28 SCRA 304, National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority vs. NWSA Consolidated Union, L-26894-96, February 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 227).


That finding is the 
ratio decidendi
 of the decision of the Court of Appeals which held that the injunction action had become moot and academic, that Tan was a squatter, and that Mrs. Ignacio could judicially eject if he did not vacate the leased premises extrajudicially.


The Court of Appeals in its resolution of Tan's motion for reconsideration said that his contention that the term of the leased had not yet expired could be raised by him as a defense in the ejectment suit. That dictum did not impair the binding force of its conclusive finding that the leased had expired. It averred that the said finding was supported by the said record. By denying Tan's motion for reconsideration, the Court of Appeals in effect reiterated its decision that the injunction action had become moot because of the expiration of the lease on October 1, 1970.


Tan's contention that the off-mentioned conclusion of the Courts of Appeals on the expiration of the lease was merely tentative was belied by the tenor of its decision. Because of the expiration of the lease, the Court of Appeals held that Tan could be ejected from the leased premises; that there was no need for an injunction against him, and that he had no more right to reconstruct the burned building.


Tan further contends that if the lease had already expired, then an ejectment suit was not necessary for then there would be nothing more to decide. That contention is untenable. An ejectment suit was required because if Tan persisted in remaining in the leased premises, Mrs. Ignacio could not forcibly oust him therefrom. She would have no choice but to go to court. The Court of Appeals could not decree in the certiorari case that Tan should be ejected. Moreover, the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the lot should be ascertained in the ejectment suit.


Respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in not giving effect to the ruling of the Court of Appeals. He could express his honest conviction that it was an erroneous ruling that he could not refuse to give it effect (People v. Santos, 104 Phil. 551, 560; People vs. Vera, 65 Phil. 56, 82, Shioji vs. Harvey, 43 Phil. 333, 337). By not applying that ruling, he virtually nullified the decision of the Court of Appeals.


The lower court erred in remanding the ejectment suit to the City Court for the purpose of the receiving Tan's evidence in support of his defense that the lease had not yet expired. The lease contract is the best evidence on the expiration of the lease. Its provisions reveal that during the two-year period from the  time when the building was ready for occupancy (sometime in 1965 according to Mrs. Ignacio), no rentals were due because, obviously, the building, which would become the lessors' property, served as the compensation for Tan's use of the lot. 


During the remaining thirteen years, the subject matter of the lease was the building for which a monthly rental of three hundred pesos was due. Upon the expiration of the fifteen-year Period (which could have been in 1971 but which the Court of Appeals in its final judgment found to be October 1, 1970), the  case  could continue for another ten years (up to September 30, 1980)  It only with respect to the easements of right of way and light and view for which a monthly rental of one hundred fifty pesos would be paid by Tan to Mrs. Ignacio.


The lower court should decide Tan's appeal on the assumption that the case expired on October 1, 1970 since, as already stated, that finding is res judicata. It should find out whether the evidence presented by Mrs. Ignacio in the City Court is sufficient to sustain the  inferior court's finding that the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the one  Hundred eighty-one square meters originally leased by Tan is  five hundred pesos a month, and that Tan should pay P2,000 as attorney fees. 


WHEREFORE, respondent Judge's orders of April 30 and  July 7, 1975 are set aside. The  lower court is  directed to conduct further proceedings along the guidelines herein stated. It should  decided the ejectment suit by using as a basis the finding of tile Court of Appeals that the lease expired on October 1, 1970 and that Tan is a  squatter on the  lease premises.  No  costs.
