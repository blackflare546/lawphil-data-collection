ANTONIO, 
J.:


Appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Batangas in its Criminal Case No. 2466, dated March 23, 1968, the dispositive portion of which reads: 






WHEREFORE, the Court finds Gerardo Extra alias Handing in Criminal Case No. 2466 guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder with treachery as the qualifying circumstance and pursuant to Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code sentences him to undergo

The facts as found by the trial court are as follows: At about 7:00 o'clock in the evening of June 25, 1965, Leovigildo Saligao, Barrio Captain of Putingbuhangin, San Juan, Batangas, appeared at the PC Detachment Station at Putingbuhangin, San Juan, Batangas, seeking help from Sgt. Iglesias, Detachment Commander thereat, because according to him appellant Gerardo Extra alias 
Handing
 for no valid reason at all was threatening him with a firearm (carbine). Acceding to his request, Sgt. Leonardo Iglesias, Cpl. Inocentes Rabanilla, Sgt. Regalado and Cpl. Jose Pelayo accompanied Barrio Captain Saligao and proceeded to Putingbuhangin with Barrio Captain Saligao on the lead indicating the way. According to Cpl. Rabanilla, their purpose was to inquire from the appellant his motives in threatening Saligao and possibly to settle their differences, if any. Cpl. Rabanilla brought with him an automatic rifle, while Sgt. Iglesias had a carbine and a pistol and Cpl. Pelayo also a caliber.30 carbine. Barrio Captain Saligao was then unarmed. At first, they went to the house of Atanacio Extra, the father of appellant, at Putingbuhagin arriving there at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening. Upon arriving at the place, they engaged in conversation with Atanacio for about two (2) hours. In the meantime, Saligao requested Atanacio to send for Gerardo, in order that their misunderstanding, if any, can be settled in the presence of the constabulary authorities. Atanacio then requested Porfirio Aguila, his companion, to fetch his son, Gerardo Extra, whose house was only five (5) meters away. After a few minutes, Porfirio Aguila returned, only to inform them that Gerardo Extra was not in his house. Upon realizing the futility of contacting Gerardo Extra and because of the plea of Atanacio Extra that Saligao should forgive his son for whatever he has done,, Saligao informed the group that he was going home, while the soldiers decided to return to the PC station at Barrio Buhay na sapa. They left the yard of Atanacio Extra with Barrio Captain Saligao walking ahead illuminating now and then their path by means of his flashlight. As they were leaving the yard of Atanacio, Cpl. Rabanilla heard Saligao shout: ""There is Gerardo Extra"". At the moment, Cpl. Rabanilla saw, in the direction where the light of the flashlight of Saligao was focused, appellant Gerardo Extra about six (6) meters away, aiming a carbine at them and seeking cover behind a coconut tree. From that position, appellant fired at the group, hitting with the first volley Barrio Captain Saligao. Immediately, the constabulary soldiers took a prone position, fired warning shots in the air, and shouted at the appellant that they were police authorities. This was met by four (4) more gunshots from the appellant and the constabulary soldiers then returned the fire. After the firing ceased and upon finding that appellant had steady escaped, they went to the aid of Leovigildo Saligao who was seriously wounded. They called for civilians to get a hammock in order that they could bring Saligao to the road, from which place they could bring him to the nearest medical clinic. In the meantime, they called for appellant within the area surrounding the place where the shooting took place, but to no avail. When they found his wife they inquired for appellant's whereabouts but she claimed that she did not know where he was. They then carried Saligao to the clinic of Dr. Lasig at Lipa City for emergency treatment. Saligao was then in a very serious condition. It was inside the clinic at about midnight that the 
ante-mortem
 statement"" (Exhibit 'D') of Saligao, who was already gasping for breath, was taken by Pat. Tranquilino Sanchez in the presence of Pat. Apolonio Sadsad of the San Juan Police Force. In that statement, Saligao indicated that appellant Gerardo Extra was the person who shot him with an automatic carbine that night. The 
ante-mortem,
 statement was thumbmarked by Saligao with his blood in the presence of Sixto Razon and Pedro B. Saligao. The afore-mentioned statement is quoted as follows: 










Tanong:	Ano ang pangalan mo at taga saan ka? 


Sagot:	Leovigildo Saligao, taga Putingbuhangin, San Juan, Batangas. 


T 	Bakit ka may sugat sa iyong katawan?

S 	Sina Sgt. Leonardo Iglesias, Cpl. Inocentes Rabanilla at si Cpl. Jose Pelayo po. 


T 	Ikamamatay mo ba ang sugat mong iyan? 


S 	Opo. 










Early in the following morning, the constabulary soldiers reported the incident to the San Juan Police authorities. Cpl. Rabanilla and Sgt. Iglesias were the first to be investigated by PC Sgt. Jesus B. Brigola in the presence of Deputy Chief of Police Vicente C. Peradilla. Leovigildo Saligao died as a consequence of his wounds on July 4, 1965.

According to Chief of Police Daniel B. Mendoza, he came to learn of the shooting of Saligao at around 4:00 o'clock in the early morning of June 26, 1965. Upon receiving the information, he went to the scene of the incident. He found empty shells of Garand rifle on the ground. He looked for Gerardo Extra in his house but he was not there, neither was he in the house of his father nor in the house of any of his relatives. He also noted that the house of Extra was deserted. His search for Gerardo Extra in Putingkahoy and in Tikalan lasted up to 11:00 O'clock in the following morning, when he returned to the poblacion to investigate the persons who were present during the shooting. On the basis of his investigation, he filed with the Municipal Court of San Juan, Batangas, on June 26, 1965, a complaint for ""Frustrated Murder with Direct Assault Upon an Agent of a Person in Authority"" against Gerardo Extra alias Handing. This complaint was supported by the ante-mortem statement of Saligao and the sworn statements of Francisco Mendoza, Sgt. Leonardo Iglesias and Cpl. lnocentes Rabanilla. Armed with the warrant of arrest which was issued on the same date, he searched for appellant as far south as Quezon province, and as far north as Quezon City, but to no avail. It was only on January 7, 1967 when appellant was taken into custody by the police authorities. 


The defense of appellant is alibi, based on his own testimony, his father's Atanacio Extra) and that of Primo Bosa. According to Atanacio Extra, Barrio Captain Saligao was looking for his son on two occasions before the incident, the first at about 9:00 o'clock in the morning of June 25, 1965, and again at 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day when Saligao went to his house inquiring whether ""Pareng Handing"" (Gerardo Extra) had already returned. It was for this reason that at about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of that day he told his son to leave because Saligao told him that he would kill him. When Saligao came to his house, together with the PC soldiers on the night of June 25, 1965, he claimed that he was surprised to find the soldiers surrounding his house looking for his son. It was on that occasion when he was talking with one Vizmanos at the ricemill about 120 yards from his house that he heard the sound of gunfire. After the firing ceased, he together with Vizmanos, Gregorio and Hogpicio Manimtim, all carrying lighted torches, went back to his house. The following morning, when the Chief of Police arrived, he learned that Saligao was shot but he did not inquire from the Chief of Police whether Saligao was dead or not. 


Appellant, who claimed to be a cattle dealer, testified that after he was informed by his father in the afternoon of June 25, 1965 that Saligao was armed and was looking for him, he left their barrio for Rosario, Batangas because he feared that Saligao would harm him, as the latter was jealous of him because of his purported intimacy with a woman named ""Maring."" He declared that he spent the whole night of June 25, 1965 in the house of Rosy Aguirre in Batangas, Batangas, together with one Primo Bosa, in order to sell about ten (10) heads of cattle at the cattle market of Rosario. The following day his wife came to inform him that a shooting incident took place in Putingbuhangin and that he was being mentioned as the principal suspect. Upon receiving this information, he left Batangas for Lobo in the afternoon of June 26, 1965 and stayed in the house of Felipe Aguirre at Barrio Maybanga for about a week. He surrendered to the Provincial Governor of Batangas on January 6, 1967. Primo Bosa, a farmer of Barrio Antipolo, Rosario, Batangas, attempted to corroborate, the presence of appellant in the house of Rosy Aguirre at Kumintang Batangas, Batangas in the night of June 25, 1965. 


Appellant contends in this appeal that his Identification as the assailant of the deceased is ""open to very serious doubts and not entirely free from suspicion"" because of (1) the non-presentation of the flashlight as well as the empty shells as evidence; (2) the failure of the other PC soldiers to corroborate Cpl. Rabanilla's testimony; (3) the admission of Rabanilla that ""the person who fired at their group was behind the coconut trunk lying down on his belly and (4) the suddenness of the attack which makes ""the Identification of the attacker practically nil or impossible."" 


It must be remembered that Cpl. Rabanilla, at the time he made recognition of appellant, was only about six (6) meters away from the latter and was able to recognize him because the beam of the flashlight being held by the barrio captain (Saligao) was then focused upon the face of the appellant. At that precise moment, the barrio captain was also able to recognize him because he exclaimed: ""There is Gerardo Extra"". At that time, appellant was then in the act of seeking cover behind a coconut tree, and from his vantage point, fired at the group of Saligao mortally hitting with the first volley the said barrio captain. It cannot be denied that appellant was familiar and known to both the barrio captain and Cpl. Rabanilla and certainly they count not possibly have been mistaken as to his Identity. Shortly prior to the shooting, Cpl. Rabanilla saw appellant hanging by the rear steps of a jeepney and he had to persuade him to desist from so doing. As regards Saligao, he is a barriomate of appellant and it was precisely upon his complaint that the constabulary soldiers went to Barrio Putingbuhangin to look for the appellant. 


We are convinced that both Rabanilla and Saligao were able to recognize appellant under the circumstances mentioned above. For a person may be recognized by means of his face, height, movement and the shape of his body by someone who is familiar with his features. 
1
 In a, previous case, this Court held that the testimony of a witness that he was able to recognize the assailant from the flash of the shots that were fired by him because he was only one (1) meter away from the said assailant while the latter was continuously firing shots at the victim is not necessarily incredible. 
2
 In 
People v. Francisco
 
3


 this Court observed that a participant in a crime could be recognized by persons who know him by the light of a match struck to light a cigarette. Its is not even necessary that ""the movements and appearances of a person be so marked, peculiar, or unusual for people who know him well enough to readily Identify him ."" 
4


 


The Identification of appellant is further enhanced by tie fact that immediately the follow ng day, Cpl. Rabanilla and Sgt. Iglesias executed sworn statements before the municipal judge of San Juan, Batangas, narrating in detail the circumstances under which they recognized the appellant. The early revelation by the said prosecution witnesses of the Identity of appellant as the assailant, which led to the immediate filing of the criminal charge, in the absence of any improper motive, shows spontaneity and sincerity.
5
 


The circumstance that, the flashlight was not presented at the trial is of no moment. The existence of said flashlight was never questioned by the defense at the trial. It must be recalled that from the records of the preliminary investigation, the sworn statements of Sgt. Iglesias and Cpl. Rabanilla in said investigation clearly and categorically indicated that they were able to recognize Gerardo Extra because of the flashlight carried by Barrio Captain Saligao. If there was any doubt of the existence of such flashlight, certainly the defense could have raised that question then, but it could not do so for the first time on appeal. 


Neither can We attach much importance to the fact that the appellant remained unscathed in spite of the number of shots fired by the PC soldiers. It must be recalled that the soldiers were caught by surprise by the sudden gunfire from the appellant. Considering the fact that the place of appellant was dark, as Saligao had already fallen to the ground with his flashlight after the initial burst of fire, and the circumstance that appellant was lying on his belly behind the, coconut trees, it is, therefore, not strange that appellant was unharmed. 


Nor can We construe in a manner adverse to the prosecution the failure of the State to call on Sgt. Iglesias to corroborate the testimony of Cpl. Rabanilla. As shown by the record, Sgt. Iglesias had executed a sworn statement on June 26, 1965. before the municipal judge, corroborating in detail the Identification of appellant made by Rabanilla. The statement of Rabanilla before said municipal judge is, in substance, the same as his testimony in court. Under the circumstances, Iglesias' testimony would be merely corroborative and, therefore, his non- presentation as a witness does not mean suppression of the testimony that is adverse to the prosecution. 
6
 


On appellant's contention that Exhibit ""D"" is not an 
ante-mortem
 statement and, therefore, should not have been admitted, We declare that whether or not one making a dying declaration was without hope of recovery is a question of fact for the trial court. We are convinced, however, that at the time Saligao executed his declaration (Exhibit ""D"") at about midnight of June 25, 1965, he was then convincing that he was going to die. He was seriously wounded, the bullet having pierced thru and thru his right chest. He was gasping for breath. Tranquilino Sanchez, who took down this statement of the deceased, declared that he noticed his serious condition. His Identification of the appellant as the person who shot him is clear and categorical. The fact that he died days later is of no moment. The admissibility of an 
ante-mortem
 declaration is not affected by the fact that the declarant died hours or several days after making his declaration. It is sufficient that he believed himself in imminent danger of death at the time of such declaration. 
7
 This was clearly explained in 
People v. Cord.
 
8
 






We have no decisions in this state declaring the meaning of the phrase la dying person, in section 1870 of the Code of Civil Procedure It does not mean that in order to make such declaration admissible the person making it must be at the time in the act of expiring, or in the final death struggle. It is seldom that a human Being in that stage of dissolution is capable of making any statement whatsoever in the nature of a connected or reliable narrative or account of a past transaction. To admit such declarations only when made by a person in that condition would Practically exclude them altogether, or render them useless for any purpose. We think the intention of the codifiers was to express, as clearly and comprehensively as was compatible with the necessary brevity the rule on the subject of the admissibility of dying declarations as it had previously existed. By this rule it was not necessary that the person should be at the time in the throes of death, or that he should die immediately, or within any specified time thereafter, in order to give the declaration probative force 1 Greenleaf on Ev S 158; Roscoe Crime. E I 37 (8th Ed.) 61; 21 Cc 978- State %,. Nash, 7 Iowa, 381; Hall v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 177, 15 S. i. 517; Swisher v. Commonwealth, 26 Grat. (Va.) 963, 971, 21 Am. Dec. 330; State %,. Reed 53 Kan. 773, 37 Pac. 174, 42 Am. St. Rep 322; State v. Kilgore 70 Mo. 553; State v. Tilghman 33 N. C. 513. It was considered that the belief that a fatal wound had been received, and that death was about to ensue therefrom, would deter such person from uttering a willful untruth about its cause, if not as effectively as would the sanction of an oath, reinforced by the earthly penalty for its violation. at. least sufficiently to justify its admission as evidence of the facts recounted. Where a Person his been fatally wounded, is in sore distress there from and Believes that he will not recover, and is soon await to file his statement, made in this belief, relating to the caused of his injury is dismissible, if it appears that he subsequently 3, died from the direct effects of the wound although he may have revived after making the statement, or may have lived a considerable time thereafter, and may have again begun to hope for recovery. Such person is to be deemed 'a driving person' within the meaning of the statute from the time the wound is received until death results from the injury and his statement during that period, made in view of death and in the Belief that it is near at hand, may be proven to establish the cause of death. In the Present case, the evidence shows that this wound as necessarily, fatal, and that his dissolution therefrom was in Progress continuously from the beginning to the close. The remarkable thing is that he lived so long in such a condition. He was never on the road to recovered as appellant contends, but was constant on the Drink of death from a recurrence of hemorrhage. He believed his death imminent at the time he made the statement. The fact that he and others ma have afterwards entertained a false hope of recovered could not have affected the solemnity or veracity of his statement, nor have made him other than a dying person, in the sense of the statute, at the time the Statement was made. 






It is contended, however, that the deceased Leovigildo Saligao was jealous of appellant Gerardo Extra, as the former suspected the latter of trying to steal ""Maring"", his ""paramour"", and, therefore, ""his declaration might have been influenced by the passion of anger and vengeance .... But this statement rests only on the uncorraborated assertion of the appellant. It is based on mere conjectures. No direct evidence has been submitted to show the purported relationship of Soligao with this woman. According to the appellant, he was merely passing by the house of this woman who is merely Identified as ""Maring"" (her real name not having been shown) and only talked with her on the street when greeted her as he passed by. Under such palpably innocent circumstances, even assuming that Soligao had relation with a woman, how could it be rationally concluded that the barrio captain, on the basis thereof, suspected appellant of ""stealing the love of his paramour""?


On the defense of alibi, it must be recalled that in order that an alibi as a defense may prosper, the evidence to support it must be clear and convincing as to preclude the possibility of the presence of the accused at the scene at the crime, while the evidence as to his Identification must be weak and insufficient. According to Atanacio Extra, he told his son Gerardo, at 4:30 p.m. on June 25, 1965, to gave away because Saligao was looking for him, and it was because of this that his son left their barrio. How could We reconcile this with the unrebutted testimony of Cpl. Rabanilla that when they arrived at the house of Atanacio Extra looking for Gerardo Extra, Atanacio sent Porfirio Aguila to fetch Gerardo from his house and after a few minutes, Aguila returned and said that Gerardo had ""just left the house? 9 If it were true that early that afternoon Atanacio knew that appellant had already left their barrio, why should he still send statement from Aguila that Gerardo only left his house that night and not earlier in the afternoon:


It must be noted also that while appellant claimed that he spent the night of June 25, 1965 in the house of Mrs. Rosy Aguirre at Barrio Kumintang, Batangas, Batangas because he used to sell cattel in said town, he could not produced any license or any document showing that he was really a, cattle dealer, much less could he explain his failure to explain the inability of Mrs. Aguirre to corroborate his testimony, If it were true that he left Barrio Putingbuhangin because he was afraid that Saligao would kill him, no explanations had been given why he did not report the purported threat on his life either to the PC detachment at the adjacent barrio of Buhay na sapa while waiting for a jeep to the poblacion of San Juan, Batangas, or to the police of San Juan, upon arriving at the poblacion, or to the police at Batangas, Batangas, where he was for about two days, or to the police authorities at Lobo, Batangas, where he stayed for about a week after leaving the house of Mrs. Aguirre. 


The testimony of Primo Bosa to the effect that he slept with appellant in the night of June 25, 1965 appears to be an afterthought. It is difficult to believe that this witness, living in a barrio near Taysan where fertilizer is sold, would go all the was to Batangas, Batangas to. purchase his fertilizer, which is not only much farther but would cost more because of the added cost of transportation. At any ratio upon reaching Batangas, Batangas at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon, instead of buying the fertilizer and return to his barrio, he preferred to while away his time in the house of Mrs. Aguirre at Barrio Kumintang for the entire evening of June 25, 1965. His declaration is flawed by inconsistencies. While he pretends to possess an accurate memory of all the events that occurred on June 25, 1965 when he purportedly slept with appellant, he exhibits poor recollection of the details of events that transpired recently 


There is also the admission of appellant that, as early as 11:00 a.m. on June 26, 1965, he learned from his wife that he was suspected of the killing of Saligao And yet no plausible explanation has been given why he did not bother to appear before any of the governmental authorities in the towns where he reportedly stayed to Show his innocence. On the other hand, c eluded the authorities and abandoned his family from June 26, 1965 until January 6, 1967. Unexplained flight of an accused : from his native town and family following the commission of he crime, and abandonment of his business, particulars where t is surreptitious, coupled with his failure to communicate to he authorities his whereabouts, has been considered indication of consciousness of guilt. 
10
 Indeed, the alibi of appellant ""has all the characteristics of a story designed to fit the intended purpose of showing the whereabouts of the defendant to be in a place other than where the crime was committed at the time of its commission. 
11


We find, therefore, that the trial court did not commit any error in finding appellant guilty of the crime of murder. The civil indemnity in favor of the heirs of the deceased should, however, be increased by ordering appellant to indemnify the heirs of Leovigildo Saligao in the amount of P12,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. 


WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from, with the afore-stated modification, is hereby affirmed.
