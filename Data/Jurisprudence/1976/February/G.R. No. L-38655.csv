JOINT MANIFESTATION AND MOTION


COME NOW the parties, assisted by counsel, and respectfully manifested:


1	There has been pending in the Court of Industrial Relations since August 20, 1958 CIR Case No. 1099-V, entitled 'Halili Bus Drivers & Conductors Union (PTGWO) vs. Fortunato F. Halili, doing business under the name and stule 'Halili Transit', which originated as a claim by a number of unnamed employees of Halili Transit for overtime compensation. In the ten years that the said case had been pending, the following relevant incidents have taken place therein:


a)	On August 7, 1961, the trial judge of the Court of Industrial Relations issued a Decision holding that certain operations performed by the union members-claimants in the case were legally compensable but not compensated, and ordering the Court Examiner to compute the amount due to the claimants under the decision.


b)	On February 26, 1968, this Honorable Court held in G.R. No. 

L-24864 that the aforesaid decision of the Court of Industrial Relations had become final and executory. For thisreason, this Honorable Court denied the petition of the Administratrix of the estate of the late Fortunato F. Halili for the dismissal of the CIR Case (No. 1099-V) so as to enable the claimants to file their claims in the proper estate proceedings. 


c)	Complying with the order of the Court of Industrial Relations to compute the liability of Halili Transit to the claimants on the basis of the guidelines established by the said Court, the Court Examiner submitted his report dated April 28, 1972 in which the liability of Halili was placed at an aggregate amount of P3,812,039.55. 


d)	Alleging, among others, that the guidelines on which the computation used by the Court Examiner were contrary to law, the Administratrix of the estate of Fortunato F. Halili, who is now also the Administratrix of the estate of his wife, elevated the case on certiorari to this Honorable Court through the instant case. 


2.	In the course of the hearing on whether or not this petition was to be given due course by this Honorable Court, the Justices of this Division expressed their great concern at the fact that the case had been pending for so long without any relief having been given to the former employees and strongly urged the parties to arrive at some amicable settlement that would do substantial justice to the employees in order to forestall any further protraction of the case, particularly in view of the abolition of the Court of Industrial Relations, and yet not unduly cause hardship on the part of the heirs and estate of Fortunato F. Halili. 


3.	In the case of this strong urging on the part of this Honorable Court upon the parties to put an immediate end to the case by amicable settlement, the parties repeatedly came to conference, conscientiously explored all avenues of settlement, and finally arrived at an agreement embodied in the attached Memorandum of Agreement with Release and Quitclaim which is made a part hereof as Annex 'A'. 


WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is respectfully moved that the Memorandum of Agreement with Release and Quitclaim, Annex 'A', be approved by this Honorable Court and that CIR Case No. 1099-V be dismissed with prejudice.""

Halili, doing business under the name and style 'Halili Transit', which originated as a claim by a number of unnamed employees of Halili Transit for overtime compensation. In the ten years that the said case has been pending, the following relevant incidents have taken place therein: 


1.	On August 7, 1961, the CIR issued a Decision holding that certain operations performed by the petitioner laborers legally compensable but not compensated, and ordering the Court Examiner to compute the amount due to the petitioner employees under the decision. 


2.	On February 26, 1968, the Supreme Court held in G.R. No. L-24864 that the aforesaid decision of the Court of Industrial Relations had become final and executory. For this reason, the Supreme Court denied the petition of the Administratrix of the estate of the late Fortunato F. Halili for the dismissal of the CIR Case (No. 1099-V) so as to enable the petitioner-employees to file their claims in the proper estate case. 


3.	Complying with the order of the Court of Industrial Relations to compute the liability of Halili Transit to the petitioner- employees on the basis of the guidelines established by the said court, the Court Examiner submitted his report dated April 28,1972 in which the liability of Halili was placed to aggregate P3,812,039.55. 


4.	Alleging that the guidelines on which the computation u by the Court Examiner were contrary to law, the Administratrix of the estate of Fortunato F. Halili, who is now also the Administratrix of the estate of his wife, elevated the case to the Supreme Court on certiorari in G.R. No. L-38655.
