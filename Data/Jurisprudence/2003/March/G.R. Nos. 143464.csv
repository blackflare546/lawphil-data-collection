In general, violation of the rule on forum shopping should be raised at the earliest opportunity in a motion to dismiss or a similar pleading.   Invoking it in the later stages of the proceedings or on appeal may result in the dismissal of the action as an exception only if the violation arises from or will result in (1) the loss of jurisdiction over the subject matter,  (2) the 
pendency
 of another action between the same parties for the same cause, (3) the barring of the action by a prior judgment, or (4) the crossing of the Statute of Limitations.

The case was docketed thereat as Civil Case No. 96-9508.  The private respondent subsequently filed an Amended Complaint with the same Court.

The case was docketed in that court as Civil Case No. 97-9830.  Young filed a Motion to Dismiss the case on the ground that the ‘complaint fails to state a good, valid and/or worthwhile cause of action against the defendant.’  The respondent court denied the Motion to Dismiss in its order of August 19, 1997.  The petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the aforesaid order based on the following grounds:
