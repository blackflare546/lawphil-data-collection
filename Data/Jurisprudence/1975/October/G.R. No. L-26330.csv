R E S O L U T I O N 




AQUINO, 
J.:
Interisland Terminal Corporation appeal on legal question from the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila dated May 13, 1966, overruling its objection to the provisional award to Guacods, Inc. and E. Razon, Inc. of the arrastre service contract in the Port of Manila for a six-month period starting on May 1 and ending on October 27, 1966 (Civil Case No. 58466).


That trial operation of the arrastre service was later superseded by the award on October 29, 1966 to Guacods, Inc. and E. Razon, Inc. of the operation of the arrastre service for a period of five years which expired on April 30, 1971.


In view of that supervening circumstance, the Court in its resolution of July 9, 1975 required the parties to manifest whether the appeal in this case (submitted for decision on February 17, 1967) had become moot and academic.


Petitioner Guacods, Inc., intervenor-appellant Interisland Terminal Corporation, respondents-appellees Commissioner of Customs and Secretary of Finance, plaintiff and intervenor-appellee E. Razon, Inc. and intervenor-appellee Associated Workers' Union manifested that the case had become moot.


Wherefore, the appeal is dismissed without costs. So ordered.


Barredo, (Actg. Chairman), Antonio, Muñoz Palma and Martin, JJ., concur.


Fernando and Concepcion, Jr. JJ., are on leave.
