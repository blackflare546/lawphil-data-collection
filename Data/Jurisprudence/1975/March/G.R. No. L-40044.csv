Acting on the motion of the Solicitor General to reset the hearing of this case set for March 19, 1975 to a later date, and upon consideration of the answer of respondents wherein the filing of the amended information including petitioner as an accused in Criminal Case No. 10197 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal for homicide together with four other accused, despite the previous opinion of the investigating and reviewing fiscals to the contrary, is explained to be in accordance with law, said inclusion having been ordered by the Secretary of Justice by virtue of his powers of supervision and control over the work of fiscals as defined and discussed in 
Estrella vs. Orendain
