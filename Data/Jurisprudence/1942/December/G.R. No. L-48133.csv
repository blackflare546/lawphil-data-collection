BOCOBO, 
J.:


PUBLIC EXTRAJUDICIAL SALE; PUBLICATION OF NOTICE IN NEWSPAPER. — Section 3 of Act No. 3135 merely requires that the notice be published ""in a newspaper of general circulation."" The newspaper need not have the largest circulation, so long as it is of general circulation. It is presumed that the requisites of the law regarding publication in a newspaper of general circulation have been complied with, which presumption has not been successfully rebutted by appellee. 
Held: 
That the publication of the notice of sale in the newspaper 
La Opinion, 
together with the posting of the notice at the municipal building, the public market and the cockpit, was a sufficient compliance with the law. By such publication and posting, a reasonable publication and posting, a reasonable publicity had been made so that those interested might attend the public sale.
