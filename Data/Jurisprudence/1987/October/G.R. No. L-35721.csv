WELDON CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION, 
petitioner,

vs.


COURT OF APPEALS (Second Division) and MANUEL CANCIO, 
respondents. 




CORTES, 
J.:


The present controversy arose from the construction of the Gay Theater building on the corner of Herran and Singalong Streets in Manila. Petitioner WELDON CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION sued the private respondent Manuel Cancio in the then Court of First Instance of Manila to recover P62,378.82 Pesos, which is ten per (10%) of the total cost of construction of the building, as commission, and P23,788.32 Pesos as cost of additional works thereon. 


The basis for the claim for commission is an alleged contract of supervision of construction between the theater owner Manuel Cancio, herein private respondent, and the petitioner's predecessors-in-interest, Weldon Construction, which the petitioner seeks to enforce. The private respondent refused to pay the amounts demanded on the ground that the Gay Theater building was constructed by Weldon Construction for the stipulated price of P600,000.00 Pesos which has already been fully paid. The irreconcilable positions taken by the parties brought the controversy before the courts. 


Two documents, Exhibit ""A"" and Exhibit ""5,"" were produced by the plaintiff and the defendant, respectively, before the trial court. Plaintiff, herein petitioner sought the enforcement of the alleged contract of supervision contained in Exhibit ""A,"" which is quoted below:

SIGNED IN THE PRESENCE OF: 


__________________	______________________


The then Court of First, instance of Manila ruled that the agreement between the parties is a 
contract of supervision of construction 
found in Exhibit ""A"" and ordered the theater-owner Cancio to pay the ten per cent (10%) supervision fee or commission provided for in said contract (Record on Appeal, p. 91). On appeal by the defendant Cancio, the Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's Decision and dismissed the Complaint. The appellate court held that the transaction between the parties is a 
construction contract for a stipulated price
 contained in Exhibit ""5"" (Rollo, pp. 53-62 [Court of Appeals Decision]) The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision promulgated on December 23, 1971 reads:




WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is reversed and set aside. Let another issue dismissing plaintiff's complaint and ordering ph&tiff to pay defendant-appellant P5,000.00 as moral damages, P4,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P4,000.00 as attorney's fees. Costs against plaintiff-appellee in both instances.


SO ORDERED. (Rollo, p. 64) 




Both parties moved for the reconsideration of the aforesaid Decision. Plaintiff-appellee WELDON CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION assailed the Decision as a whole and reiterated its claims. Defendant-appellant sought an increase in the amount of damages and attomey's fees awarded. In a Resolution dated February 7, 1972, the same division of the Court of Appeals denied the two Motions for Reconsideration. Upon a Second Motion for Reconsideration filed by the plaintiff-appellee, the Court of Appeals modified its Decision of December 23, 1971 as follows:




IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, We hereby maintain the decision of December 23, 1971, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint, with the modification that defendant's counterclaim are also dismissed, without pronouncement as to attorney's fees and costs. 


SO ORDERED. (Resolution, October 18, 1972; [Rollo, p. 124]) 




Not satisfied with the Resolution of its Second Motion for Reconsideration, plaintiff-appellee WELDON CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION elevated its case to this Tribunal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. 


1.	The Court is called upon to ascertain whether or not a commission of ten per cent (10%) of the total cost of construction of the Gay Theater building should be paid by the private respondent pursuant to the alleged contract of supervision of construction which the petitioner seeks to enforce. Stated otherwise, the principal issue presented is whether the agreement between the parties is a contract of supervision of construction on commission basis, in which the case commission will be legally demandable, or a construction contract for a stipulated price which has already been consummated. The ancillary issue is whether or not the petitioner can recover the cost of additional works on the building. The task at hand entails the interpretation of the true agreement between the parties, which is in effect an inquiry into the ""law"" imposed by the parties upon their contractual relations. Since a contract is in the nature of ""law"" as between the parties and their successors-in-interest its interpretation necessarily involves a question of law (Melliza v. City of Iloilo, L-24732, April 30, 1968, 23 SCRA 477, 481) properly raised in this certiorari proceeding under Rule 45. 


2.	The facts are not disputed. It appears from the records that in 1961 Lucio Lee, whose name was later changed to Lucio Lee Rodriguez, was doing business under the trade name Weldon Construction, the predecessor-in-interest of the herein petitioner, WELDON CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION. The latter corporation was incorporated in July, 1963 as a closed corporation composed of Lucio Tee (owner of Weldon Construction), his wife, his sister and the latter's husband, and a cousin. The assets of Weldon Construction were transferred to, and its liabilities assumed by the new corporation. Hence, the instant case was brought by WELDON CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION as successor-in-interest of Weldon Construction and Lucio Lee.


Prior to March 7, 1961, Lucio Lee drafted plans for a theater-apartment building which private respondent Cancio intended to put up. Thereafter, on March 7, 1961, he submitted to the latter a proposal (Exhibit ""A"") for the supervision of the construction of said building on commission basis. The proposal was signed not by Lee but by his office manager, Antonio Wong. The private respondent never affixed his signature on the document.


Among the provisions Contained in the proposal was the setting up of a revolving fund of P10,000.00 Pesos for the costs and expenditures to be incurred in the construction of the building, such as materials and labor among others (Exhibit ""A"", par. 1). The fund was to be replenished by the owner of the building from time to time (
Id
). The proposal also provided for the payment to Weldon Construction of a commission of ten per cent (10%) of the total cost of the building (
Id.
, par. 5) 


Without having signed the proposal Exhibit ""A"" or any written agreement on the construction of the building, private respondent Cancio gave an advance payment of P10,000.00 Pesos. Then, on March 28, 1961, Lee submitted another proposal (Exhibit ""4"") this time for the construction of the same building at the stipulated price of P600,000.00 Pesos. Two days after, Lee sent the private respondent a prepared ""Building Contract"" (Exhibit ""5"") signed by him for the signature of the latter and those of the witnesses. Private respondent did not return the document to Lee, but the petitioner started the construction of the building. When the document (Exhibit ""5"") was later presented in court, it contained the signatures of Lee, as well as the signatures of Manuel Cancio, that of his wife, giving her marital consent, and those of two witnesses. 


As the construction of the theater building shifted to high gear, subsequent payments were made by respondent Cancio to Weldon Construction 
as per accomplishment
 in the varying amounts of P70,000.00 Pesos (Court of Appeals Decision, Rollo, p. 56; Exhibits ""8-18""). The materials were bought and paid for by the contractor, although the invoices were in the name of the owner, evidently to avoid payment by the former of the three per cent (3%) contractor's tax. (Court of Appeals Decision, Rollo, p. 59). The invoices, receipts of payment, vouchers and payrolls were not surrendered to the owner but were kept by the contractor. (
Id
. p. 57). 


Shortly after the completion of the theater building and its delivery to the owner, the latter completed the payment of the P600,000.00 contract price (CA Decision, Rollo, p. 59). However, Weldon Construction demanded the payment of P62,378.83 Pesos, as a commission of ten per cent (10%) of the total cost of construction and of P23,788.32 Pesos as the cost of the ""extra works"" on the building. The owner Cancio denied the existence of any agreement on the payment of commission and refused to pay the amounts demanded. Hence, this suit initiated by the WELDON CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION, the successor-in-interest of Lucio Lee and Weldon Construction.


3.	A careful scrutiny of each and every term and stipulation in the two documents Exhibit ""A"" and Exhibit """"5"" revealed two differences between them which are crucial to this case. One basic difference between the two agreements lies in the proposed consideration for the administration or supervision services. Proposed under Exhibit ""A"" was Ten Per cent (10%) of the total cost of construction (Exh. ""A"", par. 5) without a maximum amount set as a limit on that cost. In contrast, Exhibit ""5"" sets the stipulated price of the construction of the building at P600,000.00 Pesos, which is the consideration of the contract (Exhibit ""5"" par. 4). The other point of divergence is the manner in which the expenses for labor and materials are provided for. Exhibit ""A"", sets up a revolving fund of P10,000.00 Pesos to be paid by the Owner and to be replenished by him from time to time, which fund shall answer for the various costs of construction including labor and materials (Exh. ""A"" par. 1). No such fund is provided for in Exhibit ""5"" since the Contractor Weldon Construction binds itself to supply the labor and materials (Exh. ""5"", par. 2). 


The first proposal submitted by Weldon Construction for rendering service under a contract of supervision (Exhibit ""A"") is simply that, a proposal. It never attained perfection as the contract between the parties. Only an absolute or unqualified acceptance of a definite offer manifests the consent necessary to perfect a contract (Article 1319, New Civil Code). The advance payment of P10,000.00 Pesos was not an unqualified acceptance of the offer contained in the first proposal (Exhibit ""A"") as in fact an entirely new proposal (Exhibit ""4"") was submitted by Weldon Construction subsequently. If, as claimed by the petitioner, the parties had already agreed upon a contract of supervision under Exhibit ""A,"" why then was a second proposal made? 
Res ipsa loquitur. 
The existence of the second proposal belies the perfection of any contract arising from the first proposal .


With regard to the second proposal (Exhibit ""4"") for the construction of the building at a stipulated price, the same was closely followed by the ""Building Contract"" (Exhibit ""5"") signed by Lee, setting forth m detail the proposed terms and stipulations. Although the petitioner claims that the contract was never returned to its predecessors-in-interest, it appears upon the face of the document (Exhibit ""5"") that the same was signed by the contracting parties and their witnesses. Petitioner does not question the authenticity of the signature of its predecessors-in-interest, Lucio Lee, appearing on the document (Exhibit ""5""). Lee himself has admitted said signature as his. Petitioner, however, impugns the binding effect of the Building Contract (Exhibit ""5"") by assailing its due execution. It cans the attention of the Court to the conclusion of the trial court that the signature of the defendant (herein private respondent) and that of the witness Martinez were affixed on said contract after its purported date of execution on March 30, 1961 (Record on Appeal, pp. 89-90). 


Petitioner's position is untenable. Once a contract is shown to have been consummated or fully performed by the parties thereto, its existence and binding effect can no longer be disputed. It is irrelevant and immaterial to dispute the due execution of a contract. i.e.. the date of signing by one of the parties, if bath of them have in fact performed their obligations thereunder and their respective signatures and those of their witnesses appear upon the face of the document. 


Thus, even as that the Building Contract in Exhibit ""5"", was signed by the private respondent only 
after
 the Gay Theater building had been completed and the stipulated price of P600,000.00 Pews fully paid, such fact can no longer negate the binding effect of that agreement if its existence and especially, its 
consummation
 can be established by other evidence, e.g. by the contemporaneous acts of the parties and their having performed their respective obligations pursuant to the agreement. As held in Kriedt v. E.C. McCullough & Co., 37 Phil. 474,480 (1918)




. . . Acts done by the parties to a contract in the course of its performance am admissible in evidence upon the question of its meaning as being their own contemporaneous interpretation of its terms. (Cited in Manila Electric Company v. Court of Appeals, L-33794, May 31, 1982, 114 SCRA 173, 181) 




A similar pronouncement was made by the Court in Shell Company of the Philippines, Ltd. v. Firemen's Insurance CO. of Newark, 100 Phil. 757 (1957), to wit: 




To determine the nature of a contract courts do not have or are not bound to rely upon the name or title given it by the contracting parties, should there be a controversy as to what they really had intended to enter into, but the way the contracting parties do or perform their respective obligations, stipulated or agreed upon may be shown and inquired into, and should such performance conflict with the name given the contract by the parties, the former must prevail over the latter (cited in Borromeo v. Court of Appeals, L-22962, September 28, 1972, 47 SCRA 65, 74).




Thus, the manner in which the parties conducted their transactions relating to the construction of the Gay Theater building indicates whether the parties had intended to be bound by a construction contract for a stipulated price or by any other agreement. The demandability of the amounts sought to be recovered by the petitioner will depend on the nature of that agreement. 


In this case, the Court finds that the parties adhered to the terms and stipulations of the Building Contract (Exhibit ""5""). After said contract hewing the signature of the contractor Lee was submitted for the signature of the respondent Cancio, subsequent payments were made by the latter in amounts ranging from P25,000.00 Pesos to P70,000.00 Pesos. Even granting that the P10,000.00 Pesos advance payment by the owner was set up as a revolving fund, these relatively large amounts could hardly be considered as mere replenishments of said initial amount. As correctly reasoned out in the Decision of the Court of Appeal (Rollo, p. 56), replenishments of the P10,000.00 - peso revolving fund could not exceed that amount. The remittances made by the building owner were actually partial payments of the contract price of P600,000.00 Pesos, the amount having been based on the actual accomplishment of the construction during the period covered by the payment. Thus, the receipts issued by Weldon Construction contained the words, ""as per accomplishment"" (Exhibits ""8""-""18""). The aforecited acts of the parties with respect to said remittances are in consonance with paragraph 4 of the Building Contract (Exhibit ""5""), to wit:




xxx			xxx			xxx


4.	The Owner shall pay the Contractor the full amount of SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND (PM,000.00) PESOS Philippine Currency, which payment the Owner shall pay in (sic) the basis of work accomplished based on breakdowns attached herewith marked Annex ""B"" and ""C"". Such payments shall be paid on the tenth of every month. Ten per cent retention of every payment shall be retained by the Owner, to be paid upon the completion of the project;


xxx			xxx			xxx




The inescapable conclusion is that Weldon Construction assumed the obligation to construct the building at the price fixed by the parties and to furnish both the labor and materials required for the project. It acted as an independent contractor within the meaning of Article 1713 of the New Civil Code, which states:




ART. 1713.	By the contract for a piece of work the contractor binds himself to execute a piece of work for the employer, in consideration of a certain price or compensation. The contractor may either employ only his labor or skill or also furnish the materials.




In view of all the foregoing considerations this Court finds that the agreement between the parties is the contract of construction for a stipulated price contained in Exhibit ""5"" which is akin to a contract for a piece of work defined in the aforequoted article. Both parties having fully performed their reciprocal obligations in accordance with said contract, petitioner is estopped from invoking an entirely different agreement so as to demand additional consideration. Once a contract has been consummated, there is nothing left to be done or to be demanded by the parties thereto. All obligations arising from the contract are extinguished. 


As set by the parties, the consideration for the construction of the Gay Theater building is P600,000.00 Pesos which amount has been fully paid by the private respondent. There is no basis for the petitioner's demand for the payment of P62,378.83 Pesos as commission of ten per cent (10%) of the total cost of construction. The denial of petitioner's claim for said amount is affirmed.




4.	Since the contract between the parties has been established as a contract for a piece of work for a stipulated price the right of the contractor to recover the cost of additional works must be governed by Article 1724 quoted as follows: 


ART. 1724.	The contractor who undertakes to build a structure or any other work for a stipulated price, in conformity with plans and specifications agreed upon with the landowner can neither withdraw from the contract or demand an increase in the price on account of the higher cost of labor or materials, save when there has been a change in the plans and specifications, provided:


(1)	Such change has been authorized by the proprietor in writing; 	and


(2)	The additional price to be paid to the contractor had been determined in writing by both parties. 




This Court has found occasion to expound upon the nature of the requisites prescribed by Article 1724 in the case of San Diego v. Sayson, L-16258, August 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 1175, 1178-1179, which is in point: 




xxx			xxx			xxx


It will be noted that whereas under the old article recovery for additional costs in a construction contract can be had if authorization to make such additions tan be proved, the amendment evidently requires that instead of merely' proving authorization, such authorization must be made in writing. The evident purpose of the amendment is to prevent litigation for additional costs incurred by reason of additions or changes in the original plans. Is this additional requirement of a written authorization, to be considered as a mere extension of the Statute of Frauds, or is it a substantive provision? That the requirement for a written authorization is not merely to prohibit admission or oral testimony against the objection of the adverse party, can be inferred from the fact that the provision is not included among those specified in the Statute of Frauds, Article 1403 of the Civil Code. As it does not appear to have been intended as an extension of the Statute of Frauds, it must have been adopted as a substantive provision or a condition precedent to recovery. 


xxx			xxx			xxx




In addition to the owner's authorization for any change in the plans and specifications, Article 1724 requires that the additional price to be paid for the contractor be likewise reduced in writing. Compliance with the two requisites in Article 1724, a specific provision governing additional works, is a 
condition precedent to recovery 
(San Diego v. Sayson, 
supra
). The absence of one or the other bars the recovery of additional costs. Neither the authority for the changes made nor the additional price to be paid therefor may be proved by any other evidence for purposes of recovery. 


In the case before this Court, the records do not yield any 
written authority
 for the changes made on the plans and specifications of the Gay Theater building. Neither can there be found any 
written agreement on the additional price
 to be paid for said ""extra works."" While the trial court may have found in the instant case that the private respondent admitted his having requested the ""extra works"" done by the contractor (Record an Appeal, p. 66 [C.F.I. Decision]), this does not save the day for the petitioner. The private respondent claims that the contractor agreed to make the additions without additional cost. Expectedly, the petitioner vigorously denies said claim of the private respondent. This is precisely a misunderstanding between parties to a construction agreement which the lawmakers sought to avoid in prescribing the two requisites under Article 1724 (Report of the Code Commission, p. 148). And this case is a perfect example of a tedious litigation which had ensued between the parties as a result of such misunderstanding. Again, this is what the law endeavors to prevent (San Diego v. Sayson, 
supra
). 


In the absence of a written authority by the owner for the changes in the plans and specifications of the building and of a written agreement between the parties on the additional price to be paid to the contractor, as required by Article 1724, the claim for the cost of additional works on the Gay Theater building must be denied. 


WHEREFORE, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its Decision of December 23, 1971 which was upheld in its Resolution of October 18, 1972 dismissing the complaint filed by Weldon Construction Corporation is AFFIRMED. The modification by the Court of Appeals of said Decision in its Resolution of October 18, 1972 which dismissed the defendant's counterclaims is likewise AFFIRMED. Petition DISMISSED for lack of merit. 


SO ORDERED.
