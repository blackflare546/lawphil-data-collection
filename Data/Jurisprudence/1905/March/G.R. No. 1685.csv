G.R. No. 1685            March 13, 1905


THE UNITED STATES,
 complainant-appellee,

vs.


PABLO CORPUS,
 defendant-appellant.


Steve Ganson for appellant.

Office of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee. 


CARSON, 
J.:


The accused in this case was convicted in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan of the crime of 
lesiones graves
 as defined and penalized in No. 3 of article 416 of the Penal Code.


We are of the opinion that the evidence adduced at the trial fully established the guilt of the accused, and that the sentence imposed by the trial court should be affirmed, except in so far as it fixes the term of imprisonment of two years and four months
 presidio correccional 
instead of 
 prision correccional
, as prescribed by the article of the Penal Code under which he was convicted.


With this modification, therefore, the sentence appealed from is confirmed and the costs imposed upon appellant. So ordered.


Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa and Johnson, JJ.,
 concur.
