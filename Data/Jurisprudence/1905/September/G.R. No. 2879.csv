G.R. No. 2879           September 25, 1905


EDWIN CASE,
 plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


THE METROPOLE HOTEL AND RESTAURANT, SOCIEDAD ANONIMA,
 defendant-appellant.


Antonio Sanz for appellant.

Rafael Del-Pan for appellee.


CARSON, 
J.:


This case having come here on appeal, the defendant and appellant moves for a stay of execution of the judgment pending the appeal.


It appears that the trial court denied a similar motion, and we are of opinion that no change has taken place in the status of the parties or of the subject-matter, which would justify our inference to modify or annul the effect of the ruling of the court below.


Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, and Willard, JJ.,
 concur.
