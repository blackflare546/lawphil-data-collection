G.R. No. 2339            May 5, 1905


THE UNITED STATES,
 plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


BALDOMERO RAMOS, ET AL.,
 defendants-appellants.


Fernando de la Cantera for appellants.

Office of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee. 


WILLLARD, 
J.:


This case has heretofore been dismissed by this court so far as the appellant Eusebio Concepcion is concerned. The violent abduction of Maria Josef is fully proved, as is also the participation of the defendants in the act. Those defendants who stayed outside of the house are equally guilty as principals with those who entered. As to Inocencio Sulit Juan the penalty is increased to fourteen years eight months and one day. In all other respects the judgment against the appellants other than Eusebio Concepcion is affirmed, with one-fourth of the costs of this instance against each of them. 


Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson and Carson, JJ.,
 concur.
