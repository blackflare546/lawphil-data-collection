G.R. No. 2246            January 12, 1905


THE UNITED STATES,
 complaint-appellee,

vs.


PEDRO BAILON,
 defendant-appellant.


W. H. Lawrence for appellant.

Office of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee.


JOHNSON, 
J.:


The defendant in this case was charged with the crime of parricide.


The proof shows that on the 1st day of April, 1904, in the pueblo of Licab, of the Province of Nueva Ecija, because of some disagreement existing between the accused and his wife, Paula Rayo, he did strike, beat, and wound said Paula Rayo with a club, from the effects of which wounds the said Paula Rayo died.


The Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija found the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and sentenced him to the penalty of 
cadena perpetua
 with the accessories of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification and to pay the costs. The attorney appointed to represent the defendant in this court joins with the Solicitor-General of the Philippine Islands in recommending that the sentence of said court be affirmed.


Upon examination of the proof the court finds the evidence sufficient to sustain the facts alleged in the complaint, as well as to justify the sentence of the Court of First Instance of said province.


The sentence of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija is therefore affirmed. So ordered.


Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa and Carson, JJ.,
 concur.
