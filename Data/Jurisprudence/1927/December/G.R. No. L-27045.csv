 plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


OLUTANGA LUMBER COMPANY,
 defendant-appellant.


Jose Erquiaga and Carlos A. Sobral for appellant.

Araneta & Zaragoza and Pablo Lorenzo for appellee 				


STATEMENT 


Plaintiff alleges that both plaintiff and defendant are domestic corporation with principal offices in Manila, and that the defendant has branch office at Zamboanga; that the defendant company was formerly indebted to plaintiff, through its branch office, in the sum of more than P85,000, secured by two chattel mortgages executed by the defendant to the plaintiff, one on March 19, 1918, and the other on June 1, 1918; that both of said mortgages have been foreclosed and the property therein described sold at a public auction by the sheriff; that after the foreclosure of the mortgages, the defendant is still indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of P78,765.81, which is now due and owing, for which demand has been made. 


For answer the defendant made a general and specific denial of all of the material allegations of the complaint, and as a special defense alleges that the plaintiff fraudulently and illegally caused the sheriff of Zamboanga in the month of September, 1922, to sell the property described in the mortgages, in a municipality which was neither the residence of the defendant corporation nor the place where the mortgaged property was situated; that the property was sold to the plaintiff by means of fraud; and that before the sale, plaintiff has entered into a secret and fraudulent agreement with Walter A. Smith, as president and general manager of Walter A. Smith Co., Inc., of Iloilo, as evidenced by the following writing:

GENTLEMEN: Confirming our oral agreement in connection with your offer to purchase the properties of the Olutanga Lumber Company now mortgaged to us, we beg to state our understanding of the proposition as follows: 


We will proceed to foreclose our mortgage on the said properties and bid in the same for the amount due on the mortgage. If our bid is successful we will sell the said properties to you for the sum of P88,667.21 plus interest now due, as appears in the books of our Zamboanga Branch, which you agree to pay in the following manner: 


During the first year following the date of said sale you will pay the interest only on the purchase price at the rate of 9 per cent per annum; during the second year you will pay one-third of the said purchase price and interest in equal monthly installments; during the third year you will pay another one-third of the said purchase price and interest in equal monthly installments; the balance of said purchase price with interest, to be paid during the fourth year, in equal monthly installments. As security for the payment of said purchase price and interest you will mortgage to us the properties sold to you and will also mortgage to us the motor schooner 
Mohawk
.


That you will pay to the Bureau of Forestry the fees due by the Olutanga Lumber Company, amounting to about P20,000 inside of four years, pursuant to the oral agreement entered into between the Bureau of Forestry and yourselves. 


It being understood that no payments are to be made during the first year. Payments will be made at the beginning of the second year and made monthly, one-thirty-sixth of the amount due on the straight tax, said payments to extend over a period of three years. 


While the mill is operating we will guarantee the payment of one-thirty-sixth of the past due obligations of the old Olutanga Lumber Company to the Government, less amount realized on guarantee bonds. Our guarantee not to exceed one-thirty-sixth of the balance, or approximately six hundred pesos (P600), in case you fail to make payment. 


That in consideration of the above, the Bureau of Forestry will grant you a timber license for the term of four years covering the same area as the former Olutanga Lumber Corporation. 


If the above is your understanding of the agreement will you confirm the same by signing the duplicate of this letter and returning the same to us. 


Very respectfully,


WILLIAM T. NOLTING
