BARRERA, 
J.:


This is an appeal taken by petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue from the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals (in C.T.A. Case No. 269), holding respondent Cantilan Lumber Company, not liable for the payment of compensating tax on certain machinery and equipment purchased from the U.S. Government by the partnership ""Cantilan Lumber Company"".


The record disclose that on June 17, 1946, the Cantilan Lumber Company, a duly registered partnership composed of Nelson E. Kellogg and Alonso M. Villalba, entered into a contract with the U.S. Government, through the Manila Engineer District (MANED), for the supply by the former to the latter of a minimum of 2,400,000 board feet of timber. To enable the partnership to perform the terms of said contract, the U.S. Government promised to furnish to it the necessary machinery, equipment, and supplies at prices to be agreed upon by both parties.


Pursuant to said contract, the U.S. Government, through the MANED, furnished the partnership, during the 4th quarter of 1946 and the 1st quarter of 1947, various equipment such as sawmill machinery, trucks, power control unit, tractors, arch, generator, welder arc, materials and supplies with a total value of P262,857.78. The Collector, in his letter dated May 31, 1947, demanded from the partnership payment of the sum of P13,142.89, as compensating tax on the aforesaid articles.


Subsequently, the MANED made several other deliveries, thus increasing the value of the articles delivered to P455,078.62. Later, BIR Agent Castor Jongko reported the return by the Lumber company to MANED of certain machinery and equipment, thereby reducing the value to P430,785.28. Based on this last amount, the Collector, in his letter dated September 14, 1954, assessed the amount of P21,539.36 (5% of P430, 785.28), as compensating tax. This demand superseded the original demand dated May 31, 1947.


The original contract (No. W-2557-eng-409) between MANED and the partnership was modified by a supplement agreement dated July 16, 1947, known as Modification No. 1, and by supplemental agreement dated June 25, 1948, known as Modification No. 5. Modification No. 1 described the items delivered by the MANED to the partnership, and provided that payment for all items so delivered would be made by the U.S. Government, with holding any amount which became due the contractor under the contract, until the full price for said items had been paid. It also extended the term of the contract to June 30, 1948. Modification No. 5, on the other hand, made a change in the manner of delivery of the lumber, and extended the term of the original contract to May, 1949.


In the meantime, the partnership (Cantilan Lumber Company) underwent several 36 3 changes. It was dissolved as of August 12, 1948, as per agreement executed on September 30, 1948, by the partners (Kellogg and Villalba), whereby Kellog purchased for P80,000.00, ""all of the participation, share, right, title and interest and whatsoever of him (Villalba)"" ""in the business and good will of the partnership hereby dissolved, and in all and singular the equipment, engines, machinery, whether fixed or movable, tools and accessories, plant, buildings and other improvements, supplies, effects, stocks of logs and lumber, book accounts and other credits, contracts including the above-mentioned contract with the United States Government, and other assets of the partnership."" One of the conditions of the sale was the agreement of Kellogg ""to assume, pay and satisfy all debts as shown by the books of the firm as of the date of dissolution thereof, 
except the income taxes
 accrued to the date of dissolution, which taxes shall be apportioned equally between and paid by both of the parties.""


On October 29, 1948, respondent Cantilan Lumber Company was duly organized and registered as a corporation
1
 ""for the purpose of taking over the entire lumber business previously operated by the aforesaid partnership (Cantilan Lumber Company), together with all the equipment, buildings and other properties or assets appertaining thereto."" As per deed of sale executed by the parties (date December 7, 1948) Kellogg, for and in consideration of the sum of P160,000.00,
2
 sold, assigned, transferred, and conveyed to respondent corporation ""all the lumber business heretofore carried on by the former partnership of Kellogg and Villaba under the name and style of 'Cantilan Lumber Company,' and all and singular the equipment, engines, machinery, whether fixed or movable tools and accessories, plant, buildings and other improvements, supplies, effects, stocks of logs and lumber, book accounts and other assets of said partnership of every nature and description including good-will and trade-name, the said assets being understood as those appearing on the books of account and inventories of said (partnership) because as of the 12th of August, 1948."" One of the conditions of the sale was the agreement by respondents corporation ""to discharge all lawful debts and liabilities of the Vendor (Kellogg) in relation to the said lumber business as shown by the books of the firm as of the date of said transfer (August 12, 1948)."" Kellogg was one of the original directors of respondent corporation, owning 40% of the subscribed capital stock thereof, and its general manager.


As herefore stated, as early as May 31, 1947, petitioner demanded payment of the compensating tax on the aforementioned machinery, equipment, and supplies. However, collection of said tax could not be made as the Cantilan Lumber Company (the partnership as well as the corporation) through its general manager Kellogs interposed the defense that the machinery and equipment were still owned by the U. S. Government.


On September 14, 1954, after a revision of the account, petitioner, in his letter addressed to respondents corporation, again demanded payment of the tax, this time in the increased sum of P21,539.26, in view of additional machineries and equipment delivered to the corporation. Respondent, in its letter addressed to the Bureau of Internal Revenue dated October 21, 1954 and signed by its then general manager, G.W. Bayer, replied that it has not yet obtained title to the property, inasmuch as it was still indebted to the U.S. Government, and requested petitioner to hold the matter in abeyance, until they hear from Washington regarding the claim, in order that they can ascertain the final and actual amount of the compensating tax for which the corporation may be liable.

It appears, however, that title to the machinery and equipment in question was transferred to respondent corporation, when it was already a corporation, on May 11, 1954.


On November 18, 1955, the Deputy Provincial Treasurer of Surigao, acting upon petitioner's instruction, seized the following property of respondent corporation:
