This is an action to compel the mayor of the municipality of Ronda, province of Cebu, to approve and sign the municipal payroll for the period from 16 to 31 January 1956 and subsequent payrolls, and the provincial auditor, the provincial treasurer and the municipal treasurer to pass them in audit, approve and pay the salary of the petitioner as chief of police, and to recover from them actual, moral and exemplary damages in the sum of P5,000.00.

From a judgment dismissing the petition, the petitioner has appealed.


The appointment of the petitioner as chief of police of the municipality of Ronda, province of Cebu, was signed by councilor Toribio Chiong, who on 16 December 1955 took over the office of mayor by designation made by ex-mayor Fortunato Villalon. In the general elections of November 1951, Fortunato Villalon was elected mayor, and the councilor who obtained the highest number of votes among the candidates for councilor was Lucio Ortiz. After Lucio Ortiz the next councilor who received the highest number of votes was Lourdes V. Diama. In the general election of November 1955, Lucio Ortiz ran for municipal mayor of Ronda, was elected, and assumed office on 1 January 1956. Mayor Fortunato Villalon desingated Toribio Chiong as acting mayor during his absence and that of the vice-mayor, bacause Lucio Ortiz, the first councilor could not act as mayor, he having filed a certificate of candidacy for the office of mayor of Ronda. During the incumbency of Toribio Chiong as acting Mayor of Ronda by designation, the petitioner was appointed chief of police. Having been elected to the office of the mayor and after assuming office on 1 January 1956, Lucio Ortiz found that the appointment of the petitioner as chief of police was illegal, so he served upon him notice of termination of his service.


Section 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code provides:


Upon the occasion of the absence, suspension, or other temporary disability of the mayor, his duties shall be discharged by the vice-mayor, or if there be no vice-mayor, by the councilor who at the last general election received the highest number of votes.


The designation by Fortunato Villalon of councilor Toribio Chiong who was the fifth in point of number of votes received in the general elections of 1951 is not as provided in the above quoted section of the Revised Administrative Code. Such being the case, his designation to act as mayor was illegal. Not being a de jure officer he could not appoint the petitioner as chief of police of the municipality of Ronda. In fact the petitioner's appointment as chief of police was neither approved by the Commissioner of CIvil Service nor by the President of the Philippines, as required in paragraph 14, Executive Order No. 175, series of Ť1938, and was withdrawn by the respondent mayor before the Bureau of Civil Service and the Office of the President of the Philippines could act on it, and the appointment of Honorato R. Villafańe, also a civil service eligible, as chief of police of the municipality of Ronda, effective 16 January 1956 was approved.


The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs in both instances.
