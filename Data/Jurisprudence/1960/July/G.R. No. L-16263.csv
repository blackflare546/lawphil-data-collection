CONCEPCION, 
J
.:


This 
quo warranto 
proceeding was initiated on November 25, 1950. The prayer in the petition, as amended on December 1, 1959, reads:




WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered in favor of the petitioners:


ON THE FIRST OF ACTION:


1. Declaring the petitioners as duly qualified for the position of member of the Board of Medical Examiners and that any one of them is legally entitled to be appointed as members of said Board;


2. Declaring the appointment of the respondent Dr. Pedro M. Cruz as members of the Board of Medical Examiners illegal and therefore null and void and ousting him therefrom and perpetually prohibiting him (unless appointed in accordance with law) from exercising the rights and performing the duties and functions connected therewith.


ON THE SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:


1. That pending the hearing on the merits of this case a writ of preliminary injunction be issued forthwith 
ex parte
 ordering the respondent to cease, desist and refrain from assuming the office of member of the Board of Medical Examiners and exercising the rights and performing the duties and functions connected therewith, particularly to give or conduct the next examinations for physicians 
scheduled on or about December 14, 1959
, or to take part in any way in the giving or conducting thereof, and after due hearing to make said injunction permanent;


2. Ordering the respondent to pay the costs of this suit.


Petitioners further pray for such further and other relief as this Honorable Court ""may deem just and proper under the premises.""




By a resolution dated December 3, 1959, this Court denied the petition for a writ of preliminary injunction.


The petitioners are doctors Jose Cuyegkeng, Pedro N. Mayuga, Benjamin Roa, Timoteo Alday, Dominador Jacinto, Alejandro Gaerlan and Rosita Rivera-Ramirez. Their alleged cause of action is predicated upon the fact that their names appear in a list of qualified physicians, approved and submitted, to the President of the Philippines, by the Executive Council of the Philippine Medical Association of the Philippines pursuant to the provisions of section 13 of Republic Act No. 2382, for appointment as members of the Board of Medical Examiners, and that respondent Dr. Pedro M. Cruz, whom the President appointed to said board was not named in said list.


Soon after the institution of this case, the officers and members of said Council of the Philippine Medical Association, which is said to be an incorporated association of the medical profession in the Philippines, were allowed to intervene and then filed a petition in intervention, joining the petitioners in praying for the relief sought by them.


It appears that, on October 16, 1959, said Council, acting in conformity with section 13 of Republic Act No. 2382, otherwise known as The Medical Act of 1959, approved and submitted to the President a revised list of qualified physicians, including petitioners herein, for appointment to the aforementioned Board. The letter of said Council transmitting the aforementioned list reads as follows:
