REYES, J.B.L., 
J.:


From the judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals (in CTA Case No. 74) reversing his decision of January 27, 1955, which holds respondent Jose Cojuangco liable for deficiency sales taxes, petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue interposed the present petition for review.


The case was submitted for decision of the Tax court on the basis of a ""Stipulation of Facts"" which incorporated, as annexes, certain records of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The material facts may be briefly stated as follows:


At a public bidding held by the Surplus Property Commission on April 22, 1948, Fernando Villa-Abrille was the successful bidder for the purchase of all movable goods (except some items specified) found at CMD-3 Area, Samar Naval Base, Guiuan, Samar, priced at P94,500.00. The award of the bid was duly approved by the Government Enterprise Control Committee, and its terms and conditions were set forth in SPC-Invoice No. 7770, dated May 28, 1948 (Annex D). Villa-Abrille deposited the amount of P10,000 under Manager's Check No. 13040 (Philippine Bank of Commerce) to cover the required deposit of 5% of the purchase price, for which Official Receipt No. 689017, dated April 22, 1948, (Annex A), was issued. Not having the necessary funds to cover the balance of the purchase price, the 5% compensating tax and the necessary expenses for labor and materials for the reconditioning of said goods for use or sale, he invited Cojuangco to provide said funds. The latter accepted the offer and on May 28, 1948, he and Villa-Abrille entered into an agreement (Annex B), which reads:

After the above agreement was signed by respondent and Villa- Abrille, the latter paid to the Surplus Property Commission the unpaid balance of the purchase price of the surplus goods in the amount of P84,400.00 which includes the compensating tax in the amount of P4,500.00, payment thereof being evidenced by Official Receipt No. A-690575 dated May 28, 1948 (Annex B), issued in the name of Villa-Abrille. Accordingly, SPC-Invoice No. 7770 (Annex C) was issued in the name of Villa-Abrille, to cover the sale in question.


Subsequently, Villa-Abrille sold a portion of the surplus goods to Hume Pipe and Asbestos Co. on August 11, 1949, and the rest to Ellin and Co. on February 2, 1951 and may 28, 1952. In accordance with the provision of Paragraph 12 of the aforequoted agreement, Villa-Abrille deposited with the Philippine Bank of Commerce the amount of P145,000.00 under Special Account and/or Trust Account, in the name of Fernando F. de Villa-Abrille and/or Jose Cojuangco, and/or Demetria S. Cojuangco. Due to the deficiency tax assessment (to be described later) made by the petitioner on respondent, the amount of P37, 531.38 was, on June 7, 1955, segregated from said account, and deposited in the name of petitioner, the disposition of which was made dependent on the final decision of the case.
