COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS,

GUTIERREZ JR., 
J.:


This is a petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Tax Appeal's decision denying the petitioner's claim for the refund of P1,317,801.03, representing Money market transaction taxes which the petitioner paid from June 3, 1977 to August 5, 1977, and the resolution denying its motion for reconsideration.


Petitioner is a domestic corporation engaged in mining, particularly copper concentrates for export mined from mineral lands in Atok and Kibungan, Benguet.


In October 1972, upon application for tax exemption filed with the Bureau of Mines, the petitioner was granted Certificate of Qualification for Tax Exemption No. 34.


On December 24, 1976, the petitioner was also granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Certificate of Renewal No. R-1056, authority to borrow money and issue commercial papers. Pursuant to this authority, the petitioner borrowed funds from several financial institutions from June, 1977 to October 1977 and paid the corresponding 35% transaction tax due thereon in the amount of P1,317,801.03, The tax was paid pursuant to Section 210 (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977.


On February 16, 1978, the petitioner applied for the refund of the P1,317,801.03 alleging that it was not liable to pay the 35% transaction tax under its Certificate of Qualification for Tax Exemption No. 34 issued by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and pursuant to Section 79-A of Commonwealth Act No. 137, otherwise known as The Mining Act and Presidential Decree No. 463, the Mineral Resources Development Decree of 1974, as implemented by Consolidated Mines Administrative Order of the Secretary of Natural Resources dated May 17, 1974.


On February 19, 1979, the respondent Commissioner of internal Revenue denied the petitioner's claim for refund.


On May 29, 1979, the petitioner filed a petition for review with the respondent Court of Tax Appeals. On August 28, 1979, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue filed his answer alleging inter alia that:




xxx 			xxx			 xxx


(a)	The 35% transaction tax is actually a tax on the interest earnings of the lender who is actually the taxpayer on whose income, the tax is imposed;


(b)	Petitioner did not pay the 35"", transaction tax in its own behalf, as this liability has been fully shifted to and paid for the account of the lender:


(c)	Petitioner merely acted as withholding agent in paying


(d)	the 35% transaction tax based on the gross interest income of the 


(e)	lender;


(d)	Petitioner's exemption from taxes granted under Sections 52 and 53 of Presidential Decree No. 463 relates to importations of machineries, tools and equipment to be used in the mining operations and taxes on mining claims, improvement thereon and mineral products, whereas the 35% transaction tax is levied on transactions pertaining to commercial papers issued in the primary money market as principal instruments; in other words, Sections 52 and 53 of P.D. 463 do not apply to this case of petitioner. 




After due hearing but before the respondent court could render its decision, the petitioner filed a pleading entitled ""Request for Judicial Notice and Request for Admission"" alleging that the subject tax was paid in the nature of a business tax, that petitioner's claim for refund is based on its exemption from business taxes, and that its exemption is protected by existing tax exemptions granted it under the mining law.


On January 29, 1982, the respondent court denied the petitioner's ""Request for Judicial Notice and Request for Admission. ""


On May 21, 1982, the respondent court rendered its decision dismissing the petition for review for lack of merit.


The petitioner raised the following assignments of errors:


Assignment of error No. 1

No. 1739) WHICH RECOGNIZES PETITIONER'S RIGHT OF RELIEF AGAINST THE TRANSACTION TAX (SEE PEOPLE VS. PURISIMA, I,-42050-66; NOV. 20,1978; 86 SCRA 542).




The errors raised by the petitioner are grounded on one main issue, whether or not the petitioner is exempt from the 35% transaction tax.


We find the alleged errors without merit.

xxx			xxx			xxx




All mining claims, improvements thereon and mineral products derived therefrom shall likewise be exempt from the payment of all taxes, except income tax, for the same period provided for in the first paragraph of this section.




xxx			xxx			xxx




The statutory provisions on tax exemptions clearly exclude the 35% transaction tax.


Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 237 on Compensating Tax, Section I of P.D. No. 238 on Conditionally Free Importations, and Section 53 of P.D. No. 463 all refer to tax exemptions for importations of machineries, tools for production, plants to convert mineral ores into saleable form, spare parts, supplies, materials, accessories, explosives, chemicals and transportation and communication facilities, to be used in mining operations. Section 53 of P.D. No. 463 likewise refers to tax exemptions for mining claims and improvements thereon, and mineral products, except income tax. The petitioner's Certificate of Qualification for Tax Exemption No. 34 exempts ""... from payment of all taxes except income tax, payable by him in the conduct of his business and in the importation of machineries, spare parts and or equipment listed in the stamped ""Annex I "" which are considered to be indispensable in the operation and will be used by said operator lessee exclusively in the mineral land mentioned above.


Clearly, the transaction tax of P1,317,801.03 paid by the petitioner was not actually imposed upon it in the conduct of its mining business or in the importation of machinery, spare parts and or equipment listed in the stamped ""ANNEX I"" of its certificate of qualification for tax exemption and which are indespensable in the operation and used exclusively on petitioner's mineral land.


Petitioner submits that inasmuch as taxes in general constitute allowable deductions from gross income in the determination of taxable net income, the 35% transaction tax is a business tax and not an income tax because the Revenue Code itself classifies it as ""Business Tax"" under Title V, and that P. D. No. 1154 expressly states that the transaction tax shall be allowed as a deductible item for purposes of determining the borrower's taxable income.


The petitioner's contentions deserve scant consideration, The 35%, transaction tax is imposed on interest income from commercial papers issued in the primary money market. Being a tax on interest, it is a tax on income.


As correctly ruled by the respondent Court of Tax Appeals:




Accordingly, we need not and do not think it necessary to discuss further the nature of the transaction tax more than to say that the incipient scheme in the issuance of Letter of Instructions No. 340 on November 24, 1975 (O.G. Dec. 15, 1975), i.e., to achieve operational simplicity and effective administration in capturing the interest-income 'windfall' from money market operations as a new source of revenue has lost none of its animating principle in parturition of amendatory Presidential decree No. 1154, now Section 210(b) of the Tax Code. The tax thus imposed is actually a tax on interest earrings of the lenders or placers who are actually the taxpayer,, in whose income is imposed. Thus, ""the borrower withholds the tax of 35% from the interest he would have to pay the lender so that he (borrower) can pay the 35% of the interest to the Government."" (President Marcos, Times Journal, June 17, 1977 cited in Respondent's Memorandum p. 6) ... Suffice it to state that the broad concensus of fiscal and monetary authorities is that ""even if nominally, the borrower is made to pay the tax, actually the tax is on the interest earning of the immediate and an prior lenders/placers of the money ... (Rollo, pp. 36-37)




The 35% transaction tax is an income tax on interest earnings to the lenders or placers The latter are actually the taxpayers. Therefore, the tax cannot be a tax imposed upon petitioner. In other words, the petitioner who borrowed funds from several financial institutions by issuing commercial papers merely withheld the 35% transaction tax before paying to the financial institutions the interests earned by them and later remitted the same to the respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The tax could have been collected by a different procedure but the statute chose this method. Whatever collecting procedure is adopted does not change the nature of the tax.


Furthermore, whether or not certain taxes are on income is not necessarily determined by their deductibility or non-deductibility from gross income. As correctly observed by the Solicitor General, income in the form of dividends, capital gains on real property pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg, 37, shares of stock pursuant to Presidential Decree 1739, and interests on savings in bank accounts, for instance, are incomes, yet they are not includible in the gross income when income taxes are paid because these are subject to final withholding taxes.


The petitioner also submits that the 35% transaction tax is a business tax because it is imposed under Title V, entitled -,Taxes on Business"" and classified specially under Chapter II, entitled ""Tax on Business.""


The location of the 35%, tax in the Tax Code does not necessarily determine its nature, Again, we agree with the Solicitor General that the legislative body must have realized later that. the subject tax was inappropriately included among the taxes on business because Section 210 of the Tax Code has been repealed by Presidential Decree No. 1739, which now imposes a tax of 20% on interests from deposits and yields from deposit substitutes such as commercial papers issued in the primary market as principal instrument and provides for them in Section 24(cc) under Chapter III, Tax on Corporations, Title II-Income. Tax.


Petitioner Western Minolco Corporation has failed to justify its claimed exemption from the 35,7c, transaction tax. The decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue denying the petitioner's claim for refund is affirmed. It bears repeating that the law looks with disfavor on tax exemptions and he who would seek to be thus privileged must justify it by words too plain to be mistaken and too categorical to be misinterpreted.


(Commissioner of Internal Revenue U. P. J Kiener Company Ltd, International Construction Corporation et al., L,-24754, July 18, 1975, 65 SCRA 142).


WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The decision of the respondent Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED: In 
toto.
