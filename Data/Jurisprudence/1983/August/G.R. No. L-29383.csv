G.R. No. L-29383	August 17, 1983


THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, 
plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


AMADO CHANCOCO, and JOAQUIN CHANCOCO 
defendants-appellants.
 




RELOVA, 
J.:


Appellants Amado Chancoco and Joaquin Chancoco father and son, together with Dioscoro Carimpong, Pedro Naui Daniel Hermosa and Rosendo Obosa were charged before the Court of First Instance of Nueva Vizcaya with the crime of Robbery with Homicide as defined and penalized in Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code. Before the arraignment, and over the opposition of the other defendants, thru counsel, Daniel Hermosa was discharged so that he could be utilized as state witness.


Upon arrangement, the rest of the defendants pleaded not guilty. After the trial, the lower court rendered its decision, the dispositive part of which reads:


IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, and finding the accused Amado Chancoco, Joaquin Chancoco, Dioscoro Carimpong and Pedro Naui guilty beyond reasonable doubt of thecrime of homicide without the attendance of any qualifying circumstance, the Court hereby sentences each one of them to suffer an indeterminate penalty ranging from EIGHT (8) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of 
prison mayor
 as minimum to SIXTEEN (16) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of 
reclusion temporal
 as maximum, with the accessory penalties of the law, each to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased Uy Dit in the amount of P5,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay one-sixth (1/6) of the costs of the proceedings.






The accused Captain Rosenio Oboza is hereby acquitted of the charge against him in the information.


The accused Dioscoro Carimpong and Pedro Naui are hereby credited with one-half of the time they have undergone preventive imprisonment. (pp. 20-2 1, Rollo)






From the above decision, the accused Dioscoro Carimpong and Pedro Naui did not appeal. Amado Chancoco, and Joaquin Chancoco, appealed to the Court of Appeals, assigning the following errors:






1.	The trial court erred in allowing the discharge of accused Daniel Hermosa to become a state witness over and above objections of counsels of the other accused.


2.	The trial court erred in giving value and credence to the testimony of discharged accused Daniel Hermosa as state witness even after it has totally discredited the testimony of prosecution witness Feliza Gutierrez Vda. de Ostaris.


3.	The trial court erred in declaring that the crime committed was that of Homicide alone; that it was proven beyond reasonable double as against the herein appellants together with their co-accused Dioscoro Carimpong and Pedro Naui meting out to each of them the penalty embodied in the decision, Annex ""A"" thereof. (pp. 1-2, Appellants' Brief)






From the evidence on record, We find the facts stated in the People's Brief to have been duly established, to wit:






Appellants do not dispute the fact that Uy Dit, for whose death they were charged with robbery with homicide, was in the afternoon of November 24, 1958 really found dead in his own ""bodega"" in Aritao Nueva Vizcaya (Appellants Brief, p. 2) Dr. Carlina V. Naldo who as municipal health officer of Aritao was called upon by the police to examine the cadaver, declared on the witness stand that when she saw the cadaver of Uy Dit, at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon of November 24, 1958, its state of 
rigor mortis
 indicated the time of death as around 15 or 17 hours previously, or sometime between 12 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon (tsn, p. 25).


She further declared that when she first saw the cadaver, there were three sacks of rice on it, one over the head and two over the body (tsn p, 26).


The day after, the doctor set down her findings as follows:


AUTOPSY REPORT

Causes of Death: Hemorrhage and shock due to fracture of the base of the skull and asphyxia due to strangulation and heavy pressure on the head and body (Exh. 'C', Record, p. 7)










Discharged defendant Daniel Hermosa narrated how the luckless Uy Dit, was killed by the accused for the money that Uy Dit, hid in his ""bodega."" Having picked up Hermosa from a circus he was watching in the town of Aritao late in the night of November 23, 1958, Joaquin Chancoco, and Dioscoro Carimpong set up Hermosa as look out outside Uy Dits 'bodega' by the national highway, where Hermosa was presently joined by accused Pedro Naui (tsn, pp. 155-158). Hermosa saw Joaquin Chancoco, open the door of the ""bodega"" with a key, walk inside, and knock three times on the wall of the ""bodega"" adjoining Amado Chancoco's residence. Soon, as on signal, Amado Chancoco, arrived at the scene with two other men (tsn, pp. 157-159, 161).






These three men now, together with Joaquin Chancoco, and Dioscoro Carimpong started looking around the 'bodega' until Amado Chancoco, came upon a pile of money under the flooring of the 'camalig' just where the sacks of palay were stacked (tsn, pp. 161-163, 196).


Long before Uy Dit, in the company of Feliza Gutierrez, came upon the accused in the 'bodega.' On the instant, Amado Chancoco pulled Uy Dit, towards him and struck Uy Dit, a fistblow in the face, while Dioscoro Carimpong hit Uy Dit, in the shin with a club. Someone handed a gun over to Amado Chancoco with which he struck Uy Dit, on the head. All this time the surprised Uy Dit, was exclaiming: 'Compadre (Amado Chancoco why do you strike me?' (tsn, pp. 163-167)


When Uy Dit, lay prostrate on the floor, Amado Chancoco pulled out a key from one of the victim's pockets and with it opened the door of the small office within the 'bodega' (tsn., pp. 168-169). Feliza Gutierrez, with whom Uy Dit, came upon the accused in the 'bodega', supplied the fact that Amado Chancoco was able to find more of Uy Dits money inside the little office (tsn, pp. 228-229).


""Before the accused left the ""bodega"", Joaquin Chancoco and Dioscoro Carimpong placed three cavans of palay on the dead or dying body of Uy Dit, (tsn, p. 177). (pp. 2-5, People's Brief)






The Court of Appeals, in a resolution dated July 16, 1968, said that the crime committed by the appellants and their coaccused is not simple homicide but robbery with homicide, as defined and penalized in Article 294, paragraph I of the Revised Penal Code, which reads:






ART. 294. 
Robbery with Violence against or intimidation of persons-- Penalties. â€”
 Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against, or intimidation of any person shall suffer:


1.	The penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed, ...






and, pursuant to Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, forwarded the records to Us for final determination of the appeal, 


The victim Uy Dit, was killed ""by reason or on the occasion of robbery."" On this point, defendant-turned state witness-Daniel Hermosa, whose testimony appeared to be absolutely necessary, declared that before Uy Dit, arrived at the bodega where he was killed, the accused came upon a pile of money that then were looking for uinder the floor where the sacks of palay were stacked. Hereunder is the testimony of Daniel Hermosa:

Q	Why were you able to recognize the P5.00 and P10.00 bills 


A	Because I was near, sir. (tsn., pp. 227-229, Dec. 21, 1962 hearing)










It is clear that the crime of robbery, by reason or on the occasion on which Uy Dit, was killed has been established by evidence.


Against the People's evidence, appellants put up the defense of alibi. Amado Chancoco and Joaquin Chancoco declared that in the morning of November 23, 1958 they were in the barrio of Kirang, Aritao Nueva Vizcaya, which is about one kilometer from the town proper of Aritao They, together with tenant Launario Campos, were busy in the harvesting of peanuts the whole day and the whole night until 3:00 in the following morning. It was between 3:30 and 4:00 in the afternoon of November 24, 1958 when they received news that his (Amado) compadre Uy Dit, was killed. Thereafter, they returned to their house at the poblacion.


Well settled is the rule that alibi has no weight against the positive Identification of the culprit. State witness Daniel Hermosa has Identified and pointed to appellants Amado Chancoco and Joaquin Chancoco as well as to the accused Dioscoro Carimpong and Pedro Naui as the persons who took direct participation in the crime in which the deceased Uy Dit, was the victim. On the basis of the evidence on record, appellants Amado Chancoco and Joaquin Chancoco are guilty of robbery with homicide as charged in the information against them.


WHEREFORE, the judgment of conviction on appellants Amado Chancoco and Joaquin Chancoco is hereby AFFIRMED but modified in the sense that they are guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide and sentenced to suffer 
reclusion perpetua
.


SOORDERED.
