SO ORDERED. (pp. 10-11, Rollo)






Petitioners filed separate motions for was, which, however, were denied. Hence, the present petitioners alleging that respondent Sandiganbayan committed reversible errors in convicting petitioners Peñaverde and Hermita of the cranes charged and presenting for resolution the following issues: 


(1)	Whether or not serious doubts exist as to the probability of the commission of the offenses imputed to herein petitioners.


(2)	Whether or not there is conspiracy between petitioner Peñaflor Peñaverde and his co-accused Melecio C. Hermits to commit the offenses.


Anent the first issue, petitioners contend that Peñaflor V. Peñaverde as Barangay Captain of Manapao Minalabac Camarines Sur, is not an accountable officer; that the BIDA finds in the amount of P5,000.00 to which Barangay Manapao is entitled was not entrusted to his custody but to the custody and control of Provincial Development Officer Adolfo Badiola, who issued the checks for the purchase of construction materials and for the cost of labor; and that since Badiola is the accountable officer and not petitioner Peñaverde he (Peñaverde) cannot therefore be guilty of the crane of malversation of public funds. Further, they argue that assuming, without admitting, that there was malversation of public funds, the taking of the amount from the P5,000.00 in three (3) different occasions constitutes one (1) crime only.


In his comment to instant petitions, the Solicitor General admits that petitioners may not be convicted of malversation because they were not accountable officers. Adolfo Badiola, the Provincial Development Officer, admitted that he has been the accountable officer for the BIDA funds.










Q 	Do I understand Mr. Badiola that you were the one who issued these Exhibits A and A-1, these checks? 


A 	Yes, sir. 


Q 	You were the one who issued these checks because you were the one in charge of disbursing this amount of P5,000.00 BIDA finds in your capacity as Provincial Development Officer? 


A 	Yes, sir. 


Q 	And you are the accountable officer insofar as that fund is concerned? 


A 	Yes, sir. (tsn. p. 28, May 14, 1981)










However, the Solicitor General alleged that in Criminal Cases Nos. 2136 and 2138 petitioners conspired to induce Rito Sultan, the owner of the Sulu Hardware which was granted the award for materials, to part with the remaining balance of P4,500.00, in the amount of P300.00 and P1,897.00, on two (2) different occasions on the pretext that the said amount was for the repair of the school. After receiving the balance, they misappropriated it. Thus, they were properly charged in two separate guilty of Estafa a lesser offense (Delfin vs. Court of Appeals, 13 SCRA 366). 


Again, in Criminal Case No. 2137, petitioners conspired to induce Municipal Development Officer Filomeno Olano to give them a check for P500.00, the amount allegedly awarded for labor, by misrepresenting through a picture that the footpath project was already completed. They eventually encashed the check and misappropriated it, for the third occasion, to the damage of the government. 


With respect to the allegation that there was error on the part of respondent Sandiganbayan in concluding that petitioners conspired in the commission of the offense, suffice it to say that the basis of its finding was the credibility of witnesses. Pursuant to Section 7 of Presidential Decree No. 1606, in relation to Section 2, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the findings of fact of the Sandiganbayan are entitled to great respect and only questions of laws may be raised to the Supreme Court. Besides, well settled is the rule that the findings of trial court on credibility of witnesses win not be disturbed unless such findings overlook certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, might affect results of case. 


In Criminal Cases Nos. 2136, 2137 and 2138, We find that the crimes committed by the herein petitioners are estafa, not malversation as charged in the information.


WHEREFORE, the conviction of petitioners by respondent Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 2135 is hereby AFFIRMED. However, in Criminal Cases Nos. 2136,2137 and 2138, petitioners Peñaflor Peñaverde and Melecio C. Hermits are guilty of estafa and each is sentenced as follows:


1.	In Criminal Case No. 2136 - one(1)month and one(1) day of arrests mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) day of prision correccional as maximum;


2.	In Criminal Case No. 2137 - one (1) month and one (1) day of arrests mayor, as minimum to one (1) year and one (1) day of prision correccional as maximum; and 


3.	In Criminal Case No. 2138 - one (1) month and one (1) day of arrests mayor, as minimum to one (1) year and one (1) day of prision correccional, as


SO ORDERED.
