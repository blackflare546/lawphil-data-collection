GUERRERO, J
.:p


On December 4, 1970, at about 12:00 noon, on the occasion of a student demonstration being held in the vicinity of Feati University in Sta. Cruz district, Manila, tragedy struck unexpectedly. Francis Santillano, a 16-year old student of the Philippine Science High School, along with Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad, and Eleuterio Gutierrez, also students of the same school, were hit by a pillbox bomb causing the instantaneous death of Santillano and physical injuries to the others. 


On December 14, 1970, an indictment for ""Murder with Multiple Attempted Murder"" was filed with the Circuit Criminal Court of Manila against Arcadio de la Rosa y Landicho, a security guard of Feati University, charging: 


That on or about December 4, 1970, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with intent to kill, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously treacherously threw a pillbox bomb at the student demonstrators who were then marching along Helios Street, in the Southside of Paterno Bldg., Feati University, in said City, resulting in an explosion, which act was so sudden and unexpected, and without giving a chance to the people gathered therein to defend themselves, and as a consequence thereof, it hit one Francis Santillano who sustained mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death thereafter; that as a further consequence of said explosion, the following persons were hit, to wit: Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad and Eleuterio Gutierrez, who likewise sustained physical injuries, but the said accused did not perform all the acts of execution which should have produced the crime of multiple murder as a consequence, by reason of causes other than his own spontaneous desistance, that is the injuries sustained by said Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad and Eleuterio Gutierrez were not necessarily mortal. 


An extensive and speedy trial was conducted. As the People's Brief has adopted as its ""own appellant's statement of the case and of the facts that are pertinent to the prosecution, the same being substantially correct,"" We quote hereunder the evidence of the prosecution and the defense as recited in the latter's Brief, thus:

""M"").

Doon po katapat na building na bukas ang mga bintana ay mayroon ding mga taong mambabato doon sa mga estudiante sa ibaba"" (pp. 21, 22, supra; Exh. ""5-C""); that he cannot remember how many were the persons at the FEATI building (p. 26, supra); that students were throwing stones towards the upper portion of Paterno building and bottles and stones were coming from said building (pp. 27, 28, supra); that he was standing about 5 meters (per demonstration of witness) from a lamp post towards Plaza Goiti (p. 29, supra); that before leaving the place people converged around the area with some of them in khaki, but he was not sure whether there were policemen (pp. 30, 31, supra); that when confronted with his statement in Exh. ""5"", re Q-29 that ""Matagal-tagal pa po bago nilapitan ng mga tao. Nang mayroon ng dumating na Pulisya at iba pang mga tao at doon din mismo sa tulay ay marami ng nanonood, ako po ay umalis na,"" he was constrained to admit there were policemen who arrived at the scene of the incident where a person laid sprawl on the ground (p. 32, supra); that it did not occur to him to tell the policemen what he saw because there were many other eye-witnesses although he did not see anybody volunteering the information to the police (pp. 32, 33, supra); that he read the Taliba issue of December 5, 1970 which reads: 'Iniutos ni Major Castillo kay Capt. Francisco Adolfo ang paggawa ng masugid na pagsisiyasat upang malaman kung sino ang naghagis ng 'pillbox' mula sa gusali ng Feati' (Exh. ""6-A"") which clearly showed that nobody has been suspected yet, still he (witness) did not report to the police (pp. 35-37, supra); that it was only when he found out that the suspect did not admit his guilt that he decided to go to the police (p. 36, supra); that he used to be a prison guard of the Bureau of Prisons and was exonerated of the administrative charge of maltreatment of prisoners (p. 39, supra); that as a fireman of the Manila Fire Department he was separated from the service because he was sickly for having exceeded his absence (p. 39, supra); that when he reported to the police, he was asked to demonstrate how the person threw the object he previously described as ""maputi-puti"" which he later described as ""maitim"" (pp. 40, 41, supra); and that when he was being in. investigated on December 6, 1970, he was not asked to demonstrate how the person threw the object (p. 41, supra). 


At this Juncture, the defense petitioned for an ocular inspection of the place of the incident and the same was granted. At the McArthur bridge, on the right side going to Sta. Cruz, witness pointed to the lamp post of McArthur bridge where he testified to in court as the place where he was alledly standing on December 4, 1970 (p. 45, supra). Five (5) meters from said lamp post towards Plaza Goiti where Yambao said he was at the time of incident was measured and from that place the window of the FEATI building from where the accused allegedly threw a pillbox could not be seen as the view is obstructed by the Paterno building (p. 50, supra). Noticing the Physical impossibility of seeing the window of FEATI building, witness moved in the opposite direction to about 5 meters away from the lamp post towards Plaza Lawton and pointed to it as the place where he was standing (p. 47, supra). From this newly pointed position, the distance to the place pointed to where Sontillano fell is about 15 meters directly oblique if facing directly the side of the bridge and about 50 meters to the first window of the second floor of the FEATI building where the accused was allegedly seen (pp. 47, 48, supra). On the electric post near the FEATI building are 2 big cable wires and 6 transformers of about 4"" by 6"" (p. 48, supra). 


From McArthur bridge the parties went to Hellos St. at the side of McArthur bridge. Yambao pointed to the place where he claimed Sontillano fell which was 41 feet from the side of McArthur bridge and 13 feet from the wall of Paterno building (pp. 51, 52, supra). The actual measurement by the police investigators at the scene of crime immediately after the incident —16 feet from the side of McArthur bridge and 6 feet from the wall of the Paterno building was also plotted on the ground (pp. 52, 53, supra). The place indicated by Yambao grossly differed from that officially reported by the police by as much as 25 feet from the side of McArthur bridge and 7 feet from the wall of the Paterno building (p. 53, supra). From the spot where the victim fell per the police report, the window at the FEATI building pointed to by the witness as the place where the accused was could not be seen (p. 53, supra). Yambao said that he cannot tell the position of the body (p. 54, supra). 


The parties then proceeded to the first window of the second floor of the FEATI building where the Honorable Presiding Judge threw (3) stones towards McArthur bridge with the first stone hitting the window of Paterno building, the second stone about 8 meters short of the spot where victim allegedly fell according to Yambao and the third stone hitting a car parked in front of the Paterno building and short by 5 meters from the spot pointed to by Yambao (pp. 55, 56, supra). From the first open window of the second floor of the FEATI building, the place on the bridge where Yambao previously testified to in court as the spot he was standing (5 meters from lamp post towards Plaza Goiti could not be seen although the place Yambao subsequently pointed to when he was already on the scene of the incident could be seen (p. 60, supra). 


On re-direct examination, Yambao said that when he saw the accused throwing the object there were no other persons (p. 61, supra).

SO ORDERED. 


Manila, Philippines, February 13, 1971. 


				(SGD.) MANUEL R. PAMARAN 


Judge


From the above decision, accused-appellant appealed raising five assignments of errors: 


I


The lower Court erred in not finding that it is physically impossible for Francis Sontillano to have been hit by a pillbox allegedly thrown from the first open window of the second floor of the Feati Building. 


II 


The lower Court erred in not disregarding the clearly and obviously fabricated testimony of principal prosecution witness Jose B. Yambao. 


III


The lower Court erred in not finding that the alleged confession of defendant-appellant Arcadio de la Rosa is involuntary and as such inadmissible. 


IV 


The lower Court erred in not upholding the testimony of defendant- appellant Arcadio de la Rosa that he was not at the scene of the incident and could not have therefore committed the offense. 


V


The lower Court erred in not acquitting defendant-appellant Arcadio de la Rosa at least on the ground of reasonable doubt. 


Reviewing the defense of accused-appellant, We find that the following salient facts proved by the prosecution evidence are not disputed: (1) The findings of Dr. Luis Larion in his postmortem Report that Francis Sontillano suffered, among others, lacerated wounds, extensive and abulsing with powder bums and singeing of the hair located at the vortex of the head with multiple fractures of the skull and maceration of the brain, that the top of the head was blasted down; and that the cause of death was shock and hemorrhage due to explosive blast injuries of the head, fracturing the skull and macerating the brain (t.s.n., pp. 46-55, Larion January 7, 1971, A.M., Exh. ""M""); (2) The results of the examination and treatment by Dr. Rodolfo Pineda and Dr. Rodolfo Valera of victims Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad and Eleuterio Gutierrez as indicated in the medical certificates marked as Exhibits ""F"", ""G"" and ""H"", respectively (t.s.n., pp. 109-113. Pineda and Valera, January 5, 1971, P.M.); (3) The testimony of police investigator Jesus Patajo that he found the ""pieces of CW nails, which he received for chemistry examination, positive for Nitrates and Nitrites which are probably caused by residues as a result of an explosion (t.s.n., pp. 9-18, Patajo, January 5, 1971, A.M., Exhs. ""A"" & ""A-1""); and (4) The supposed testimony of Captain Raymundo Paredes which was dispensed with in view of the admission that a pillbox could have caused injuries like those suffered by Sontillano. 


The crucial question to be resolved herein is whether or not the evidence against accused Arcadio dela Rosa as the pillbox bomb thrower is so positive and certain as to meet the inflexible requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt. 


The theory of the prosecution is that the accused-appellant, standing at the first open window of the second floor of the Feati building, threw a pillbox towards McArthur bridge which hit a group of students marching along Hellos Street, between Paterno building and Pasig River. In support of this theory, the prosecution relies on the testimony of the alleged witness, Jose Borbon Yambao, and on the alleged voluntary confession of the accused. 


On the other hand, the position of the defense is that the above theory of the prosecution is a physical impossibility; that the accused was not at the Feati University at the time of the incident; that the claim of the police investigators that the accused voluntarily executed his confession is a blatant and calous lie and that Yambao is a last- minute fabricated witness who was recruited to repair the damage caused by the accused's repudiation of the alleged confession, and that therefore, the accused is entitled to an acquittal. 


On the alleged physical impossibility for the victim Francis Sontillano to have been hit by a pillbox allegedly thrown from the first open window of the second floor of the Feati building which accused-appellant contends and submits as the first assigned error on the part of the lower court in not so finding, We find that indeed, the evidence on records shows that the spot where Sontillano fell is disputed. From the report of Pat. Querimit (last paragraph, p. 2, Exh. 2, p. 66, Records) Sontillano fell on that portion of Hellos Street between Paterno Building and Pasig River which is approximately six (6) feet from the south wall of the Paterno Building and about sixteen feet from the east wall of the north approach of the McArthur Bridge. But as pointed out by prosecution witness Jose Yambao (pp. 51-52, t.s.n. Jan. 7, 1971, P.M., Perez) it is that place thirteen feet from the south wall of Paterno Building and forty one (41) feet from the east wall of McArthur bridge. The trial court adopted the latter place as the spot where the victim, Francis Sontillano, fell. 


In arriving at this conclusion, the court cited the ocular inspection of the premises, the observation of the Presiding Judge and his participation therein, among others, as the basis of said conclusion, in the following excerpts: 


... accused claimed that it was physically impossible for the object to be hurled at the first window of the second floor of the Feati Building to the spot where Sontillano felt because of the obstruction of the object hurled by a portion of the Paterno Building which is separated from the Feati Building by Hellos Street. That defense, however, of the accused has no merit. From the common exhibit of the prosecution and the defense (Exhibit ""3""), it is clear that if a straight line is drawn from the place where the accused threw the pillbox (Exhibit ""C"") to the place where Sontillano fell (Exhibit ""2-C ""), that portion of the Paterno Building will not obstruct the pillbox thrown. In the ocular inspection, the court has likewise observed that an object thrown, from the place where the accused was (Exhibit ""C"") to the place where the victim fell (Exhibit ""3-C""), will not be obstructed by that portion of the Paterno Building, the post, the wires and the transformers especially the light of the testimony of Yambao that when accused threw the pillbox, accused made an upward swing of his hand from the left to the right. The Presiding Judge even got stones and threw them upward passing over the wires and transformers and though the third throw fell short of about five meters from the place where the victim fell, yet, it is clear that with the necessary strength of the thrower, it will reach the place where the victim fell without any obstruction. (Decision, pp. 255-256, original records). 


We agree with the trial court that the testimony of Jose Yambao who witnessed the incident when it happened is more reliable than the report of Pat. Querimit (Exh. ""2"") who went to the scene to investigate when it was already 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon some three hours after the incident which occurred at about 12:00 o'clock noon of December 4, 1970 as well as the testimony of Evening News photographer Luciano Caliwan who arrived at the scene an hour after the incident. Both Patrolman Querimit and photographer Caliwan were not present when the explosion occurred and neither did they see Francis Sontillano as he lay sprawled on the road after the explosion. At most, the report of the patrolman and the testimony of the photographer indicated an estimated measurement of what they thought to be the spot where the victim fell. 


The insistence of the defense that the physical impossibility for a pillbox thrown from the first open window of the second floor of Feati Building to have hit Sontillano at the place claimed by the defense and the strong probability that the pillbox came from the top of the Paterno Building is shown by the claim of witness Arthur Romero, immediately after the fatal incident, that he saw a falling object coming from atop the Paterno Building which fell directly on the head of Sontillano, cannot be accepted in the fight of the clarification made by the same witness, Arthur Romero, when confronted in court that he did not immediately see where the pillbox came because when he saw it, the object was already on top of the head of the victim, Francis Sontillano, and the falling object was then exploding. When this witness reported to Pat. Querimit that the object came from atop the Paterno Building, he clarified that his reference to the Paterno Building as to where the object came from was merely presumed by him. Such explanation or clarification is natural and logical, consistent with human conduct and reaction to unusual occurrences such as the explosion of the pillbox that hit the head of the victim in the case at bar. The first circumstance that must have attracted the attention of the witness, Arthur Romero, was the nearness of the falling object to the head of the victim, followed by the explosion. At any rate, the point at issue is one of credibility where the conclusion of the trial court that heard the evidence is conclusive and binding upon this Court. 


The second assigned error faults the lower court in not disregarding the testimony of the principal prosecution witness, Jose B. Yambao, which the defense brands as clearly and obviously fabricated on the grounds that he has an ""untrustworthy background""; that Yambao was not at the scene of the crime; that his claim that he passed by McArthur Bridge on his way home is incredible; that Yambao's claim that he recognized the accused dela Rosa shows propensity for falsehood; that his failure to immediately report to the police raises grave doubts on his claim; and that said witness Jose Yambao made self-contradictions and inconsistencies in his affidavit and his testimony in court. This assignment of error is not impressed with merit. 


Reviewing the grounds set forth above submitted by the accused-appellant in support of the second assignment of error, it is at once apparent that they all raised the question of credibility of the evidence presented in the trial of the case which, as We have pointed out earlier, the lower court being in a better position to appreciate the same, having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and observed their behavior and manner of testifying, is entitled to respect. Nonetheless, this being an automatic review of the decision imposing the death penalty, We hold that Yambao's credibility as a witness is not impaired by his inability to reply to certain administrative charges filed against him for prolonged absence without leave and deliberate failure to submit his reply, nor by a recommendation of the board of officers of the New Bilibid Prison that Yambao as prison guard be reprimanded for having maltreated prisoners on several occasions. 


Appellant's contention that Yambao was not at the scene of the crime because of alleged contradiction in the latter's testimony on cross-examination that he was standing about five (5) meters from a lamp post on McArthur Bridge towards Plaza Goiti while during the ocular inspection, Yambao pointed to the lamp post of said bridge and that five (5) meters from said lamp post towards Plaza Goiti was actually measured and from that position, the Feati building where Yambao allegedly saw the accused throw a pillbox could not be seen inasmuch as the view is completely obstructed by the Paterno Building, is weak and flimsy. The observation of the lower court that Yambao did not say that he was five meters away from the post after passing it, is to Us, logical. We find no conflict in the statement of Yambao during the ocular inspection that he was standing five meters away before the post on the McArthur bridge coming from Plaza Lawton and his testimony in court prior to the ocular inspection that he was five meters away from the post towards Plaza Goiti for in the first instance, he was coming from Plaza Lawton and in the second, he was at the same time going towards Plaza Goiti. In any event, as the trial court correctly held, which We affirm, persons are easily liable to commit errors in the observation and recollection of minute details of an important occurrence (People vs. Tuazon, L-1733, April 29, 1950, 86 Phil. 278). 


We also reject appellant's submission that Yambao's account is too fantastic to believe not only because it is a gratuitous assertion but also because it has no sound factual basis as against the positive and credible testimony of this witness. More than that, it is of common observation that ordinary citizens like the witness, Jose Yambao, are reluctant to come forward and report to the police authorities to volunteer information that will involve them in court cases. And moreover, whatever inconsistencies or contradictions which the appellant have pointed in his Brief to impugn the credibility of witness Yambao were sufficiently explained and clarified by said witness, Anyway, the inconsistencies are trivial and as We said in People vs. Alcantara, L-26867, June 30, 1970, 33 SCRA 812. ""The contradictions in the declarations of a witness when trivial cannot be ascribed to an insidious attempt to distort the truth. It is a truism that the most candid witness oftentimes commits mistakes and incurs in inconsistencies in his declarations, but such honest lapses do not necessarily impair his intrinsic credibility. Far from being evidence of falsehood they could justifiably be regarded as a demonstration of good faith and a confirmation of the fact that the witness was not a rehearsed witness."" 


Accused-appellant attacks the admissibility of the extra judicial confession, E exhibit "" B "", given by him on December 5, 1970 to Pat. R. Martinez in the Office of the Follow-up Unit, Pct. 2, MPD on the ground that it was involuntary, having been secured by means of force, threats and intimidations. We quote hereunder in full the confession of the accused- appellant, thus:

MGA SAKSI: 


1.	(SGD.) Sgt. JUANITO LAGASCA


	2.	(SGD.) Pat. RICARDO MARTINEZ 


SUBSCRIBED AND SWORN to before me this 5th day of December, 1970, in the City of Manila. 


						(SGD.) (Illegible) 


Asst. City Fiscal


7:00 a.m.


Earlier, We had recited the testimony of the accused-appellant narrating the alleged maltreatment, the force, duress and threats used by the police investigators in obtaining his confession as quoted above. We need not repeat them here. The accused, however, stresses in his Brief that the categorical testimony of maltreatment is borne out by the evidence on record; that the spontaneous complaint of the accused upon seeing his counsel clearly shows involuntariness of confession; that the unholy hour of investigation is consistent with the testimony of the accused as to his maltreatment; that the alleged demonstration by the accused is a deliberate falsehood; that the claim that said accused is left-handed is a blatant lie intended to jibe with the fabricated theory of the police and that the gross inconsistencies of the police investigators surrounding the alleged confession show use of force, threats and intimidation. Accused-appellant further scores the failure of the police to present the alleged informant and that the police investigators had strong motive to pervert the truth. 


Rejecting the defense's claim of involuntariness, the trial court said no evidence was presented by the accused to corroborate the fact of maltreatment; that the statement of the accused is replete with details which could be known to the accused alone and for which the police officers could not be much interested or could not have actually known them, like for example, that the students were shouting and stoning the rooms of the students in the Paterno building and the new main building, slandering the security guards, and shouting that the students boycott their classes; that he saw his companions Ambrosio Pechardo and one Cruz of the Tamaraw guard were injured; that the windows of the Feati University were destroyed; that they threw the pillbox to scare off the student demonstrators; and that he was in the second floor of the new main building at the end portion fronting Helios Street. The answers in his statement were even responsive and informative. The statement itself does not show on its face any suspicious circumstance indicating irregularity. 


This conclusion of the trial court is correct and We affirm the same. For the rule is well-settled that where on its face a confession exhibits no sign of suspicious circumstances tending to cast doubt on its integrity or is replete with details which could possibly be supplied only by the defendant and the response to every question is so fully informative even beyond the requirements of the question as to indicate the mind to be free from extraneous restraints, the confession is considered to have been voluntarily given. This is the doctrine in People vs. Tia Fong, 98 Phil. 609; People vs. Dorado, 30 SCRA 53; People vs. Casillar, 30 SCRA 352; People vs. Pingol, 33 SCRA 73, followed by a long line of cases, the most recent of which are the following: 


Where the statement of the accused mentions details which only the declarant could have furnished and could not have been concocted by the investigator, the confession is considered to have been voluntarily given. (People vs. Barrios, L-34785, July 30, 1979, 92 SCRA 189). 


Details disclosed in the confession which could have been known only by the declarant indicate the voluntariness in executing the same. (People vs. Bautista, 


L-31900, Aug. 6, 1979, 92 SCRA 465) 


Plea that extrajudicial confession was involuntary was not given credence as same is full of details that only accused could have known. (People vs. Beralde, L-32832, June 20, 1979; People vs. Ty Sui Wong, L-32529, May 12, 1978). 


Extra-judicial confession by the accused were voluntarily executed where confessions themselves are indicative of spontaneity and truth. (People vs. Toling, No. 28548, July 13, 1979, 91 SCRA 0182). 


It was also emphasized by the trial court that the extrajudicial confession of the accused was not only subscribed but signed again before Inquest Fiscal Donato Guevarra, who, while testifying as witness of the accused, declared that it is his practice to require a person brought before him to sign again in his presence, so that accused signed again above his first signature; that as witness for the accused, Fiscal Guevarra did not testify to any irregularity in the taking of the statement of the accused. Moreover, the accused was even brought before Mayor Villegas and in the presence of several members of the press, he was asked by the Mayor whether he was the one who threw the pillbox and he answered ""Yes."" The Mayor even asked him whether he knows that the penalty for what he did is death and the accused said that he is ready for that. The accused never denied this. 


We agree with the trial court in considering the above circumstances, among others, as indicative of the voluntariness of the confession, much more so when the verbal admission of the accused before the Chief Executive of the City with members of the press in attendance reiterated his commission of the crime as written in the extrajudical confession, Exhibit ""B"". For there is overwhelming jurisprudence that ""the failure of the accused to complain to the Municipal Judge that he was forced to sign his confession which only the accused could have supplied negates the claim that the said confession was extracted from him through force and intimidation"" (People vs. Abalos, 57 SCRA 330); that the presumption of voluntariness in the execution of the confession was not overcome when it was replete with facts which could possibly be supplied only by the accused and that they substantially interlock, confirming each other as the detail and that the alleged maltreatment was not denounced when the confession was sworn to before the Fiscal (People vs. Casillar, 30 SCRA 3 52; People vs. Pareja, 30 SCRA 693); that where appellant signed his extrajudicial confession in the presence of police officers and two newspapermen and thereafter brought before the City Fiscal where he affirmed the same, signing it once more and he has not presented any medical certificate to prove any injury received by him during the process of taking the confession, his claim that he was maltreated and forced into executing the confession cannot be given credence (People vs. Reyes, 17 SCRA 279). 


Indeed, We find that the decision under review rendered by the Presiding Judge had made a most painstaking scrutiny in weighing the evidence relating to the confession (U.S. VS. Raymundo, 14 Phil. 416) the probative value of such evidence having been addressed in the first instance to said Presiding Judge whose discretion must be controlled by all the attendant circumstances (U.S. vs. De Leon, 27 Phil. 506). And since the Presiding Judge is duty-bound to take into consideration circumstances and conditions under which the confession was obtained in passing upon its weight and admissibility (People vs. Francisco, 74 SCRA 158), the fact as noted in the decision that ""accused is not a hardened criminal for which the police win be hard against him, but a security guard of the Feati University, a station in life which will deter the police to commit any brutality,"" and We may add a profession that exemplifies more than average intelligence, strong courage, discipline courage, rigorous training, belies the claim of the accused that his confession was obtained through force, duress and intimidation. 


Accused-appellant has not also pointed to any evil or bad motive that prompted the police officers to testify against him and since these prosecution witnesses have no reason to impute falsely on the defendant the commission of so grave an offense, they deserve credence and belief. (People vs. Borbano, 76 Phil. 702; People vs. Albapara, 22 SCRA 1043). 


Finally but briefly, on the defense of alibi and his claim that he should have been acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt, We hold and affirm the lower court's ruling that the alibi of the accused is a weak defense, not only because of the facility with which it was fabricated but also because it is so easy for witnesses to get confused as to the dates and becomes worthless in the face of positive Identification by prosecution witnesses pointing to the accused as particeps criminis. For alibi to prosper, the rule is that it is not enough to prove that the defendant was somewhere else when the crime was committed but he must likewise demonstrate that it is physically impossible for him to be in the scene of the crime at the time. In the case at bar, the accused was positively Identified by Jose Yambao, an eyewitness whom the court accorded unimpeachable credibility and the court further took judicial notice that it will not take more than one hour from Josefina Street, Sampaloc, Manila where the accused was supposed to be, to reach the scene of the crime. More than that, the finding of the court that the testimony of the accused alleging that he stayed with Nilda Caracas in Josefina Street for two hours just to get his College Physics from her, is unnatural and improbable since he, being a security guard, wig be under strict order to stay in the premises of the university and on alert due to the impending student demonstration going to the premises of the school, is well justified, to which We give Our affirmance. 


In fine, the prosecution has established the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence on record has produced the required moral certainty as to the guilt of the accused, in an unprejudiced mind. (Sec. 2, Rule 133, Revised Rules of Court). The finding of the court that the crime committed is murder with multiple attempted murder qualified by the use of explosive, is correct, as well as the presence of the aggravating circumstance of treachery without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same. 


The imposition of the death penalty by the trial court is likewise in accordance with law but in the absence of the required votes to affirm the death sentence, the same is hereby reduced to reclusion perpetua. The payment of damages to the heirs of the victim and to the offended parties shall remain. 


WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the decision under review is hereby MODIFIED in that the accused, Arcadio de la Rosa y Landicho, is hereby sentenced to reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Francis Sontillano the sum of Twelve Thousand Pesos (P12,000.00) for the death of the latter, and the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) by way of moral damages, also the sum of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) each to victims Marlon Fuentes, Ciriaco Lagunsad, and Eleuterio Gutierrez by way of moral damages and to pay the costs. Judgment modified. 


SO ORDERED.

MAKASIAR, J., dissenting: 


In his signed confession, the accused-appellant admitted throwing the pillbox only to scare the student demonstrators. Unfortunately, he miscalculated his aim and distance, as it fell on the head of and killed the victim as well as caused physical injuries to three other student demonstrators. It appears therefore that there was no intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed, which should be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance. 


Was the crime committed murder or simply homicide? 


The majority opinion considers the use of explosive as the circumstance to qualify the crime as murder. This is not sustained by paragraph 3 of Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. To qualify the crime as murder, the explosion must involve ""great waste and ruin."" Here, the pillbox was only about the size of a ""balut"" egg and the explosion did not cause great waste and ruin. It caused the death of only one man, and serious physical injuries to three students who were in the vicinity of the explosion, among several hundred demonstrators. If it were a bomb, a grenade, or dynamite sticks, the victims would be numerous. It did not damage any structure in the vicinity. Consequently, the same should not be appreciated as qualifying circumstance. (See People vs. Laigo, 99 Phil. 1061; People vs. Francisco, 94 Phil. 975; People vs. Gallego, et al., 82 Phil. 335; People vs. Agcaoili, 86 Phil. 549; People vs. Guillen, 85 Phil. 307). 


Considering an circumstances favorable to him, it could even be said that the accused is guilty of homicide thru reckless imprudence for he was not able to throw the pillbox way beyond the demonstrators. But he did not aim the pillbox at any particular student. He merely intended to scare the students who were stoning the classrooms and breaking the window glasses of the Feati building and shouting invectives and also hurling stones at the security guards. And because the students inside the classrooms did not want to leave the classrooms, the demonstrators stoned and fired at them. One of his companions was hit. Thus, he stated in his confession: 


... At dahil ayaw lumabas ang mga estudyante sa loob ng mga kuwarto ay pinagbabato nila at pinaputukan ng baril. Nang makita kong may natamaan ng bato sa mga kasama ko at nagkakasirasira ang mga bintana ng Feati University ay naghagis ako ng pillbox para takutin ang mga estudyanteng nambabato para umalis sila sa paligid . Hindi ko alam na mayroon palang natamaan sa aking paghagis. 


T - 	Saan ka ba naroroon ng maghagis ka ng pillbox? 


S - 	Nasa 2nd floor ng New main building sa may dulo nakaharap sa Helios St. 


The appellant continued to state that when he was informed by his companion security guard that someone was hit by the pillbox, he went to call a policeman at Echague St. After he called the policeman, the other student demonstrators loaded the person hit by the pillbox in a taxi. After he informed the chief security officer, Jorge Mendoza, of Feati University about the incident and that one student was hit by the pillbox, Mendoza instructed them to tighten their guarding because the student demonstrators might invade the Feati compound. 


By their taunting and insulting remarks at the students and at the security guards and by hurling stones as wen as firing their guns at the students inside the classrooms and at the security guards, the student demonstrators provoked the appellant security guard to react in the manner he did but only to frighten them without intending to harm them, much less kill them. 


Throwing stones and firing their guns at the students who refused to go out of their classrooms and at the security guards by the student demonstrators, endangered the lives of the students inside the classrooms and the security guards. The act of the appellant in lobbing a pillbox to scare the demonstrators is similar to defense of strangers. 


It is not disputed that the demonstration in December, 1970 and the demonstrations preceding it and subsequent to it were attended by violence or were held in a background of Violence typified by the Mendiola bloody incident. 


While demonstration is protected by the constitutional guarantee of free expression and peaceful assembly, the exercise or enjoyment of which is accorded utmost generosity or liberality, such constitutional rights are not without limitation. When the demonstration is set against the background of violence or staged in the context of violence, it divests itself of constitutional protection; because the employment of violence is illegal (see Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., 312 US 287, 293). In the words of Chief Justice Fernando: ""There is no excuse for violence, injury to property, acts of vandalism. To give vent to one's destructive urge is to call for condemnation. It is to make a mockery of the high estate occupied by intellectual liberty in our constitutional scheme"" (E.M. Fernando, The Bill of Rights, 1977 Ed., p. 621). When a demonstration is accompanied or characterized by violence, it ceases to be peaceful and becomes an illegal assembly which forfeits its right to invoke the protection of the Constitution. 


As Mr. Justice Frankfurther so eloquently stated in the Milk Wagon Drivers Union case, supra: ""It must never be forgotten, however, that the Bill of Rights was the child of the Enlightenment. Back of the guaranty of free speech lay faith in the power of an appeal to reason by all the peaceful means for gaining access to the mind. It was in order to avert force and explosion due to restrictions upon rational modes of communications that the guaranty of free speech was given a generous scope. But utterance in a context of violence can lose its significance as an appeal to reason and become part of an instrument of force. Such utterance was not meant to be sheltered by the Constitution."" 


The appellant herein had the duty as security guard of the school to protect the lives of the students and properties of the institution which employed him. 


The violent provocation initiated by the student demonstrators should therefore justify in characterizing the crime committed by appellant as simple homicide and not murder.

When the demonstration is set against the background of violence or staged in the context of violence, it divests itself of constitutional protection; because the employment of violence is illegal (see Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., 312 US 287, 293). In the words of Chief Justice Fernando: ""There is no excuse for violence, injury to property, acts of vandalism. To give vent to one's destructive urge is to call for condemnation. It is to make a mockery of the high estate occupied by intellectual liberty in our constitutional scheme"" (E.M. Fernando, The Bill of Rights, 1977 Ed., p. 621). When a demonstration is accompanied or characterized by violence, it ceases to be peaceful and becomes an illegal assembly which forfeits its right to invoke the protection of the Constitution. 


As Mr. Justice Frankfurther so eloquently stated in the Milk Wagon Drivers Union case, supra: ""It must never be forgotten, however, that the Bill of Rights was the child of the Enlightenment. Back of the guaranty of free speech lay faith in the power of an appeal to reason by all the peaceful means for gaining access to the mind. It was in order to avert force and explosion due to restrictions upon rational modes of communications that the guaranty of free speech was given a generous scope. But utterance in a context of violence can lose its significance as an appeal to reason and become part of an instrument of force. Such utterance was not meant to be sheltered by the Constitution."" 


The appellant herein had the duty as security guard of the school to protect the lives of the students and properties of the institution which employed him. 


The violent provocation initiated by the student demonstrators should therefore justify in characterizing the crime committed by appellant as simple homicide and not murder.
