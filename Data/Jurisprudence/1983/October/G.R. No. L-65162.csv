FERNANDO, 
CJ.:


In this application for habeas corpus filed by Monico B. Biglaen on behalf of his friend, Marcelo A, Mesina, Identified as a licensed foreign exchange dealer, it was alleged: ""On or about September 26, 1983, [at] about 4:30 in the afternoon, the said Marcelo A. Mesina was forcibly taken from his aforesaid place of business by individuals posing as members of the Intelligence Special Operations Division, Western Police District, Metropolitan Police Force, brought to respondent Maj. Ernesto Manzano of the PC Metrocom West Sector Command at Malacanang, Manila, and forthwith confined, restrained and deprived of his liberty in the detention cell of the Military Security Unit/Service at Fort Bonifacio, Makati, Metro Manila; 3. inspite of the fact that the abovenamed Marcelo A. Mesina has been confined at the Military Security Unit/Service at Fort Bonifacio, Makati, Metro Manila, no formal complaint or accusation for any specific offense has been filed against him nor any judicial writ or order for his commitment has at any time been issued so far; 4. The abovenamed Marcelo A. Mesina did not commit any offense whatsoever for which he may be arrested or deprived of his liberty without any formal charge or judicial warrant; 5. According to reliable information of the petitioner, his friend, Marcelo A, Mesina, is now being unlawfully deprived of his liberty for engaging in the business of foreign exchange, which business, however, he is duly authorized by the Central Bank of the Philippines to engage in. Attached hereto as Annex 'A' is a photocopy of said permit to engage in the business of foreign exchange; 6. Martial law having been lifted and, most of all, there being no formal charge being filed against Marcelo A. Mesina, it is respectfully submitted that under the circumstances his detention is utterly illegal.""
