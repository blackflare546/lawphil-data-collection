All appealed, with 3 separate Briefs having been filed. one, for Alvis, Santos, Dominico, Oliver, Villamor, Balais, Ramos and Llamoso; the other for Ariola, Galang, Ramirez and Salem and the third for Borebor and Geron. The Solicitor General filed a consolidated Brief. 


The prosecution has summarized the facts as follows 






On or about October 16, 1971, several prisoners confined in Dormitory 5-B of the New Bilibid Prison Muntinglupa, Rizal all members of the notorious ""Bahala Na Gang"", held a meeting at the ""Kubol"" (quarters) of prisoner Jose Balais. The meeting was conducted by prisoner Jesus Alvis and Balais ""bosiyo"" (bosses or leaders) of Dormitory 5-B, also referred to as a brigade, Alvis being the ""Chief squad leader"" or ""Mayor"" and Balais the ""Assistant mayor"". 


In that meeting, which began at 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening and lasted up to 11 P.M., it was decided that Andres Esporlas, prison guard, who was regarded as ""too strict"", would be liquidated, and that after that the prisoners would stage a mass escape. As agreed upon the details of the plan were: The plotters would have a prisoner box Esporlas, after which they would take turns clubbing the said prison guard. Prisoner Eduardo Villamor, who resembled Esporlas, would then wear the latter's uniform and thereafter feign to escort the other prisoners to the Reception Diagnostic Center, from the roof of which they would scale the perimeter fence. it was also decided in that meeting that prisoner Miguel Obiña an ex-professional boxer, would be the one to box Esporlas. 


Present in the aforesaid meeting, other than Alvis and Balais, were the following prisoners: Villamor, Policarpio, Ramirez, Federico Dominico, Arturo Santos, Guilberto Llamoso, Eduardo Ariola, Antonio Borebor and Rodolfo Geron. 


The foregoing facts concerning the someting which took place on or about October 16, 1971 may be culled from the testimony of prosecution witness Antonio Reyes (tsn January 15, 1974, p. 11), who shared quarters with Balais, and from the sworn statements of Dominico (Exh. ""E""), Ramirez (Exh ""F""), and Borebor (Exh ""R""). 


Pursuant to the agreement arrived at in the said meeting Villamor contacted Obifia and gave him the order to box Esporlas. To ensure that Obiña would comply, Villamor threatened him and told him that he would watch him closely Obifia was not however informed of the details of the plot. (Exh. ""P"", sworn statement of Villamor). 


The plan hatched in the meeting of October 16, 1971 was implemented in the evening of October 18, 1971, at around 7 'o clock, while Esporlas, keeper of Dormitory 5-B, was about to conduct a headcount of the prisoners in that brigade, As soon as the prisoners, numbering more than one hundred, had lined up for the counting and Esporlas had entered the dormitory, Obiña suddenly stood and boxed Esporlas on the jaw. This was testified to by prisoners Isidro Bondoc (tsn January 7, 1974, pp. 19-20) and Antonio Reyes (tsn, January 15, 1974, pp. 7-8), prosecution witnesses who were in Dormitory 5-B and actually saw the incident. 


After Obiña boxed Esporlas, the following prisoners clubbed the said prison guard Alvis (Exh. 'R', sworn statement of Borebor Balais (Exh.. ""R""), Villamor Exh. ""P"", his own sworn statement; Exh. ""E"", sworn statement of Dominico; Exh. ""F"", sworn statement of Ramirez), Ramirez (Exh. ""R"", his own sworn statement Exhs. ""E"", arid ""P""), Dominico (Exh. ""E"", his own sworn statement; Exh. ""S"", sworn statement of Santos; Exhs. ""F"" and ""P""), Rolando Ramos (Exhs. ""P"" and ""S""), Santos (Exh. ""S"", his own sworn statement; Exh. ""E"", ""F"", ""P"" and ""R""), Llamoso (Exh. ""F""), Borebor (Exh. ""F""), and Geron Exhs. ""F"", ""R"" and ""S""). In addition, eyewitnesses Bondoc and Reyes testified that Balais, Villamor, Ramirez, Dominico, Ramos, Galang and Borebor were among those who mauled Esporlas (tan, January 7, 1974, p. 20; tsn, January 9, 1974; p. 13; tsn, January 15, 1974, p. 8). E sporlas was rendered unconscious by the mauling (tsn, January 7,1974, p. 20; tsn, January 15,1974, p. 9). 


At this point, Villamor, Dominico and Ariola took off Esporlas' uniform (tsn, January 7, 1974, p. 20; tsn, January 15, 1974, p.8; Exh. ""S""), while Reydante Salem and Dominico removed his shoes (tsn, January 1974, 8; Exh. ""R"" and ""S""). Then Villamor shouted that those prosners who wanted to could join the escape (Exh. ""S"")


By this time, prisoners in the other qqqed to a out what was happening, This caused panic on the plotting prisoners Villamor and Borebor then decided to have Esporlas taken to the hospital for fear that he would die while in their hands Exh. ""S""). Accordingly, Salem took Esporlas to the hospital (tsn, January 16, 1974, p. 4; Exh. ""S""). 


To dissemble their plan to prevent Obifia from giving any statement to the authorities, Alvis ordered his group to beat up Obiña and thereby make it appear that they did not approve of what he had done to Esporlas (Exh. ""H"", sworn statement of Alvis; Exh. ""P""). Those who roughed up Obiña were the following: Alvis (Exh. ""L"", sworn statement of Ariola; Exh. ""M"", sworn statement of Ramos; Exh. ""T"", sworn statement of Llamoso; Exh. ""R"", tsn, January 9, 1974, p. 15; tsn, January 15, 1974, p. 9), Balais (Exh. ""Q"", his own sworn statement; Exhs. ""L"", ""M"", ""R"" and ""T"", tsn, January 9, 1974, p. 15; tsn, January 15, 1974, p. 9), Ramirez (Exh. ""M""), Ramos (Exh. ""M"", his own sworn statement), Llamoso (Exh. ""T"", his own sworn statement; Exh. ""L""), Ariola (Exh. ""L"", his own sworn statement; tsn, January 9, 1974, p. 15; tsn, January 15, 1974, p. 9), Geron (Exh. 'G', his own sworn statement; tsn, January 7, 1974, p. 20), Santos (tsn, January 7, 1974, p. 20), Oliver (tsn, January 7, 1974, p. 20; tsn, January 9, 1974, p. 15; tsn, January 15, 1974, p. 9), Dominico (tsn, January 7, 1974, p. 20; tsn, January 9, 1974, p. 15), Villamor (tsn, January 7, 1974, p. 20), Galang (tsn, January 9, 1974, p. 15), and Borebor (tsn, January 7, 1974, p. 20; tsn, January 9, 1974, p. 15). Obiña was also rendered unconscious (tsn, January 7, 1974, p. 20). Believing that Obiña was already dead, they had him taken to the hospital (Exh. ""P""). 


As a result of the aforementioned incident, Esporlas suffered injuries on the left jaw and in the brain (Exh. ""C"" and "" C-3"", tsn, December 19, 1973, p. 5). He had an hematoma at the back of the head above the nape (tsn, January 15, 1974, p. 4). When he was admitted in the New Bilibid Prison Hospital and later in the Veterans Memorial Hospital, he was unconscious and in serious condition (Exh. ""C"", tsn, December 19, 1973, p. 5). He never regained consciousness and died after several days (Exh. 'E', death certificate; tsn, December 19, 1973, pp. 6, 7). Had he lived, one-half of his body, both upper and lower parts, would have been completely paralyzed and his face would have been deformed and his memory impaired (ibid., p. 7). 


With respect to Obiña, he suffered injuries on the forehead, nape, right and left legs, and left hand (Exhs. ""A"", ""A-11"", and ""A-2"", tsn, December 14, 1973, pp. 8-10). At the time he was taken to the New Bilibid Prison Hospital, he was unconscious, his pulse was imperceptible, and he was in serious condition (tsn, December 14, 1973, p. 8). Obifia would have died were it not for timely medical attendance (tsn, December 14, 1973, p. 13). 


Immediately after the incident prison authorities conducted an investigation The statements of Ariola (Exh. ""L"") and Llamoso (Exh. ""I"") were taken on October 21, 1971; that of Ramos Exh. ""M"") on October 22; those of Alvis (Exhs. ""H"" and ""H-l""), Balais (Exhs. ""Q"" and ""Q-l""), Villamor (Exhs. ""P"" and ""P-1""), Borebor (Exhs. ""R"" and ""R-l"", and Santos Exh.

All the declarations of the afore. mentioned prisoners contain statements to the effect that the declarants were advised of their constitutional rights and that the same were voluntarily given.

Eduardo Ariola also a member of the Bahala Na Gang, testffied that the victim was killed by Obiña and he of the death of said victim thru the co-employees of Esporlas that Esporlas was very good to them and he was near him helping the latter in counting the prisoners; that he was inside the brigade on October 18, 1971, and when he learned of the incident he ran out but was blocked from the door because they did not like what Obiña did to Esporlas that he had no participation whatsoever in the boxing of Esporlas

Policarpio Ramirez who testified that he was also a member of the Bahala Na Gang and a resident of dormitory 5-B; that on October 18, 1971, he was in his qqqtarima and he saw Obiña box Esporlas and when he asked Obiña why he did it he the latter did not answer, so he boxed and beat him. 


Reydante Salem a resident of Dormitory 5-B and a member of the Bahala Na Gang testified that in the evening of October 18, 1971, he was at the brigade with Antonio Reyes, Isidro Bondoc and Temporosa that he was inside the bathroom taking a bath when he heard a noise and after taking a bath he fixed himself in preparation for the counting of the keeper, that while Esporlas was already inside the brigade, Miguel Obiña a suddenly stood up in front of Esporlas and boxed him on the face, that Esporlas fell down and he was about two or three meters away from the incident so that he helped his companions, namely: Lopez Generoso and Dugtong in bringing Esporlas to the hospital and from there he did not know anymore what happened to Esporlas, because he was sent home by the nurse.

It should be noted that, initially, the accused were also charged with Frustrated Murder for the injuries inflicted on Miguel Obiña. However, after the prosecution had rested its case, upon motion of the defense, the Trial Court dismissed that charge primarily on the ground that Miguel Obiña was never presented by the prosecution and the charge could not be substantiated. The records show that it was actually Atty. Benjamin Domingo, one of the accuseds counsel who presented Obifia as a witness.

During the pendency of this appeal Ramirez and Dominico died so that the case as against them was dismissed in so far as their criminal liabilities are concerned.

In their respective Briefs, accused-appellants assigned the following errors: 


1)	By Alvis, Santos, Dominico, Oliver, Villamor, Balais, Ramos and Llamoso 






1)	That the lower court erred in believing the testimony of Miguel Obifia and other witnesses for the prosecution, 


2)	That the lower court erred in not giving weight to the testimonies of the appellants and their witnesses; 


3)	That the lower court erred in convicting the accused appellants. 






2)	By Ariola Galang, Ramirez and Salem: 






1)	That the trial court erred in considering treachery and evident premeditation as an aggravating circumstance; 


2)	That the trial court erred in convicting them 


3)	That the trial court erred in not acquitting them, beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder.






3)	By Borebor and Geron 






1)	The trial court erred in not finding that Miguel Obiña was the lone assailant of Andres Esporlas;


2)	The trial court erred in finding that Borebor and Geron had conspired with their co-accused in the killing of Esporlas; 


3)	The trial court erred in convicting Borebor and Geron on the basis of their alleged extrajudicial confession of guilt 


4)	The trial court erred in convicting Borebor and Geron on the basis of the purported extrajudicial confessions of Borebor, Dominico and Ramirez; 


5)	The trial court erred in not acquitting Borebor and Geron on ground of reasonable doubt, 


6)	Assuming 
arguendo
 that the culpability of the accused for the death of Andres Esporlas has been established by proof beyond reasonable doubt, nevertheless, the trial court erred: 






a)	in finding that the killing was attended by the qualifying circumstance of treachery and the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation and recidivism and 


b)	in failing to appreciate voluntary surrender and lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong as mitigating circumstances in favor of Borebor and Geron 






7)	The trial court erred in ordering Borebor and Geron to pay actual, moral and exemplary damages to the heirs of Esporlas and the costs of suit.






All of which funnel down to the core issue of whether or not the guilt of all the accused has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 


The combined evidence calls for an affirmative finding. We find as established that at a meeting held in the evening of October 16, 1971 by members of the ""
Bahala Na Gang
"" in Dormitory 5-B of the New Bilibid Prison, Muntinglupa, headed by accused Jesus Alvis and Jose Balais, as ""
bosiyo
"" it was agreed that prison guard, Andres Esporlas, would be liquidated (""
ipatira
"") and thereafter the prisoners would stage a mass escape. Prisoner Miguel Obiña, an ex-professional was selected to box Esporlas. Present at the meeting than Alvis and Balais were accused Villamor, Ramirez, Dominico, Santos, Llamoso, Ariola, Borebor and Geron Villamor thereafter contacted Obifia and instructed him to box Esporlas, threatening him with harm ff he did not comply. Obiña, however, was not informed of the other details of the plot. 


On October 18, 1971, at around 7:00 P.M., while Esporlas was about to conduct a headcount of prisoners in Dormitory 5-B, Obiña suddenly stood up and boxed Esporlas on the left jaw. Esporlas reeled but managed to stand up after which Alvis, Balais Villamor, Ramirez, Dominico, Ramos, Santos, Llamoso, Borebor and Geron clubbed Esporlas. Inmate Antonio Reyes (not one of the accused also Identified those who had ganged up and clubbed Esporlas as Ramirez, Dominico, Galang, Ramos, Ariola, Salem and Villamor, the latter having beaten the victim with a ""pamalo"" wrapped in white T-Shirt. Villamor, Dominico and Ariola took off Esporlas"" uniform, while Salem and Dominico removed the victim's shoes. These last two overt acts were in pursuance of the groups plan to make Villamor appear like Esporlas Accused Borebor likewise made mention of the following as responsible for the killing of Esporlas. Ramirez, Dominico, Borebor, Villamor and Ramos.

 Esporlas was rendered unconscious by the mauling. For fear that he would die in their hands, Salem took Esporlas to the hospital, upon instructions of Villamor and Borebor, where he died several days after. 


After the mauling of Esporlas, Alvis ordered the group to beat up Obiña to make it appear that they did not approve of what he had done to Esporlas. Responsible for the roughing up of Obiña were. Alvis, Balais Ramirez, Ramos, Llamoso, Ariola, Geron Oliver, Dominico, Villamor, Galang and Borebor. As a result, Obiña was rendered unconscious, taken to the hospital and would have died but for timely medical assistance. 


The contention of Borebor and Geron that Obiña was the sole perpetrator of the crime and should have been the one charged and convicted deserves but passing consideration In accused Dominico's statement, 
7
 he stated that Esporlas was still standing after Obifia delivered the blow. To quote: 










8.T.	— Isalaysay mo nga sa aking ang tunay na pangyayari na naganap sa loob ng brigada ninyo sangayon sa iyong sinasabi? 


S.	— Nang araw at oras po na binanggit ko sa itaas ay kinalampag ni Jesus Alvis ang pintuan ng aming brigada na kasama sa labas ni Mr. Esporlas, Jose Balais at Eddie Arreola. Pagkabukas po ng pinto ay pumasok na sila at kami naman ay nakatarima na at ang iba ay hindi pa. Nasa ganoon pong ayos ng biglang tumayo si Miguel Obiña at walang kaabog-abog ay sinuntok niya si Mr. Esporlas sa kanang panga. Nahilo po si Mr. Esporlas subalit nakatayo pa rin at sabay palo namin nina Ramirez, Villamor, Arturo Santos. Ako po ay pumalo sa kanang braso, minsan lamang, si Villamor po naman ay sa ulo, si Ramirez po ay sa ulo rin at si Arturo Santos po naman ay sa dibdib. Pagkapalo po namin ng sabay sabay ay bumagsak si Mr. Esporlas na ang parteng ulo ay malapit sa pintuan ng aming brigada Nagkagulo po ang mga tao, si Obiña po naman ay pinagpapalo na ng aking mga kasamahan hanggang sa mawalan ng malay tao. Nang magkagulo po ang mga tao ay nagpunta na ako sa kubol ko nang lumabas ako ay wala na o naihatid na si Mr. Esporlas sa Ospital.










A similar declaration was made by accused Ramirez (now deceased). And eyewitness Reyes testified that it was only after Esporlas was clubbed and hit on the head and other parts of his body by the accused that Esporlas fell down on the floor. 
8
 The extensive injuries suffered by Esporlas in the brain must have resulted from the clubbings delivered by several persons. In other words, Esporlas' death was not the consequence of Obiñas act of boxing said victim but was the result of the accused's concerted assault again him Obiña was just the ""fall guy."" 


Accused Alvis, Geron, Ariola Llamoso, Santos, Ramos, Borebor, Balais Villamor, Dominico and Ramirez executed their respective sworn statements admitting their participation in the mauling of Esporlas and Obiña. 
9
 Obiña was assaulted to prevent him from giving any statement to the authorities. 


On the witness stand, however, the same accused repudiated their sworn statements alleging maltreatment, and denied any participation in the mauling of Esporlas. As concluded by the Trial Court, however, the repudiation did not ring with truth. The answers to the questions in the several statements show spontaneity. The facts contained therein could not have been given by any one unfamiliar with the sequence of the acts narrated therein. Some of the declarations were exculpatory in character. The statements were taken and executed a few days after the incident in question when those who participated and witnessed the crime did not have sufficient time to fabricate the evidence. What is more, the statements substantially interlock and confirm one another as to details. The presumption that the statements were voluntarily given was not successfully rebutted. Significantly, the statements of eyewitnesses Bondoc and Reyes 
10
 corroborated the accused's statements in many details. Extra-judicial confessions independently made without collusion, almost Identical with each other in their essential details and corroborated by other evidence on record are admissible as substantial evidence against the person or persons implicated to show probability of the latter's actual participation in the commission of the crime. 
11
 The inconsistencies pointed out by the defense refer merely to details and not to substance. 


We likewise find for conspiracy. ""Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it"" 
12
, the objective being to perform an act or omission punishable by law. 
13
 
The accused had held a meeting in the ""
kubol
"" of Balais two days prior to the incident to plan the killing of Esporlas, to choose Obiña as their "" fall guy"", he being a professional boxer, and to map out their mass escape. And even if not all of the accused were at the meeting, as the plot was eventually carried out, all of them performed acts with unity of purpose and intention in furtherance of the conspiracy and are, therefore, liable as co-principals for the murder of Esporlas. 


The crime shown to have been committed beyond reasonable doubt is Murder. It was qualified by treachery and aggravated by abuse of superior strength which is absorbed by treachery, evident premeditation and quasi-recidivism The killing took place inside the New Bilibid Prison where the accused were serving sentences for other offenses for which they were previously convicted by final judgment. The Trial Court correctly imposed the maximum period of the penalty which is death. 
14
 And even if Article 160 were inapplicable, as Borebor and Geron contend, the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation without any mitigating circumstance to offset it would still warrant capital punishment, However, for lack of the necessary votes, the death penalty is commuted to 
reclusion perpetua
. 
15
 


Appellants are not entitled to the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong as that committed, as contended by Borebor and Geron. They reported the incident to the authorities and took Esporlas to the hospital merely to cover up for their illegal acts and aborted plan for mass escape, Besides, the special aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism cannot be offset by any ordinary mitigating circumstance. 
16
 


The award of actual moral and exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim is in order. 
17
 


WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, except as to the penalty, which is hereby modified to 
reclusion perpetua
. 


With proportionate costs. 


SO ORDERED.
