RELOVA, 
J.:


On March 19, 1944, at eight o'clock in the morning, Leandro Cataumber, a former vice-mayor of Pitogo, Quezon, was taken against his will and under compulsion from his house in the poblacion of Pitogo, by armed men led by Florentino Abadilla, accompanied by Teodoro Banal, Eladio Satira, Leocadio Entienza and other unidentified persons. Abadilla was armed was paltik and the others with bolos, when they brought Cataumber from his house to the mountains. 


The following day, March 20, 1944, one Sergio Dionela, a friend of Cataumber, was likewise taken by armed men. While in captivity, Dionela was told by Leocadio Entienza that he had already, killed Cataumber. In fact, Entienza compelled Dionela to swallow a pair of human ears which the former said belonged to Cataumber. 


Dionela was later able to escape. 


On April 9, 1944, dismembered remains of a human body were found by members of the Cataumber family in barrio Payte, Pitogo, Quezon. It was their belief that the said remains were those of the ex-vice mayor. 


Information was filed by the Provincial Fiscal of Quezon Province in 1957 against (1) Florentino Abadilla, (2) Eladio Satira, (3) Leocadio Entienza, (4) Teodoro Banal alias Mestisong Aeta and others, charging them for kidnapping with murder. The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 440-G of the Court of First Instance of Quezon Province, 


On March 23, 1971, a decision was rendered in said case, the dispositive portion of which reads: 






WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused FLORENTINO ABADILLA, TEODORO BANAL and LEOCADIO ENTIENZA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of kidnapping with murder and hereby sentences each of them to suffer imprisonment for LIFE and they are ordered jointly and severally to indemnify the heirs of Leandro Cataumber the sum of P12,000.00, with costs against them."" 


Teodoro Banal alias Aeta appealed from the foregoing judgment, assigning as errors, the following: 


1.	The lower court erred in holding that the accused-appellant Teodoro Banal was positively Identified by Noe Cataumber, son of the victim and Rafael Perez, a disinterested witness when as a matter of factual truth not only said Rafael Perez but another witness for the prosecution, Antonio Parcarey an eye witness to the incident, categorically told the truth that Teodoro Banal was not with the group of about ten (10) persons who went to the house of Leandro Cataumber on said date, March 19, 1944. 


2.	The lower court erred in holding that the skeletal remains found by Artemio Batralo and his party at barrio Payte, Pitogo, Quezon, on April 9, 1944 were those of Leandro Cataumber when even the Municipal Health Officer refused to issue a death certificate and a certification that those skeletal remains were the mortal remains of said Leandro Cataumber. 


3.	The lower court erred in giving undue weight and credit to the highly improbable testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution which are mostly hearsay, bias, reeking of inherent self-inconsistencies and pregnant with glaring contradictions on vital points which render them all totally incredible. 


4.	The lower court erred in giving every ounce of benefit to the prosecution and in not resolving even a gram of doubt in favor of the appellant Teodoro Banal and in totally disregarding the evidence for the defense; and 


5.	The lower court erred in finding appellant Teodoro Banal guilty of the offense charged in the information and in not acquitting said appellant. 






Appellant Teodoro Banal assails the lower court's conclusion that he was positively Identified in the scene of the crime by a competent witness. In this connection there is the testimony of Noe Cataumber, the victim's own son and a townmate of Banal who positively Identified the latter as one of those who, in broad daylight kidnapped Leandro Cataumber, as he and his family were peacefully performing household chores on March 19, 1944. 


Reproduced hereunder is the testimony of Noe Cataumber:

Against the positive Identification of appellant Teodoro Banal by Noe Cataumber and Francisco Glinoga appellant relied on the defense of alibi. He claimed that as the bodyguard of Col. de Luna who was then in command of the Guerilla Detachment stationed at Calasingan, Gumaca, Quezon they never left the camp in the month of March 1944. Further, he alleged that he was included in the complaint due to his refusal to be a witness for the prosecution. 


As has been consistently held in several cases, alibi is a weak defense and becomes more so if uncorroborated, and worse, if it could have been corroborated by other persons mentioned by the accused but were not presented. (People vs. Brioso, 37 SCRA 336; People vs. Bagasala, 39 SCRA 236; People vs. Cariño 55 SCRA 516). 


The claim of herein appellant that he was present elsewhere at the time the crime was committed has to be shown by evidence that commands assent. Unfortunately, herein appellant was not able to do so. The positive Identification by prosecution witnesses placed a burden on him too difficult to overcome by the allegation that he was in company of another person at another place. The defense of denial and of alibi could not prevail over the positive Identification of herein appellant by prosecution witnesses Noe Cataumber and Francisco Glinoga as one of the authors of the kidnapping. And, neither is motive essential for conviction where there is no doubt as to the Identity of the culprit. Otherwise stated, motive is pertinent only when there is doubt as to the Identity of the culprit. 


However, we agree with the observation of the Solicitor General that the remains found in barrio Payte twenty (20) days after the victim Leandro Cataumber was kidnapped could not be the remains of the said victim. Between March 19, 1944 and April 9, 1944, only twenty (20) days had passed and the advanced stage of decomposition of the remains found could not have been that of Leandro Cataumber. As aptly stated by the Solicitor General in his brief, ""considering the proof available in this case, appellant may not be made responsible for murder; his constitutional right to be presumed innocent of this particular crime has not been sufficiently overcome by the evidence introduced in court 
a quo.
 "" Thus, appellant could only be held liable for simple kidnapping, as defined in Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code which before its amendment by Republic Act 18 (which took effect on September 25, 1946), is penalized by 
reclusion temporal.
 The kidnapping of Leandro Cataumber occurred on March 19, 1944. 


ACCORDINGLY, the judgment of the trial court -is hereby modified in that appellant Teodoro Banal is found guilty only of the crime of kidnapping and is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to Seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
 as maximum; to indemnify the heirs of Leandro Cataumber jointly and severally with his co-accused, in the sum of P12,000.00, and to pay the costs. 


SO ORDERED.
