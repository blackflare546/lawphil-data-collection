CONCEPCION, JR., 
J.:


Diosdado Alvarado, Jr., Sofronio Pegares, Justiniano Oracion, and Salazar Aragon were charged before the Court of First Instance of Leyte with the crime of Robbery in Band with Rape and Multiple Physical Injuries committed as follows:

1
 The Court, upon motion of the appellant Salazar Aragon, also dismissed the appeal of the said accused on August 22, 1975. 
2
 For consideration is the appeal of the accused Justiniano Oracion and Sofronio Pegares. 


The facts of the case, as enumerated by the Solicitor General in his brief, are as follows: 




The spouses Alfonso Mesario and Celerina Saladores (pp. 41, 137, t.s.n., Cazar) rice mill and store owners, and dealers in copra and hemp (p. 71, t.s.n., Cazar) live in their house at barrio Biasong, Baybay, Leyte, together with their relatives, namely: Simeon Mesario and his family (pp. 88, 110, 112, t.s.n., Cazar); Dionisia Saladores, Magdalena Arejola, Flora Prado, Apra Mesario, Winston Mesario, Roberta (Baby) Arejola, and their maid Juanita Andrade (t.s.n., pp. 19, 67, 78, 91, 92, 115-117, Arradaza; pp. 7, 9, t.s.n., Cazar). 


At about 2 o'clock in the early morning of February 6, 1967, the accused Diosdado Alvarado, Sofronio Pegares, Justiniano Oracion and Salazar Aragon, each armed with a revolver (pp. 21, 22, t.s.n., Arradaza), and accused Antonio Sy, forcibly entered the aforesaid house of Alfonso Mesario by boring their way in thru the kitchen door (p. 92, t.s.n., Cazar). Once inside the house, the four accused, except Antonio Sy, proceeded to and entered the room lighted by a kerosene lamp occupied by Dionisia Saladores, Magdalena Arejola, Flora Prado, Apra Mesario, Winston Mesario, Roberta (Baby) Arejola and Juanita Andrade who were then all asleep (Exh. 'D', pp. 7, 8, 19, 20, 29, 78, 91, 92, 115-117, t.s.n., Arradaza). 


Aroused by the intrusion, Dionisia Saladores shouted for help (t.s.n., pp. 21, 22, 66, 69, Arradaza; pp. 9, 50, 51, Cazar) prompting Sofronio Pegares to hold and hit her head and other parts of her body with his revolver (t.s.n., 23, 25, Arradaza; p. 12, Cazar). The three other accused, Diosdado Alvarado, Justiniano Oracion and Salazar Oracion, ransacked the two '
aparadores
' inside the room (t.s.n., pp. 25, 26, 36, Arradaza; pp. 9, 10, Cazar) and got P 4,000.00 in paper bills and jewelries worth P 500.00 in all belonging to Dionisia Saladores ( t.s.n., pp, 26, 35, 36, Arradaza; pp. 10, 30, 38, Cazar). 


As the accused were ransacking the place, Magdalena Arejola and Flora Prado hid themselves under the bed (pp. 71, 95, 112, t.s.n., Arradaza). Celerina Saladores (Dionisia's sister) who was occupying a room across the sala locked her room when she heard outcries for help and told her husband, Alfonso Mesario, to hide which the latter did (pp. 40, 41, 50, 56, 89, Cazar), while their married son Simeon Mesario who was in another room escaped thru the window of his room. He was, however, fired upon by one of the robbers (p. 89, t.s.n., Cazar) hitting with gunshot on the left portion of his left arm. He further suffered dislocation of both knees, swelling of his testicles and pains at the back of his waist, as a consequence of his having jumped from the window and landing on the cement pavement (pp. 90, 91, t.s.n., Cazar). 


Later, accused Diosdado Alvarado after forcibly opening the window entered Celerina's room. Once inside he opened the door for accused Sofronio Pegares who carried a kerosene lamp (Exh. 'D', pp. 41-53, 57, 58, t.s.n., Cazar). Accused Sofronio Pegares, once inside the room, kicked Celerina and asked her for money. When Celerina shouted for help one of the accused threatened her with his revolver. Accused Diosdado Alvarado and Sofronio Pegares then ransacked her aparador by forcibly opening the lock thereof and found four (4) bundles of her money in paper bills amounting to P4,000.00 which they pocketed (pp. 43, 44, 50, 58- 60, 69, 76, t.s.n., Cazar). Thereafter, they demanded of Celerina the key to her trunk and when the accused could not open the trunk, accused Sofronio Pegares kicked her on her right waist line and compelled her to open the trunk (pp. 44, 45, 50, 60, t.s.n., Cazar). The trunk yielded another P4,000.00 in paper bills and P200.00 in coins which were all taken by Diosdado Alvarado (pp. 45, 46, 61-63, t.s.n., Cazar). 


While the robbery in the room of Celerina Saladores was taking place, Magdalena Arejola and Flora Prado who hid themselves under the bed in Dionisia's room were dragged therefrom by accused Justiniano Oracion and Salazar Aragon, respectively (pp. 96, 97, t.s.n., Arradaza). Magdalena Arejola struggled and tried to extricate herself from accused Justiniano Oracion. Her struggles prove futile as Oracion was able to drag her towards the kitchen where Magdalena saw Antonio Sy when the flashlight of Justiniano Oracion was focused on his face (p. 97, t.s.n., Arradaza). Threatening her with his revolver, Justiniano Oracion brought her downstairs and took her to the coconut plantation about 100 meters from the house, despite Magdalena's struggles (p. 98, t.s.n., Arradaza). When Magdalena refused to remove her panty despite threats by Oracion, the latter grabbed her panty, tearing it away from her body (p. 99, t.s.n., Arradaza). After a vigorous struggle, Magdalena weakened and Justiniano Oracion was able to insert his penis inside her vagina for which she felt pain (p. 99, t.s.n., Arradaza). After ravishing her, Justiniano Oracion took her to a hill and down to a ricefield. On their way Oracion fell down enabling Magdalena to free herself from his hands and escaped towards the bushes where she hid herself until about 6 o'clock that morning when she went home and immediately informed the people therein that she was abused (pp. 100, 103, t.s.n., Arradaza). 


On the other hand, Salazar Aragon who dragged Flora Prado from under the bed brought her to the kitchen. Despite threats with a revolver, she resisted Salazar Aragon who, after tearing her panty, forced her to lie down and laid on top of her. Notwithstanding her struggles, Aragon's penis penetrated her organ and she felt wet substance inside her organ (pp. 73, 74, 83, t.s.n., Arradaza). Upon hearing shouts from the outside, accused Salazar Aragon stood up. Finding herself free from Aragon's clutches, she ran towards a room and again hid herself under one of the beds. There, she felt pain in her vagina and in all parts of her body (p. 74, t.s.n., Arradaza).

The appellant Justiniano Oracion denied participation in the commission of the crime claiming that he was in barrio Palhi, Baybay, Leyte, at the time the offense complained of was committed. His testimony, as summarized by the trial judge, is as follows: 




The third witness 
Justiniano Oracion,
 also a co-accused, testified that at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening of February 5, 1967, he was running a game of '
hantak
' which lasted until 2:00 O'clock in the morning of February 6. After the game, he was taken by Max Cerna to the store of Margarita Barrientos in Barrio Palhi. In the store they were joined by Alfredo Viterbo, Agripino Escuadra and Primitovo Ybañez, Jr. 


He further testified that they stayed in the store until 3:00 o'clock in the morning. After that he went home together with Alfredo and Primitivo and eat the leftovers. The three (3) of them then went to sleep and at around 8:00 o'clock in the morning, he woke up. 


On February 8, he went to the market to buy rice and some viands but at around 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, he was apprehended by the two policemen and then taken to the police headquarters for investigation. Confronted by Magdalena Arejola and Flora Prado, both simply shook their heads although he noticed that Policeman Wagas whispered something to them. 


In Court he admitted knowing the names of these women because he said that they used to buy his copra and as a matter of fact, he used to mill his rice at their residence. Further interrogated, he admitted knowing the accused, Diosdado Alvarado, before February 7. 


On cross-examination, he admitted that there is a trail that leads from the barrio of Palhi to Biasong and runs a distance of about two (2) kilometers which can be negotiated on foot in a period of one (1) hour. As a matter of fact, he knew the house in Barrio Biasong to be owned by Mesario and the milling machine is even beside the house. His copra are even weighed and sold right in the house of Mesario on the ground floor. He also admitted that he knows in person Flora and Magdalena because of their business dealings, and between them they know each other both in appearances and names.

The appellant Sofronio Pegares also denied participation in the commission of the crime and similarly interposed the defense of 
alibi
. His testimony is summarized as follows: 




The accused witness, also a co-accused, 
Sofronio Pegares
, testified that he is from the city of Butuan and that he only come to Baybay the first time in January, 1967, to look for his daughter, Conchita, who left their house. Precisely he came to Baybay to follow her because he suspected her to have ran away with the accused, Diosdado Alvarado, who comes from this town. 


He also testified that he went straight to the residence of Diosdado at barrio Palhi on January 20, 1967, but that the only person who was in the house was his sister, Barbara Alvarado. Temporarily he resided in the house of Diosdado and that from January 29 up to February 5, he had not gone to any of the barrios here in Baybay. 


Testifying further, he stated that on the night of February 5, 1967, he went to the sitio of Cabacongan together with Barbara. That time the other accused, Diosdado, was attending a dance in Barrio Palhi. He went to bed at around 3:00 o'clock in the morning of February 6 because he arrived late from the house of a neighbor, Roman Jaca, who died. 


The following morning, several policemen called at the house of Diosdado and Diosdado told them that he (Sofronio) was only his visitor, but when Diosdado was arrested, he went along with him to give him company. 


Unfortunately, while in the municipal building, he was detained. He learned later that he was detained because of the robbery that was committed at the house of Mesario the night before. 


Finally, he Identified in court the certificate issued by the Clerk of Court of the City Court of Butuan to the effect that he had criminal record (Exhibit '2'), another certificate issued by the Court of First Instance of Butuan, Exhibit '3', the certification of the Butuan City Police Force, Exhibit '4', and Exhibit '5', that of the Vice-Mayor to the effect that he had no police record whatsoever. 


On cross-examination, he testified that he did not report to the police authorities the purpose of his trip to Baybay; that he did not look for his daughter even up to the time of his arrest because he was concerned about the death of his neighbor who was the father-in-law of Barbara. As a matter of fact, the only thing he did was to inquire from a store owner in Palm about his daughter, but did not in any manner ask the help of the local police authorities in looking for her. 


He also stated that he did not even tell the barrio officials that he was looking for his daughter although his only purpose in coming to Baybay was to follow her. 
4






His wife, Fidela Bengato Pegares, corroborated his testimony that he went to Baybay, Leyte, to look for their missing daughter, Conchita, whom they thought had eloped with Diosdado Alvarado. Fidela Identified the certifications issued by the police authorities in Butuan City, the Clerk of the City Court of Butuan, the Vice-Mayor of the City and the Court of First Instance of Agusan to the effect that her husband, Sofronio Pegares, has no criminal record. 
5


We have examined the records of the case with great care and find no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the trial court that the appellants are guilty of the offense complained of. The testimony of the prosecution witnesses are clear, precise, positive, and straightforward and include minute details consistent with human nature and experience. There cannot be any doubt as to their ability to Identify the culprits as the place was well illuminated and the accused were familiar to them. Besides, there is no showing, much less, a hint, of any evil motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses to testify falsely against them. They bore them no grudges nor ill-will. They would not have imputed to the appellants the commission of such a grave offense of Robbery with Rape if it were not true that the were really innocent thereof. 


Moreover, the testimony of the appellants are not convincing. Thus, Sofronio Pegares testified that he went to Baybay, Leyte, solely for the purpose of looking for a missing daughter. But, his matter-of-fact manner of conducting the search makes his claim incredible and appear absurdly inept and false and especially concocted to escape penal liability. As the trial court stated, Sofronio Pegares admitted that he did not look for his daughter outside Palhi when, as a matter of fact, his only purpose in coming to Baybay was to follow her, and the only thing he did was ""to inquire her whereabouts from a store owner in the barrio, because he was deeply concerned about the death of Roman Jaca, the father-in-law of Barbara Alvarado, in whose house he was then staying up to the time of his arrest;"" and ""did not even seek the help of the barrio officials and the local police authorities if only to assist him in looking for her. 


The appellant, Justiniano Oracion, for his part, declared that he was running a ""
hantak
"" game (
cara y cruz
) until 2:00 o'clock in the morning of February 6, 1967 and went to the store of Margarita Barrientos together with Alfredo Viterbo, Agripino Escuadra, and Primitivo Ybañez, Jr., where they stayed drinking up to about 3:00 o'clock in the morning. And yet, he did not present any of these persons if only to corroborate his testimony. 


At any rate, it was not impossible for the appellants to be at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed since Barrio Biasong is only 2 kilometers away from Barrio Palhi and could be negotiated in an hour's time by walking. It was possible for the appellants to have gone to Barrio Biasong and rob Alfonso Mesario and go back to whatever they were doing without being missed. 


The appellants assail the trial court for giving credence to the testimony of Flora Prado, claiming that while the said Flora Prado is acquainted with Justiniano Oracion since she used to see him during Sundays in the company of Damian Meredores, yet, she did not ""tell the police that one of the alleged robbers who abused her was a man whom he saw one Sunday with Damian Meredores. 
6
 


The contention is utterly devoid of merit. While it may be true that Flora Prado was asked during the investigation if she knew the robber who brought her to the kitchen and abused her and she answered that she did not know him, 
7
 she could not have had Justiniano Oracion in mind because it was Salazar Aragon who violated her in the kitchen of the house of Alfonso Mesario. The appellant Justiniano Oracion is accused of having raped Magdalena Arejola, not Flora Prado, and Magdalena positively Identified him as the one who raped her."" 
8
 


The trial court correctly imposed the penalty of the 
reclusion perpetua
 upon appellant Justiniano Oracion, the same being the maximum penalty for the crime of Robbery with Rape, as defined and penalized in par. 2, Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code, but erred in sentencing the said appellant to suffer three (3) separate indeterminate penalties, one for each of the injuries sustained by Dionisia Saladores, Simeon Mesario, and Celerina Saladores by reason of the robbery, since the offense committed is a complex crime penalized with a single penalty. 
9
 The physical injuries sustained by the victims of the robbery are but aggravating circumstances that would justify the imposition of the maximum period of the imposable penalty. Consequently, the three (3) separate indeterminate penalties imposed upon Justiniano Oracion should be eliminated. 


The trial court, likewise, erred in imposing three (3) separate indeterminate penalties upon the appellant Sofronio Pegares, one for each of the injuries sustained by Dionisia Saladores, Simeon Mesario, and Celerina Saladores in the course of the robbery. The offense committed by Sofronio Pegares is robbery with violence against persons as defined in par. 5, Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code and penalized by 
prision correccional
 in its maximum period to 
prision mayor
 in its medium period, as maximum. But since the crime was committed by a band, the maximum period of the penalty should be imposed upon him, pursuant to Art. 295 of the Revised Penal Code. Only one (1) penalty should be imposed upon the offender. The law does not authorize the imposition of a separate penalty for the injuries inflicted upon persons in the course of the robbery since the physical injuries suffered by them are but the overt manifestations of the violence employed and are inherent in the crime of robbery with violence against persons. For this reason, only one (1) penalty should be imposed upon the appellant Sofronio Pegares. 


WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from should be, as it is hereby, MODIFIED, as follows:


1. 	
Justiniano Oracion
 is found guilty of the crime of Robbery with Rape, as defined and penalized in par. 2, Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
; to indemnify the offended party, Magdalena Arejola, in the amount of P20,000.00; and to pay proportionate part of the costs; 


2.	
Sofronio Pegares
 is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery in Band, as defined and penalized under par. 5 of Art. 294, in relation to Arts. 295 and 296 of the Revised Penal Code, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of from two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
prision correccional 
as minimum, to eight (8) years of 
prision mayor
, as maximum; and to pay proportionate part of the costs. Considering that the said accused had been a detention prisoner since 1968, for a period of more than fifteen (15) years, he should be forthwith released from prison unless there be any other cause why he should continue to be detained; and 


3. 	Appellants 
Justiniano Oracion
 and 
Sofronio Pegares
 are further sentenced to pay, jointly and severally, with their co-accused the amounts of P4,500.00 and P8,200.00 to Dionisia Saladores and Celerina Saladores, respectively.
