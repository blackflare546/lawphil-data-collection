CONCEPCION, JR., 
J.:


In Criminal Case No. 2254 of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur, Abdula Bernardo, Bangon Tanog, Datu Mohamad, Ogka Moro, and several John Does were charged with the crime of Robbery in Band with Double Homicide and Frustrated Homicide committed, as follows: 






That on October 29, 1962, at about 4:00 P.M., more or less, in Sitio Tangalan, Barrio of Cawayan, Municipality of Alicia, Province of Zamboanga del Sur, Republic of the Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, together with the other John Does who are still at large more than four of whom had firearms of different calibers and bladed weapons, conspiring, confederating and assisting one another, and with intent to gain by the use of force upon things and violence and intimidation against persons, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and criminally assault and raid the said sitio of Tangalan with the use of their firearms and bladed weapons, killing Marcelo Tan 
alias
 Marcelo Kee and Pedro Fernandez and wounding Tomas Calamba as a result thereof, and thereafter, took and carried away cash in the amount of Nine Hundred Fifty (P950.00) Pesos, one rifle caliber 22 Squibman Serial No. 37564 worth Three Hundred Fifty (P350.00) Pesos, two men watches worth Seventy Four (P74.00) Pesos, one gold bracelet worth Fifty (P50.00) Pesos and various goods worth Two Hundred (P200.00) Pesos, belonging to said Ignacia Soria and thereafter, entered the house of Cirilo Payapaya and took one transistor radio (Sony) Serial No. 56552 worth Two Hundred (P200.00) Pesos and at the same time entered the house of Norma de Dumapat taking from her the amount of Three Hundred (P300.00) Pesos in cash, which make the total amount of Two Thousand One Hundred Twenty Four (P2,124.00) Pesos; to the damage and prejudice of the owners thereof. 






Trial was held jointly and judgment was rendered on the case on March 11, 1967, whereby the said accused were sentenced, under the charge aforesaid, to suffer the death penalty and to pay jointly and severally the amount of P6,000.00 to the heirs of Marcelo Tan and another P6,000.00 to the heirs of Pedro Fernandez. When the aforesaid judgment was promulgated, however, only two accused, namely: Bangon Tanog and Datu Mohamad, were present since the accused Abdula Bernardo had died while in confinement, and the other accused Ogka Buhisan 
alias
 Ogka Moro jumped bail and has remained at large up to the present.

 Subsequently, thereafter, the accused Datu Mohamad also died at the New Bilibid Prison Hospital on October 13, 1979,

 and the Court dismissed his appeal insofar as his criminal liability is concerned.

The inculpatory facts of the case are as follows: 






The evidence for the prosecution has satisfactorily established that at about 4:00 o'clock on the afternoon of October 29, 1962, a band of muslims, more than ten (10) in number, each one of whom was armed with either a carbine, a pistol, a shotgun, or a bladed weapon, arrived in four vintas at Sitio Tangalan, Barrio Cawayan, Municipality of Alicia, Zamboanga del Sur, and swooped down upon the hapless inhabitants of the locality. Once ashore, these marauders from the sea went on a rampage sending the unwary victims, men and women alike, scampering for safety, and seeking refuge in every nook and cranny. Some of the marauders entered the house of Ignacia Soria and, at gunpoint appropriated from her P 950.00 cash, one Squibman Rifle worth P 350.00 and several unsewed clothings worth P 200.00. Immediately thereafter, the same group entered the store of Wee Kee and shot and killed Marcelo Tan (Exhibits 'A' and 'A-l') and Pedro Fernandez (Exhibits 'B' and 'B-1'), and also shot and wounded Tomas Calamba (Exhibit 'C'). A part of the group of marauders armed with carbines also went up the house of Norma Dumapat and at gun point also extorted from her P 300.00. 


During the brief moment that the marauders were in Tangalan, looting, plundering, pillaging and killing, the panic-stricken inhabitants could only cringe with fear and abject surrender. When they finally went away, they left in their wake a pall of gloom and the gory cadavers of Marcelo Tan and Pedro Fernandez. 


Four of the marauders namely, Abdula Bernardo, Tangon Tanog, Datu Mohamad, and Ogka Moro alias Ogka Buhisan were definitely Identified by some residents of the sitio who had known them long before the commission of the offense. 






Able counsel appointed for the accused contends that the trial court erred in finding the accused Bangon Tanog and Datu Mohamad guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime for which they are charged. 


The Court finds the appeal well taken. To begin with, there is no evidence whatsoever that would show that the accused Datu Mohamad had participated in the commission of the crime complained of. The only evidence that would incriminate him is contained in the affidavit of Marcela de Bungcaras wherein she stated that the said Datu Mohamad was one of the malefactors who went to their house and demanded money from her.

 However, Marcela de Bungcaras 
never
 testified as a witness. Since the findings of facts and the judgment must rest only and strictly on the evidence tendered, the accused Datu Mohamad should be absolved from liability, both criminal and civil. 


The evidence presented against the accused Bangon Tanog, consisting of the sole testimony of Ildefonso Berbesada, is, likewise, insufficient to prove the guilt of the said accused beyond reasonable doubt. Ildefonso Berbesada merely testified that he saw Bangon Tanog on board his vinta, sailing towards the landing of Iman Samat Medel, while he, Berbesada, was hiding at the base of a tree in a mangrove swamp. But, Berbesada did not testify, nor is there corroborative or similar testimony, that the accused Bangon Tanog anchored at the landing and joined in the rapine and pillage of the sitio. The testimony of Ildefonso Berbesada reads, as follows:

A 	After the shouts: 'Bandits, bandits' and more or less one- half hour after I saw these vintas. 


ATTY. BERSALES: 


	That is all for the witness.

That single circumstance of having been seen sailing towards the landing or wharf of Imam Samat Medel, even if true, is not sufficient to prove conspiracy. To warrant a conviction in criminal cases upon circumstantial evidence, such evidence must be more than one, derived from facts duly proven, and the combination of all of them must be such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt.
