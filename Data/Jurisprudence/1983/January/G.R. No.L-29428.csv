CONFORME:

(Plaintiff)


(Sgd.) ROSENDO DE LEON

(Defendant)










From the foregoing stipulation of facts, it appears that one Felicio Cadenas applied with the Land Tenure Administration (now Land Authority) for the purcdhase of a parcel of land Identified as Lot No.l 10, Block 3 of the Fabie Estate, in Paco, Manila. The application was approved and an agreement to sell was issued on December 28, 1960.


On January 3, 1961, Cadenas transferred his rights over the said parcel of land in favor of plaintiff Alejandro Diño, However, the Deed of Transfer in favor of Dibi was not immediately approved by the Land Tenure Administration pending payment in full of the purchase price.


In the meantime, on February 11, 1963, Magat transferred his rights in favor of herein defendant-appellee, Rosendo de Leon, who paid in full the purchase price.


On September 18, 1963, the Deed of Transfer in favor of de Leon was approved by the Land Tenure Administration.


On October 30, 1963, the Land Authority executed a deed of absolute sale of subject property in favor of Rosendo de Leon and, on December 3, 1963, the Register of Deeds of manila issued Transfer Certificate of Title No. 73369 in his favor. Thereafter, de Leon applied for a loan from the Social Security System. As a security, he mortgaged the land in question after having secured the permission of the Land Authority.


On February 28, 1964, plaintiff-appellant Alejandro Diño paid in full the purchase price of the same lot but, when the Deed of Sale was about to be issued to him, the Land Authority came to know that the same had already been sold to Rosendo de Leon and to whom a Transfer Certificate of Title had already been issued.


Governor Conrado Estrella of the Land Authority ordered an investigation of the case, following which a decision was rendered, the dispositive portion of which reads:


Wherefore, the Judicial Cases Division is hereby directed to file the necessary petition in court leading to the cancellation of the deed of sale issued on December (sic) 30, 1963, for the lot in question in favor of Rosendo de Leon and to the cancellation of the transfer certificate of title issued to said Mr. de leon for the said lot. (pp. 60-61, Record on Appeal).


On May 21, 1968, the lower court rendered judgment, as follows:






IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court renders judgment absolving the defendants from the complaint. For lack of evidence, it not appearing that the plaintiff Alejandro Diño had filed this action maliciously, the co8unterclaim of the defendant Rosendo de Leon is dismissed. Without pronouncement as to costs. (p. 62, Record on Appeal).






Dissatisfied with the foregoing judgment, plaintiffs appealed to this Court on the following assignment of errors:






				I


THE DECESION OF THE LOWER COURTS IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND JUDICIAL PRECEDENTS.


				II


THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT APPELALNT ALEJANDRO DIÑO NOT ACQUIRE ANY DOMINICAL RIGHT ON THE LOT IN QUESTION.


				III


THE LOWER COURT FURTHER ERRED IN ADJUDGING THE APPELALNT LAND AUTHORITY HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE PROPERTY FROM THE EXECUTIOLN OF THE DEED OF SALE AFORESTATED AND MORE SO AFTER ISSUANCE OF SAOD TRANSFER CERTIFICATE OF TITLE IN THE NAME OF DEFENDANT-APPELLEE.






We agree with the finding of the lower court that ""contrary to the statement contatined in the decision of Governor Estrella that there was in this case a double sale, the Court finds no such double sale. On the date the lot was sold to Rosendo de Leon, there was no sale made to plaintiff Alejandro Diño, although the deed of transfer of rights from Cadeans to Diño was approved by the land Authority. The records of this case fail to show any bad faith or false representation made by the defendant Rosendo de Leon. His application and deed of transfer of rights were approved by the Land Authority in the ordinary course of business; the deed of sale was executed in his favor at the time when the deed of transfer of rights executed by Cadenas in favor of plaintiff Diño was still pending approval by the Land Authorit. When, therefore, the deed of sale was executed by the Land Authority in favor of Rosendo de Leon, plaintiff Alejandro Diño had not acquired any dominical right on the lot in question. (pp. 61-62, Record on Appeal).


It was on October 30, 1963 when the Land Authority executed a deed of sale in favor of defendant-appellee Rosendo de Leon. On December 3, 1963, the transfer certificate of title was issued in his favor. At that time, the deed of transfer of rights executed by Cadenas inh favor of plaintiff Alejandro Diño was not yet approved by the Land Authority. It cannot be said, therefore, that plaintiff Diño was already the owner of the property. What he had then, if any, were only the rights of Felicio Cadenas, subject to the approval of the Land Authority.


Indeed, it cannot be said that this is one of double sale because after the Land Authority had sold the property to de Leon, it did not anymore execute one in favor of Diño.


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED, with the modification that the Land Authority is hereby ordered to refund the purchase price of P814.99 to plaintiff Alejandro Diño. Without costs.


SO ORDERED.
