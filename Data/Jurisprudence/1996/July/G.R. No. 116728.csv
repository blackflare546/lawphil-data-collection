G.R. No. 116728	July 17, 1996


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, 
plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


RODELIO CRUZ y SAN JOSE, 
accused-appellant.


 


PUNO, 
J.:
p


Accused-appellant Rodelio Cruz appeals from a judgment of conviction
1
 meted out to him by the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo, Rizal for raping his twelve year old niece, Mary Jane Alonzo.


In a Complaint
2
 dated October 30, 1991, Mary Jane Alonzo charged accused-appellant with the crime of rape committed as follows:






That on or about the 25th day of April, 1991, in the Municipality of Taytay, province of Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs (
sic
) and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with twelve (12) year old girl, Mary Jane Alonzo y Cruz, without her consent and against her will.






CONTRARY TO LAW.


Accused-appellant pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charge.
3




The evidence for the prosecution shows that accused-appellant is the brother of Mary Jane's mother, Belinda Alonzo.
4


 He lives at the house adjoining the Alonzos' dwelling in Elwood Street, Taytay, Rizal.
5
 On April 25, 1991, around three o'clock in the afternoon, Mary Jane was about to take a bath, when accused-appellant entered the bathroom of the Alonzos located at the back of their house. Accused-appellant entered through the side of the bathroom which was covered only by jute sack. Once inside, accused-appellant took off his clothes and forcibly undressed Mary Jane. Mary Jane tried to run but accused-appellant blocked her way and forced her to lie down. Then, he mounted her and tried to have sexual intercourse with her.
6
 By stroke of fate, Mary Jane's brother, Roberto Alonzo, passed by the bathroom and saw accused-appellant lying on top of her. Accused-appellant saw Roberto, hurriedly put on his clothes and rushed to their house. Roberto pursued accused-appellant and challenged him to a fight.
7
 Later that night, Roberto revealed the incident to their father, Juanito Alonzo. The following day, April 26, 1991, Juanito accompanied Mary Jane to the police station where she executed a sworn statement.
8
 Mary Jane alleged in her sworn statement that accused-appellant deflowered her for the first time in 1988 when she was only nine years old. This was followed by several more assaults, the last of which happened on April 25, 1991 when she was already twelve years old.
9
 The medical examination conducted by Dr. Vlademir Villaseñor, medico-legal officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory, disclosed the presence of deep healed lacerations in Mary Jane's genitalia, showing that she has had sexual experience in the past.
10


For his defense, accused-appellant denied forcing any sexual intercourse with Mary Jane on April 25, 1991. He claimed that at the time when the alleged rape was committed, he was at the factory of High Grades Packaging Product located at Libid, Kay Tikling, Taytay, Rizal where he worked as machine operator. He went home at four o'clock in the afternoon. Upon reaching their house, he rested for a few minutes, and then went to the bathroom to freshen himself. Their bathroom is located at the back of their house, beside the bathroom of the Alonzos. While in the bathroom, he heard a rustling sound. He peeped through a hole on the wall to determine its source, and saw Mary Jane bathing at the back of their bathroom. Surprised, he immediately covered the hole and continued to wash himself. Moments later, he heard somebody calling his name. It turned out to be Roberto, Mary Jane's brother, who accused him of peeping at Mary Jane.
11


The trial court found the accused guilty as charged. Accused was sentenced as follows:






WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Rodelio Cruz y San Jose GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined and penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer and undergo imprisonment of 
reclusion perpetua
, to pay the complaining witness the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages and to pay the costs.


In the service of his sentence he shall be credited with the full benefits of the preventive imprisonment undergone by him, pursuant to Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 6127, if he voluntarily agrees in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.


SO ORDERED. 
12






In this appeal, accused-appellant faults the trial court for finding him guilty of the crime of rape and for giving weight and credence to the improbable and inconsistent testimony of Mary Jane.
13


We disagree with the trial court's conclusion that accused-appellant is guilty of consummated rape. It appears from the records that accused-appellant did not succeed in having sexual intercourse with Mary Jane on April 25, 1991 because her brother happened to pass by the scene of the crime just when accused-appellant was about to ravish her. Mary Jane admitted on several occasions that accused-appellant was unable to consummate the act of rape.
14


In the earlier part of her direct testimony, Mary Jane gave a detailed account of how accused-appellant violated her:

It is clear from Mary Jane's testimony that accused-appellant succeeded in raping her in the past, but not on April 25, 1991. Accused-appellant cannot be convicted for consummated rape on the basis of such evidence as the complaint specifically refers to the offense committed on April 25, 1991. Due process demands that the accused in a criminal case should be informed of the nature of the offense with which he is charged before he is put on trial. To convict him for an offense not alleged in the complaint or information will violate such right.
20


Considering the evidence presented, we find the accused-appellant guilty of attempted rape. Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:


1.	By using force or intimidation;


2.	When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and


3.	When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented. 
21




In the case at bar, there was no carnal knowledge although accused-appellant has commenced the commission of the offense by overt acts. Her surreptitiously entered the bathroom when Mary Jane was about to take a bath. He removed his clothes, afterwhich he started to disrobe Mary Jane. The intention of accused-appellant is obvious. The circumstances show that he had nothing in mind at that time but to satisfy his carnal desire. If it were not for the timely intervention of Mary Jane's brother, accused-appellant would have again consummated his lust against Mary Jane's will.




IN VIEW WHEREOF, the appealed judgment is MODIFIED. Accused-appellant Rodelio Cruz y San Jose is hereby declared GUILTY of ATTEMPTED RAPE. He is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from six (6) years of
 prision correccional
 as minimum to ten (10) years of
 prision mayor
 as maximum and to pay the offended party the sum of P30,000.00 as civil indemnity.

SO ORDERED.
