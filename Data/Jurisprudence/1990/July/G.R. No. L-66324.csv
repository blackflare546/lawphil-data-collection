This is an appeal interposed by accused Alfredo Cempron who was convicted of the crime of Murder by the Regional Trial Court of Bohol, 
1
 Branch 3, for stabbing to death one Gregorio Gudelusao on November 1, 1982. The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision reads:






WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Alfredo Cempron guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder penalized under Articles No. 248 of the Revised Penal Code and there being no aggravating circumstance nor mitigating circumstance alleged in the information, the Court hereby sentences accused Alfredo Cempron to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of

It appearing from the record that the accused voluntarily surrendered on November 1, 1982 in the Inabanga police authorities and was confined at the Inabanga Municipal Jail since then and was transferred to the Bohol Rehabilitation Center, Tagbilaran City on January 3, 1983 and had been under preventive imprisonment since then and until at present and it appearing from the record that he reduced into writing his conformity and intention to abide by the rules and regulations applicable to convicts, is given 4/5 credit of his preventive imprisonment at the Inabanga Municipal Jail and full credit of his preventive imprisonment that he had already undergone at the Bohol Rehabilitation Center since January 3, 1983 and until at present, pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 6127.


The weapon marked Exhibit A is ordered confiscated in favor of the government. (pp. 9-10, Judgment; pp. 162-163, 
Rollo
)






The facts as summarized by the Solicitor General are as follows:






At or about 3:30 o'clock in the afternoon of November 1982 (tsn, March 24, 1983, p. 2; tsn, May 19, 1983, p. 26), Gregorio Gudelusao was in a cockpit in Cogon, Inabanga, Bohol, where cockfights were currently going on (tsn, May 19, 1983, p. 26). Gudelusao was a ""mananari"", or a person who placed gaffs on fighting cocks (
ibid
.).


As Gudelusao was squatting on the ground counting money consisting of bets of different persons (
id
; tsn, March 24, 1983, p. 2), appellant suddenly came from behind him (tsn, May 19, 1983, p. 26; March 24, 1983, p. 2; August 8, 1983, p. 34) holding a fighting cock on the left hand with a knife (Exh. A) concealed beneath the wings of the cock (tsn, August 8, 1983, p. 35). Thereafter, appellant successively stabbed Gudelusao who was totally unprepared for the attack (tsn, March 24, 1983, p. 4; tsn, May 19, 1983, p. 27). After being stabbed several times, Gudelusao fell to the ground (tsn, May 19, 1983, p. 27), with his intestines already exposed (
Ibid
., p. 28). Meanwhile, appellant ran away still holding his knife (Exh. A) (
id
; tan, March 24, 1983, pp. 4-5).


Thereafter, Humberto Gudelusao a brother of the victim, rushed the latter to the Clarin Emergency Hospital. Later, Gudelusao was transferred to the Bohol General Hospital (tsn, March 24, 1983, p. 5; tsn, May 19, 1983, p. 28) where Dr. David Indino treated the victim (tsn, May 19, 1983, p. 16).
i•t•c-aüsl 
 Unfortunately, however, Gudelusao died at about 8:30 o'clock that same evening due to massive blood loss (
ibid
., p. 17). Dr. Indino executed a Certificate of Death (Exh. C) attesting to Gudelusao's death (
id
., pp. 17-18).


At about 7:00 o'clock in the evening of the same day, appellant voluntarily surrendered to Agripino Lofranco, a Barangay Officer of Luyo, Inabanga, Bohol, and the knife (Exh. A) he used in stabbing Gudelusao (tsn, June 6, 1983, pp. 1-3). Thereafter, Lofranco and a certain Patrolman Torreon brought appellant to the police station (
ibid
., pp. 3-5). They gave the knife (Exh. A) to the Administrative Officer for safekeeping (
id
., p. 9).


Patrolman Torreon entered the stabbing incident in the police blotter (Exh. B) (
id
, p. 3-4).


It is undisputed that appellant is responsible for Gregorio Gudelusao's death. By this appeal, however, appellant maintains that the prosecution failed to establish, by positive evidence, circumstances which qualify the criminal act to Murder. He avers that he stabbed Gudelusao merely in self-defense. Hence, or he should be convicted merely of Homicide, and not Murder, as found by the trial court. (pp. 3-6, Brief for the plaintiff-appellee, p. 170, 
Rollo
)






The trial court's decision convicting appellant Cempron of Murder was premised on the qualifying circumstance of Treachery. For 
alevosia
 or treachery to be appreciated as an aggravating or qualifying circumstance, the offender should have employed means, methods or forms in the execution of the crime which tended directly and specifically to insure its execution without any risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.

On his part, Alfredo Cempron testified that






On November 1, 1982, at about 12:00 o'clock noon, he was already at the cockpit to bet. The cockfight had started at 11:00 o'clock in the morning. He bet once only and he won. The deceased received his (accused's) bet of P10.00, the former being the collector (""
tenedor""
). The deceased was a gaffer and at the same time, a bet collector. After winning, he asked the money he won from the deceased. But the deceased said to him, ""You did not give anything to me."" He insisted in asking the amount that he won. The deceased got angry and boxed him hitting him in the abdomen. It was 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon when he was boxed by the deceased. He felt the pain and walked away. The deceased is robust and a big man while he is very thin and weak. Thereafter, he went towards the nearby restaurant and got a kitchen knife for self-protection. Then, he proceeded to the deceased reiterating his demand for the bet that he had allegedly won. The deceased got something from his pocket and the accused thought that it was the money he won. But it turned out to be a ""
tari
"" (gaff). The deceased told him that this (""
tari
"") will be the one he would give the accused. Then, the deceased thrusted that gaff towards his body. Fortunately, he was able to evade said thrust. He got his knife and thrusted it against the deceased's body. There were many persons when he stabbed the deceased. He stabbed the deceased only in self-defense. He did not stab the deceased while the latter was squatting. He did not stab the deceased from behind. He did not stab the deceased because the latter testified before the Fiscal that he (accused) gave his knife to one Catalino Luga to kill the son of Luz Gudito. He stabbed the deceased just once in the left abdomen. After stabbing the deceased, he ran towards the barangay councilman of Luyo in order to surrender. He did not surrender directly to the police for fear of being mauled. He has no other case. (pp. 148-149, 
Rollo
)






In the case at bar, the records show that the deceased was inside the cockpit and in a squatting position counting the bettors' money when suddenly, appellant, holding a knife which was concealed under a cock's wing, and while passing behind the deceased, stabbed the latter on different parts of the body. These facts are clearly established by the testimonies of Humberto Gudelusao and Severina Gudez in open court, thus:

(tsn, May 19, 1983, pp. 26-27)










The foregoing appears that the mode of attack adopted by appellant insured the accomplishment of his purpose without risk to himself. The trial court therefore correctly applied the qualifying circumstance of treachery.


Appellant alleges that the trial court erred in imposing the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.


He is correct. The trial court failed to consider one (1) mitigating circumstance, that is, voluntary surrender.


Prosecution witness Agripino Lofranco, a barangay official in the place of the stabbing incident, positively testified that in the same evening of said incident appellant purposely went to him and sought his help in surrendering to the police authorities and he actually turned over appellant to them. In fact, the trial court made this finding: ""The testimony of Agripino Lofranco for the prosecution was also given weight and credence by this Court that Alfredo Cempron surrendered to him after the stabbing incident and delivered to him the weapon marked Exhibit A."" (p. 161, 
Rollo
) Consequently, appellant should be credited the mitigating circumstance of ""voluntary surrender.""


The penalty for murder is 
reclusion temporal
 maximum to death. Considering the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, the imposable penalty would be the minimum period of the penalty provided for by law which has a range of 17 years 4 months and 1 day to 20 years. In crimes punishable with death or life imprisonment provided the resulting penalty, after considering the attending circumstances, is 
reclusion temporal 
or less, the Indeterminate Sentence Law applies. (Aquino, 1 Revised Penal Code 724,1987 edition).


Applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum range of the indeterminate sentence is 10 years 1 day to 17 years 4 months and the maximum range is 17 years 4 months 1 day to 20 years.


PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED as follows: Alfredo Cempron is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, but the penalty, applying the indeterminate sentence law, to be imposed shall be from ten (10) years and one (1) day of
 prision mayor
 to eighteen (18) years and one (1) day of 
reclusion
 
temporal
 as maximum and the indemnity is increased to thirty thousand pesos (P30,000.00) in line with the prevailing jurisprudence.


SO ORDERED.
