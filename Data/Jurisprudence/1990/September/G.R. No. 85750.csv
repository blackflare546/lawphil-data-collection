MELENCIO-HERRERA, 
J.:


Consolidated on 11 December 1989, these two cases involve the validity of the claim of immunity by the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) and the International Rice Research Institute, Inc. (IRRI) from the application of Philippine labor laws.




I


Facts and Issues


A.	G.R. No. 85750 — 
the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Case
.




As an aftermath of the Vietnam War, the plight of Vietnamese refugees fleeing from South Vietnam's communist rule confronted the international community.


In response to this crisis, on 23 February 1981, an Agreement was forged between the Philippine Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees whereby an operating center for processing Indo-Chinese refugees for eventual resettlement to other countries was to be established in Bataan (Annex ""A"", 
Rollo
, pp. 22-32).


ICMC was one of those accredited by the Philippine Government to operate the refugee processing center in Morong, Bataan. It was incorporated in New York, USA, at the request of the Holy See, as a non-profit agency involved in international humanitarian and voluntary work. It is duly registered with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and enjoys Consultative Status, Category II. As an international organization rendering voluntary and humanitarian services in the Philippines, its activities are parallel to those of the International Committee for Migration (ICM) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) [DOLE Records of BLR Case No. A-2-62-87, 
ICMC v. Calleja
, Vol. 1].


On 14 July 1986, Trade Unions of the Philippines and Allied Services (TUPAS) filed with the then Ministry of Labor and Employment a Petition for Certification Election among the rank and file members employed by ICMC The latter opposed the petition on the ground that it is an international organization registered with the United Nations and, hence, enjoys diplomatic immunity.


On 5 February 1987, Med-Arbiter Anastacio L. Bactin sustained ICMC and dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.


On appeal by TUPAS, Director Pura Calleja of the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR), reversed the Med-Arbiter's Decision and ordered the immediate conduct of a certification election. At that time, ICMC's request for recognition as a specialized agency was still pending with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DEFORAF).


Subsequently, however, on 15 July 1988, the Philippine Government, through the DEFORAF, granted ICMC the status of a specialized agency with corresponding diplomatic privileges and immunities, as evidenced by a Memorandum of Agreement between the Government and ICMC (Annex ""E"", Petition, 
Rollo
, pp. 41-43), 
infra
.


ICMC then sought the immediate dismissal of the TUPAS Petition for Certification Election invoking the immunity expressly granted but the same was denied by respondent BLR Director who, again, ordered the immediate conduct of a pre-election conference. ICMC's two Motions for Reconsideration were denied despite an opinion rendered by DEFORAF on 17 October 1988 that said BLR Order violated ICMC's diplomatic immunity.


Thus, on 24 November 1988, ICMC filed the present Petition for C
ertiorari 
with Preliminary Injunction assailing the BLR Order.


On 28 November 1988, the Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the holding of the certification election.


On 10 January 1989, the DEFORAF, through its Legal Adviser, retired Justice Jorge C. Coquia of the Court of Appeals, filed a Motion for Intervention alleging that, as the highest executive department with the competence and authority to act on matters involving diplomatic immunity and privileges, and tasked with the conduct of Philippine diplomatic and consular relations with foreign governments and UN organizations, it has a legal interest in the outcome of this case.


Over the opposition of the Solicitor General, the Court allowed DEFORAF intervention.


On 12 July 1989, the Second Division gave due course to the ICMC Petition and required the submittal of memoranda by the parties, which has been complied with.


As initially stated, the issue is whether or not the grant of diplomatic privileges and immunites to ICMC extends to immunity from the application of Philippine labor laws.


ICMC sustains the affirmative of the proposition citing (1) its Memorandum of Agreement with the Philippine Government giving it the status of a specialized agency, (
infra
); (2) the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of Specialized Agencies, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 21 November 1947 and concurred in by the Philippine Senate through Resolution No. 91 on 17 May 1949 (the Philippine Instrument of Ratification was signed by the President on 30 August 1949 and deposited with the UN on 20 March 1950) 
infra
; and (3) Article II, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution, which declares that the Philippines adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land.


Intervenor DEFORAF upholds ICMC'S claim of diplomatic immunity and seeks an affirmance of the DEFORAF determination that the BLR Order for a certification election among the ICMC employees is violative of the diplomatic immunity of said organization.


Respondent BLR Director, on the other hand, with whom the Solicitor General agrees, cites State policy and Philippine labor laws to justify its assailed Order, particularly, Article II, Section 18 and Article III, Section 8 of the 1987 Constitution, 
infra
; and Articles 243 and 246 of the Labor Code, as amended, i
bid
. In addition, she contends that a certification election is not a litigation but a mere investigation of a non-adversary, fact-finding character. It is not a suit against ICMC its property, funds or assets, but is the sole concern of the workers themselves.


B.	G.R. No. 89331 — 
(The International Rice Research Institute [IRRI] Case).


Before a Decision could be rendered in the ICMC Case, the Third Division, on 11 December 1989, resolved to consolidate G.R. No. 89331 pending before it with G.R. No. 85750, the lower-numbered case pending with the Second Division, upon manifestation by the Solicitor General that both cases involve similar issues.


The facts disclose that on 9 December 1959, the Philippine Government and the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) at Los Baños, Laguna. It was intended to be an autonomous, philanthropic, tax-free, non-profit, non-stock organization designed to carry out the principal objective of conducting ""basic research on the rice plant, on all phases of rice production, management, distribution and utilization with a view to attaining nutritive and economic advantage or benefit for the people of Asia and other major rice-growing areas through improvement in quality and quantity of rice.""


Initially, IRRI was organized and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a private corporation subject to all laws and regulations. However, by virtue of Pres. Decree No. 1620, promulgated on 19 April 1979, IRRI was granted the status, prerogatives, privileges and immunities of an international organization.


The Organized Labor Association in Line Industries and Agriculture (OLALIA), is a legitimate labor organization with an existing local union, the Kapisanan ng Manggagawa at TAC sa IRRI (Kapisanan, for short) in respondent IRRI.


On 20 April 1987, the Kapisanan filed a Petition for Direct Certification Election with Region IV, Regional Office of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).


IRRI opposed the petition invoking Pres. Decree No. 1620 conferring upon it the status of an international organization and granting it immunity from all civil, criminal and administrative proceedings under Philippine laws.


On 7 July 1987, Med-Arbiter Leonardo M. Garcia, upheld the opposition on the basis of Pres. Decree No. 1620 and dismissed the Petition for Direct Certification.


On appeal, the BLR Director, who is the public respondent in the ICMC Case, set aside the Med-Arbiter's Order and authorized the calling of a certification election among the rank-and-file employees of IRRI. Said Director relied on Article 243 of the Labor Code, as amended, 
infra
 and Article XIII, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution, 
1
 and held that ""the immunities and privileges granted to IRRI do not include exemption from coverage of our Labor Laws."" Reconsideration sought by IRRI was denied.


On appeal, the Secretary of Labor, in a Resolution of 5 July 1989, set aside the BLR Director's Order, dismissed the Petition for Certification Election, and held that the grant of specialized agency status by the Philippine Government to the IRRI bars DOLE from assuming and exercising jurisdiction over IRRI Said Resolution reads in part as follows:






Presidential Decree No. 1620 which grants to the IRRI the status, prerogatives, privileges and immunities of an international organization is clear and explicit. It provides in categorical terms that:


Art. 3 — The Institute shall enjoy immunity from any penal, civil and administrative proceedings, except insofar as immunity has been expressly waived by the Director-General of the Institution or his authorized representative.


Verily, unless and until the Institute expressly waives its immunity, no summons, subpoena, orders, decisions or proceedings ordered by any court or administrative or 
quasi-judicial
 agency are enforceable as against the Institute. In the case at bar there was no such waiver made by the Director-General of the Institute. Indeed, the Institute, at the very first opportunity already vehemently questioned the jurisdiction of this Department by filing an ex-parte motion to dismiss the case.






Hence, the present Petition for C
ertiorari 
filed by Kapisanan alleging grave abuse of discretion by respondent Secretary of Labor in upholding IRRI's diplomatic immunity.


The Third Division, to which the case was originally assigned, required the respondents to comment on the petition. In a Manifestation filed on 4 August 1990, the Secretary of Labor declared that it was 
""not adopting as his own"" 
the decision of the BLR Director in the ICMC Case as well as the Comment of the Solicitor General sustaining said Director. The last pleading was filed by IRRI on 14 August 1990.


Instead of a Comment, the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation and Motion praying that he be excused from filing a comment ""it appearing that in the earlier case of 
International Catholic Migration Commission v. Hon. Pura Calleja
, G.R. No. 85750. the Office of the Solicitor General had sustained the stand of Director Calleja on the very same issue now before it, which position has been superseded by respondent Secretary of Labor in G.R. No. 89331,"" the present case. The Court acceded to the Solicitor General's prayer.


The Court is now asked to rule upon whether or not the Secretary of Labor committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the Petition for Certification Election filed by Kapisanan.


Kapisanan contends that Article 3 of Pres. Decree No. 1620 granting IRRI the status, privileges, prerogatives and immunities of an international organization, invoked by the Secretary of Labor, is unconstitutional in so far as it deprives the Filipino workers of their fundamental and constitutional right to form trade unions for the purpose of collective bargaining as enshrined in the 1987 Constitution.


A procedural issue is also raised. Kapisanan faults respondent Secretary of Labor for entertaining IRRI'S appeal from the Order of the Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations directing the holding of a certification election. Kapisanan contends that pursuant to Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of Rule V 
2
 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, the Order of the BLR Director had become final and unappeable and that, therefore, the Secretary of Labor had no more jurisdiction over the said appeal.


On the other hand, in entertaining the appeal, the Secretary of Labor relied on Section 25 of Rep. Act. No. 6715, which took effect on 21 March 1989, providing for the direct filing of appeal from the Med-Arbiter to the Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment instead of to the Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations in cases involving certification election orders.




III


Findings in Both Cases
.




There can be no question that diplomatic immunity has, in fact, been granted ICMC and IRRI.


Article II of the Memorandum of Agreement between the Philippine Government and ICMC provides that ICMC shall have a status ""similar to that of a specialized agency."" Article III, Sections 4 and 5 of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of Specialized Agencies, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 21 November 1947 and concurred in by the Philippine Senate through Resolution No. 19 on 17 May 1949, explicitly provides:






Art. III, Section 4. The specialized agencies, their property and assets, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall 
enjoy immunity from every form of legal process
 except insofar as in any particular case they have expressly waived their immunity. It is, however, understood that no waiver of immunity shall extend to any measure of execution.


Sec. 5. — The premises of the specialized agencies shall be inviolable. The property and assets of the specialized agencies, wherever located and by whomsoever held shall be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation and any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial or legislative action. (Emphasis supplied).






IRRI is similarly situated, Pres. Decree No. 1620, Article 3, is explicit in its grant of immunity, thus:






Art. 3.	
Immunity from Legal Process
. — The Institute shall enjoy immunity from any penal, civil and administrative proceedings, except insofar as that immunity has been expressly waived by the Director-General of the Institute or his authorized representatives.






Thus it is that the DEFORAF, through its Legal Adviser, sustained ICMC'S invocation of immunity when in a Memorandum, dated 17 October 1988, it expressed the view that ""the Order of the Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations dated 21 September 1988 for the conduct of Certification Election within ICMC violates the diplomatic immunity of the organization."" Similarly, in respect of IRRI, the DEFORAF speaking through The Acting Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Jose D. Ingles, in a letter, dated 17 June 1987, to the Secretary of Labor, maintained that ""IRRI enjoys immunity from the jurisdiction of DOLE in this particular instance.""


The foregoing opinions constitute a categorical recognition by the Executive Branch of the Government that ICMC and IRRI enjoy immunities accorded to international organizations, which determination has been held to be a political question conclusive upon the Courts in order not to embarrass a political department of Government.






It is a recognized principle of international law and under our system of separation of powers that diplomatic immunity is essentially a political question and courts should refuse to look beyond a determination by the executive branch of the government, and where the plea of diplomatic immunity is recognized and affirmed by the executive branch of the government as in the case at bar, it is then the duty of the courts to accept the claim of immunity upon appropriate suggestion by the principal law officer of the government . . . or other officer acting under his direction. Hence, in adherence to the settled principle that courts may not so exercise their jurisdiction . . . as to embarrass the executive arm of the government in conducting foreign relations, it is accepted doctrine that in such cases the judicial department of (this) government follows the action of the political branch and will not embarrass the latter by assuming an antagonistic jurisdiction. 
3








A brief look into the nature of international organizations and specialized agencies is in order. The term ""international organization"" is generally used to describe an organization set up by agreement between two or more states. 
4


Under contemporary international law, such organizations are endowed with some degree of international legal personality 
5
 such that they are capable of exercising specific rights, duties and powers. 
6
 They are organized mainly as a means for conducting general international business in which the member states have an interest. 
7
 The United Nations, for instance, is an international organization dedicated to the propagation of world peace.


""Specialized agencies"" are international organizations having functions in particular fields. The term appears in Articles 57 
8
 and 63 
9
 
of the Charter of the United Nations:






The Charter, while it invests the United Nations with the general task of promoting progress and international cooperation in economic, social, health, cultural, educational and related matters, contemplates that these tasks will be mainly fulfilled not by organs of the United Nations itself but by autonomous international organizations established by inter-governmental agreements outside the United Nations. There are now many such international agencies having functions in many different fields, e.g. in posts, telecommunications, railways, canals, rivers, sea transport, civil aviation, meteorology, atomic energy, finance, trade, education and culture, health and refugees. Some are virtually world-wide in their membership, some are regional or otherwise limited in their membership. The Charter provides that those agencies which have ""wide international responsibilities"" are to be brought into relationship with the United Nations by agreements entered into between them and the Economic and Social Council, are then to be known as ""specialized agencies."" 
10






The rapid growth of international organizations under contemporary international law has paved the way for the development of the concept of international immunities.






It is now usual for the constitutions of international organizations to contain provisions conferring certain immunities on the organizations themselves, representatives of their member states and persons acting on behalf of the organizations. A series of conventions, agreements and protocols defining the immunities of various international organizations in relation to their members generally are now widely in force; . . . 
11






There are basically three propositions underlying the grant of international immunities to international organizations. These principles, contained in the ILO Memorandum are stated thus: 1) international institutions should have a status which protects them against control or interference by any one government in the performance of functions for the effective discharge of which they are responsible to democratically constituted international bodies in which all the nations concerned are represented; 2) no country should derive any national financial advantage by levying fiscal charges on common international funds; and 3) the international organization should, as a collectivity of States members, be accorded the facilities for the conduct of its official business customarily extended to each other by its individual member States. 
12
 The theory behind all three propositions is said to be essentially institutional in character. ""It is not concerned with the status, dignity or privileges of individuals, but with the elements of functional independence necessary to free international institutions from national control and to enable them to discharge their responsibilities impartially on behalf of all their members. 
13
 
The 
raison d'etre
 for these immunities is the assurance of unimpeded performance of their functions by the agencies concerned.


The grant of immunity from local jurisdiction to ICMC and IRRI is clearly necessitated by their international character and respective purposes. The objective is to avoid the danger of partiality and interference by the host country in their internal workings. The exercise of jurisdiction by the Department of Labor in these instances would defeat the very purpose of immunity, which is to shield the affairs of international organizations, in accordance with international practice, from political pressure or control by the host country to the prejudice of member States of the organization, and to ensure the unhampered performance of their functions.


ICMC's and IRRI's immunity from local jurisdiction by no means deprives labor of its basic rights, which are guaranteed by Article II, Section 18, 
14
 Article III, Section 8, 
15
 
and Article XIII, Section 3 (
supra
), of the 1987 Constitution; and implemented by Articles 243 and 246 of the Labor Code, 
16
 relied on by the BLR Director and by Kapisanan.


For, ICMC employees are not without recourse whenever there are disputes to be settled. Section 31 of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies of the United Nations 
17
 
provides that ""each specialized agency shall make provision for appropriate modes of settlement of: (a) disputes arising out of contracts or other disputes of private character to which the specialized agency is a party."" Moreover, pursuant to Article IV of the Memorandum of Agreement between ICMC the the Philippine Government, whenever there is any abuse of privilege by ICMC, the Government is free to withdraw the privileges and immunities accorded. Thus:






Art. IV.	
Cooperation with Government Authorities
. — 1. The Commission shall cooperate at all times with the appropriate authorities of the Government to ensure the observance of Philippine laws, rules and regulations, facilitate the proper administration of justice and prevent the occurrences of any abuse of the privileges and immunities granted its officials and alien employees in Article III of this Agreement to the Commission.


2.	In the event that the Government determines that there has been an abuse of the privileges and immunities granted under this Agreement, consultations shall be held between the Government and the Commission to determine whether any such abuse has occurred and, if so, the Government shall withdraw the privileges and immunities granted the Commission and its officials.






Neither are the employees of IRRI without remedy in case of dispute with management as, in fact, there had been organized a forum for better management-employee relationship as evidenced by the formation of the Council of IRRI Employees and Management (CIEM) wherein ""both management and employees were and still are represented for purposes of maintaining mutual and beneficial cooperation between IRRI and its employees."" The existence of this Union factually and tellingly belies the argument that Pres. Decree No. 1620, which grants to IRRI the status, privileges and immunities of an international organization, deprives its employees of the right to self-organization.


The immunity granted being ""from every form of legal process except in so far as in any particular case they have expressly waived their immunity,"" it is inaccurate to state that a certification election is beyond the scope of that immunity for the reason that it is not a suit against ICMC. A certification election cannot be viewed as an independent or isolated process. It could tugger off a series of events in the collective bargaining process together with related incidents and/or concerted activities, which could inevitably involve ICMC in the ""legal process,"" which includes ""any penal, civil and administrative proceedings."" The eventuality of Court litigation is neither remote and from which international organizations are precisely shielded to safeguard them from the disruption of their functions. Clauses on jurisdictional immunity are said to be standard provisions in the constitutions of international Organizations. ""The immunity covers the organization concerned, its property and its assets. It is equally applicable to proceedings 
in personam
 and proceedings
 in rem
."" 
18


We take note of a Manifestation, dated 28 September 1989, in the ICMC Case (p. 161, 
Rollo
), wherein TUPAS calls attention to the case entitled 
""International Catholic Migration Commission v. NLRC, et als
., (G.R. No. 72222, 30 January 1989, 169 SCRA 606), and claims that, having taken cognizance of that dispute (on the issue of payment of salary for the unexpired portion of a six-month probationary employment), the Court is now estopped from passing upon the question of DOLE jurisdiction petition over ICMC.


We find no merit to said submission. Not only did the facts of said controversy occur between 1983-1985, or before the grant to ICMC on 15 July 1988 of the status of a specialized agency with corresponding immunities, but also because ICMC in that case did not invoke its immunity and, therefore, may be deemed to have waived it, assuming that during that period (1983-1985) it was tacitly recognized as enjoying such immunity.


Anent the procedural issue raised in the IRRI Case, suffice it to state that the Decision of the BLR Director, dated 15 February 1989, had not become final because of a Motion for Reconsideration filed by IRRI Said Motion was acted upon only on 30 March 1989 when Rep. Act No. 6715, which provides for direct appeals from the Orders of the Med-Arbiter to the Secretary of Labor in certification election cases either from the order or the results of the election itself, was already in effect, specifically since 21 March 1989. Hence, no grave abuse of discretion may be imputed to respondent Secretary of Labor in his assumption of appellate jurisdiction, contrary to Kapisanan's allegations. The pertinent portion of that law provides:






Art. 259. — Any party to an election may appeal the order or results of the election as determined by the Med-Arbiter 
directly 
to the Secretary of Labor and Employment on the ground that the rules and regulations or parts thereof established by the Secretary of Labor and Employment for the conduct of the election have been violated. Such appeal shall be decided within 15 calendar days (Emphasis supplied).






En passant
, the Court is gratified to note that the heretofore antagonistic positions assumed by two departments of the executive branch of government have been rectified and the resultant embarrassment to the Philippine Government in the eyes of the international community now, hopefully, effaced.


WHEREFORE, in G.R. No. 85750 (the ICMC Case), the Petition is GRANTED, the Order of the Bureau of Labor Relations for certification election is SET ASIDE, and the Temporary Restraining Order earlier issued is made PERMANENT.


In G.R. No. 89331 (the IRRI Case), the Petition is Dismissed, no grave abuse of discretion having been committed by the Secretary of Labor and Employment in dismissing the Petition for Certification Election.


No pronouncement as to costs.
