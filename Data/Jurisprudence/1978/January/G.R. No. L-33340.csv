The record show that on September 30, 1950 Pedro Dandan, married to Paulina de Leon, filed with the Rural Progress Administration, then in charge of the Nuestra Senora de Guia Estate in Tondo, Manila, an application to purchase Lot No. 13, Block 12, Plan Pcs-2555 of the said Estate with an approximate area of 123.6 square meters; that on May 2, 1951 a ""Kasunduan sa Pagbili"" was entered into between the Director of Lands and Pedro Dandan covering said Lot 13, Block 12, Pcs-2555, with an area of 123.6 square meters, which document was approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources on May 5, 1951; that meanwhile on or about April 28, 1951 the occupants of Blocks 11 and 12 of the Estate signed a petition for a resubdivision survey on the ground that the lots as previously subdivided did not conform to the existing improvements thereon; that the petition was approved on September 26, 1951 by the National Planning Commission and a new subdivision survey was executed on March 31, 1952, being Pcs-3526, according to which Lot 13, Block 12, Pcs-2555, containing an area of 123.6 square meters, became Lot 71 with an area of 60 square meters only, a portion of 63.6 square meters having been taken away; that on February 12, 1954 Pedro Dandan sold his rights over the aforesaid Lot 13, Block 12, Pcs-2555, with an area of 123.6 square meters; that the deed of sale was approved by the Undersecretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources on February 18, 1954, that Sales Memorandum of Agreement to Sell No. 14325 over Lot 53, Pcs-3526, with an area of 175.8 square meters with Felipe M. Samson as purchaser and effective on March 29, 1954 was executed; that sometime in April 1954 a dispute arose concerning the portion of 63.6 square meters taken away from Lot No. 13, Block 12, Pcs-2555; that on the one hand, Felipe Samson claimed that the disputed portion of 63.6 square meters belonged to him by virtue of the resubdivision survey based on actual occupancy; that on the other hand, Feliciana Ramos claimed that said portion in dispute was a part and parcel of Lot 13, Block 12, Pcs-2555 which she purchased from Pedro Dandan., the bona fide tenant thereof; that on October 10, 1955 the dispute was decided by the Director of Lands in favor of Feliciana Ramos; that Felipe Samson appealed from said decision; that the Executive Secretary, in a communication dated October 23, 1957 addressed to the counsel of Felipe Samson, dismissed the appeal and the proposed transfer of rights from Pedro Dandan to Feliciana Ramos was given due course; that to stop the implementation of the aforesaid decision, Felipe Samson and his sister, Aurora Samson-Macalino, instituted an action for prohibition and/or injunction docketed as Civil Case No. 42913 in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Executive Secretary, the Chairman, Land Tenure Administration and Feliciana Ramos; that the Court of First Instance dismissed the petition of prohibition and/or injunction; and that the Court of Appeals in CA-G. R. No. 29544-R affirmed the decision of the Court of First Instance in Civil Case No. 42913 dismissing the petition for prohibition and/or injunction.

The issues involved in this appeal are (1) whether the land in question involved in Civil Case No. 42913 of the Court of First Instance of Manila is the same as the land which is the subject matter in the instant case and (2) whether the land sold by the Land Authority on February 3, 1965 to Feliciana Ramos known as Lot 2, Pcs-558U with an area of 123.8 square meters is the same as Lot 13, Block 12, Pcs-2555 awarded to said Feliciana Ramos. 


Lot 2, Pcs-5580 sold to Feliciana Ramos is described as follows:


SUBJECT:


TECHNICAL DESCRIPTIONS:




Lot 2 										Pcs-5580 									(Feliciana Ramos)

Bounded on the SE., along line 1-2, by Lot 1 of the consolidation and subdivision plan; on the SW., along line 2-3, by Lot 54; and along lines 3-4-5, by Lot 55; on the NW., along line 5-6, by LOt 52; on the NE;. along 6-7, by LOt 35; on the NE. and NW., along lines 7-8-9-10, by Road Lot 6; and on the NE., along line 10-1, by lot 34, all of plan PCs-3526.

thence S. 12 De. 58 W., 13.10 m. to point 2; thence N. 79 deg. 3d W., 0.78 m. to point 3; thence N. 73 deg. 12 W., 4.22 m. to point 4; thence N. 77 deg. 39 W., 5.00 to point 5; thence N. 12 deg 21 E., 12.00 m. to point 6; thence S. 77 deg. 39.E., 3.00 m. to point 7; thence S. 77 deg. 39 E., 2.00 m. to point 8; thence S. 77 deg. 39 E., 2.85 m. to point 9; thence N., 14 deg. 15 E., 1.00 m. to point 10; thence S. 72 deg. 37 E., 2.25 m. to the point.

It appears from the foregoing redemption that plan Pcs-5580 is a consolidation and subdivision plan and that Lot 2 thereof is a portion of the consolidation of Lots 53 and 71 of plan PCS- 3526 involved in Civil Case No. 42913 of the Court of First Instance of Manila and CA-G. R. No. 29544, where the Court of Appeals concurred in the following findings of the lower court.




... Precisely, it is to he noted that although Felipe Samson had made a deposit for Lot 53, Pcs-3526, neither Felipe Samson nor the herein petitioners have filed an application to purchase either Lot 53, Pcs-3526 with an area of 175.8 sq. meters, or lot 12, Pcs-2565, with an area of 138.5 sq. meters in the original survey, sold to Feliciana Ramos. Besides, although the name of Felipe Samson appears in the sale memorandum showing down payment and other details of Lot 53, Pcs-3526, with an area of 175.8 sq. meters, the same is not signed, which shows that it has never been approved. And again according to the testimony of Atty. Besa, the prospective awardees of government lots are first being processed in accordance with the provision of Act 539, and Land Administrative Order No. R-3-1, to determine their being landless, and as per above provision, the petitioners have not acquired any rights as yet in Lot-53, Pcs-3526 above-mentioned, specially on this undisputed portion of 63.6 sq. meters, so that they have no material and legal interest in the land question and, therefore, have no basis to bring the instant suit.
10




It is clear that the area of 36.8 square meters sought by the plaintiff-appellant to be deducted from Lot 2, Block 12. Pcs-5580 to be integrated or included in Lot 53-B, Block 12, Plan Pcs-2555 awarded to Feliciana Ramos and that Lot 2, Block 12, Pcs-5580 is the same as Lot 13, Block 12, Pcs-2555. 


The lower court, therefore, correctly dismissed the present action on the ground of 
res judicata
. 


WHEREFORE, the order appealed from dismissing the complaint in Civil Case No. 64400 of the Court of First Instance of Manila is hereby affirmed, with costs against the plaintiff. 


SO ORDERED.
