On September 23, 1968 Antonio E. Prats, doing business under the name of ""Philippine Real Estate Exchange"" instituted against Alfonso Doronila and Philippine National Bank Civil Case No. Q-12412 in the Court of First Instance of Rizal at Quezon City to recover a sum of money and damages.


The complaint stated that defendant Alfonso Doronila was the registered owner of 300 hectares of land situated in Montalban, Rizal, covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 77011, 77013, 216747 and 216750; that defendant Doronila had for sometime tried to sell his aforesaid 300 hectares of land and for that purpose had designated several agents; that at one time, he had offered the same property to the Social Security System but failed to consummate any sale; that his offer to sell to the Social Security System having failed, defendant Doronila on February 14, 1968 gave the plaintiff an exclusive option and authority in writing to negotiate the sale of his aforementioned property, which exclusive option and authority the plaintiff caused to be published in the Manila Times on February 22, 1968; that it was the agreement between plaintiff and defendant Doronila that the basic price shall be P3.00 per square meter, that plaintiff shall be entitled to a commission of 10% based on P2.10 per square meter or at any price finally agreed upon and if the property be sold over and above P3.00 per square meter, the excess shall be created and paid to the plaintiff in addition to his 10% commission based on P2.10 per square meter; that as a result of the grant of the exclusive option and authority to negotiate the sale of his 300 hectares of land situated in Montalban, Rizal in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant Doronila, on February 20, 1968, wrote a letter to the Social Security System withdrawing his previous offer to sell the same land and requesting the return to him of all papers concerning his offered property that the Social Security System, complying with said request of defendant Doronila, returned all the papers thereon and defendant Doronila, in turn gave them to the plaintiff as his duly authorized real estate broker; that by virtue of the exclusive written option and authority granted him and relying upon the announced policy of the President of the Philippines to promote low housing program the plaintiff immediately worked to negotiate the sale of defendant Doronila's 300 hectares of land to the Social Security System, making the necessary contacts and representations to bring the parties together, namely, the owner and the buyer, and bring about the ultimate sale of the land by defendant Doronila to the Social Security System; that on February 27, 1968, after plaintiff had already contacted the Social Security System, its Deputy Administrator, Reynaldo J. Gregorio, wrote a letter to defendant Doronila inviting the latter to a conference regarding the property in question with Administrator Teodoro, Chairman Gaviola and said Reynaldo J. Gregorio on March 4, 1968 at 10:00 o'clock in the morning, stating that the SSS would like to take up the offer of the lot; that having granted plaintiff the exclusive written option and authority to negotiate the sale of his 300 hectares of land, defendant Doronila in a letter dated February 28, 1968 declined the invitation extended by the Social Security System to meet with its Administrator and Chairman and requested them instead ""to deal directly"" with the plaintiff, that on March 16, 1968, at the suggestion of defendant Doronila, the plaintiff wrote a letter to the Social Security System to the effect that plaintiff would be glad to sit with the officials of the Social Security System to discuss the sale of the property of the defendant Doronila; that on March 18, 1968, the Social Security System sent a telegram to defendant Doronila to submit certain documents regarding the property offered; that on May 6, 1968, a written offer to sell the 300 hectares of land belonging to defendant Doronila was formally made by the plaintiff to the Social Security System and accordingly, on May 7, 1968, the Social Security System Administrator dispatched the following telegram to defendant Doronila: ""SSS considering purchase your property for its housing project Administrator Teodoro""; that a few days thereafter, the plaintiff accompanied the defendant Doronila to the China Banking Corporation to arrange the matter of clearing payment by chock and delivery of the titles over the property to the Society Security System; that having been brought together by the plaintiff, the defendant Doronila and the offices of the Society Security System, on May 29, 1968 and on June 4, 1968, met at the office of the SSS Administrator wherein the price for the purchase of the defendant Doronila's 300 hectares of land was, among others, taken up; that on June 20, 1968, the Social Security Commission passed Resolution No. 636 making a counter-offer of P3.25 per square meter subject to an appraise report; that on June 27, 1968, Resolution No. 662 was adopted by the Social Security Commission authorizing the Toples & Harding (Far East) Inc. to conduct an appraisal of the property and to submit a report thereon; that pursuant thereto, the said company submitted its appraisal report specifying that the present value of the property is P3.34 per square meter and that a housing program development would represent the highest and best use thereof, that on July 18, 1968, the Social Security Commission, at its regular meeting, taking note of the favorable appraisal report of the Toples'& Harding (Far East) Inc., passed Resolution No. 738, approving the purchase of defendant Doronila's 300 hectares of land in Montalban, Rizal at a price of P3.25 per square meter or for a total purchase price of Nine Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P9,750,000.00), appropriating the said amount for the purpose and authorizing the SSS Administrator to sign the necessary documents to implement the said resolution; that on July 30, 1968, defendant Doronila and the Social Security System executed the corresponding deed of absolute sale over the 300 hectares of land in Montalban, Rizal covered by Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 77011, 77013, 216747 and 216750 under the terms of which the total price of P9,750,000.00 shall be payable as follows: (a) 60% of the agreed purchase price, or Five Million Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P5,860,000.00) immediately after signing the deed of sale. and (b) the balance of 40% of the agreed price, or Three Million Nine Hundred Thousand Pesos (P3,900,000.00) thirty days after the signing of the deed of absolute sale; that on August 21, 1968, after payment of the purchase price, the deed absolute sale executed by defendant Doronila in favor of the Social Security System was presented for registration in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Rizal, and Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 926574, 226575, 226576 and 226577 in the name of the Social Security System were issued; that defendant Doronila has received the full purchase price for his 300 hectares of land in the total amount of P9,750,000.00, which amount he deposited in his bank Account No. 0012-443 with the defendant Philippine National Bank; that on September 17, 1968, the plaintiff presented his statement to, and demanded of defendant Doronila the payment of his processional fee as real estate broker as computed under the agreement of February 14, 1968 in the total amount of P1,380,000.00; that notwithstanding such demand, the defendant Doronila, in gross and evident bad faith after having availed of the services of plaintiff as real estate broker, refused to pay the professional fees due him; that as a result of defendant Doronila's gross and evident bad faith and unjustified refusal to pay plaintiff the professional fees due him under the agreement, the latter has suffered and continues to suffer mental anguish, serious anxiety, and social humiliation for which defendant Doronila shall be held liable to pay moral damages; and, that by reason likewise of the aforesaid act of defendant Doronila, the plaintiff has been compelled to file this action and to engage the services of counsel at a stipulated professional fee of P250,000.00. 


In his answer filed on November 18, 1968, the defendant Doronila alleged that when the plaintiff offered the answering defendant's property to the Social Security System on May 6, 1968, said defendant had already offered his property to, and had a closed transaction or contract of sale of, said property with the Social Security System; that the letter agreement had become null and void because defendant Doronila had not received any written offer from any prospective buyers of the plaintiff during the agreed period of 60 days until the last day of the authorization which was April 13, 1968 counting from February 14, 1968; that it is not true that plaintiff brought together defendant Doronila and the officials of the Social Security System to take up the purchase price of defendant Doronila's property for the simple reason that the plaintiff's offer was P6.00 per square meter and later on reduced to P4.50 per square meter because the SSS Chairman had already a closed transaction with the defendant Doronila at the price of P3.25 per square meter and that the offer of the plaintiff was refused by the officials of the Social Security System; and that defendant Doronila did not answer the statement of collection of the plaintiff because the latter had not right to demand the payment for services not rendered according to the agreement of the parties. The answering defendant interposed a counterclaim for damages and attorney's fees.


On January 18, 1969, the plaintiff and defendant Alfonso Doronila submitted the following stipulation of facts:

16. 


That on June 6,1968, defendant DORONILA wrote the following letter (Annex"" 7"" for DORONILA), to the plaintiff, to wit: 




I have to inform you officially, that I have not received any written offer from the SSS or others, to purchase my Montalban property of which you were given an option and exclusive authority as appearing in your letter- contract dated February 14, 1968, during the 60 days of your exclusive authority which expired on April 14, 1968, nor during the extension which was properly a new exclusive authority of 30 days from April 18, which expired on May 18, 1968, nor during the provided 15 days grace, in case that you have closed any transaction to terminate it during that period, which also expired on June 3, 1968.


As stated in said letter, we have the following condition: 


5.	If no written offer is made to you until the last day of this authorization, this option and authority shall expire and becomes null and void.


As I have informed you, that on April 16, 1968 or two days after your option expired I have signed an agreement to sell my property to a group of buyers to whom I asked later that the effectivity of said agreement will be after your new authority has expired will be on June 2, 1968, and they have accepted; As your option has expired, and they know that there was no written offer made by the SSS for any price of my property, aside of their previous letter announcing me that they are ready to pay, I was notified on June 4, 1968 by their representative, calling my attention but our agreement; that is why I am writing you, that having expired your option and exclusive authority to offer for sale my said property, I notified only this afternoon said to comply our agreement. 


Hoping for your consideration on the matter, as we have to be guided by contracts that we have to comply, I hereby express to you my sincere sentiments. 




17. 


That on June 19, 1968, defendant DORONILA wrote the following letter (Annex ""5"" of the Answer) to the SSS Administrator, renewing his offer to sell his 300 hectare land to the SSS at P4.00 per square meter, to wit: 




This is to renew my offer to sell my properties located at Montalban, Rizal Identified as Lot Nos. 3-B-7, 26-8, 6, and 4-C-3 registered in my name in the office of the Registry of Deeds of Rizal under T.C.T. Nos. 116631, 77013, 77011 and 216750, containing a total area of 300 hectares or 3,000,000 square meters. 


You will recall that last year, I offered to the Social Security System the same properties at the price of Four (P4.00) pesos per square meter. After 3 ocular inspection of Chairman Gaviola one of said inspections accompanied by Commissioner Arroyo and after receiving the written apprisal report of Manila realtor Vicente L. Narciso, the System then made a counter-offer of Three pesos and twenty-five (P3.25) per square meter which I accepted under the condition that the total amount be paid within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of my acceptance (July 19, 1967). My acceptance was motivated by the fact that within said period of time I had hoped to purchase my sugarcane hacienda in Iloilo with the proceeds I expected from the sale. No action was however taken by the System thereon. 


Recently the same properties were offered by Antonio E. Prats of the Philippine Real Estate Exchange to the Presidential Assistant on Housing, at the price of six pesos (p6.00) per square meter, who referred it to the System, but against no action had been taken by the System. 


Considering the lapse of time since our original offer during which prices of real estate have increased considerably, on the one hand and in cooperation with the System's implementation of our government's policy to provide low cost houses to its members, on the other hand, I am renewing my offer to sell my properties to the system only at the same price of P4.00 per square meter, or for a total amount of twelve million pesos (P12,000,000.00), provided the total amount is paid in cash within a period of fifteen (15) days from this date. 




18.

The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals where the appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. No. 45974-R. 


In a decision promulgated on September 19, 1974, the Court of Appeals reversed the derision of the trial court and dismissed the complaint because: 




In any event, since it has been found that the authority of appellee expired on June 2, 1968, rather than June 12, 1968 as the lower court opined, the inquiry would be whether up to that time, a written offer was made by appellee in behalf of the SSS. The stipulation is clear on this point. There should be a written offer by the prospective buyer or by appellee for or in their behalf, and that if no such written offer is made until the last day of the authorization, the option and authority shall expire and become null and void. Note that the emphasis is placed on the need of a written offer to save the authority from an automatic termination on the last day of the authorization. We note such emphasis with special significance in receive of the condition relative to automatic extension of not more than 15 days if negotiations have been started. The question then is when are negotiations deemed started In the light of the provisions just cited, it should be when a response is given by the prospective buyer showing fits interest to buy the property when an offer is made by the seller or broker and make an offer of the price. Strictly, therefore, prior to May 29, 1968, there were no negotiations yet started within contemplation of the letter-agreement of brokerage (Exh. A). Nevertheless appellant extended appellee's exclusive authority to on May 18, 1968 (par. 10, Stipulation of Facts; R.A. p. 89), which was automatically extended by 15 days under their agreement, to expire on June 2, 1968, if the period extended up to May 18, 1968 a necessary authority. For, it may even be considered as taking the of the 15-days automatic extension, since appellee's pretension is that negotiations have been started within the original period of 60 days. Appellant in fixing the expiry date on June 2, 1968, has thus made a liberal concession in favor of appellee, when he chose not to the extension up to May 18, 1968 as the automatic extension which ougth to have been no more than 15 days, but which he stretched twice as long.

IV


THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AWARDING ATTORNEY'S FEES TO PRIVATE RESPONDENT DORONILA INSTEAD OF AFFIRMING THE AWARD OF MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AS WELL As ATTORNEY FEES TO PETITIONER.

The Court in its Resolution of May 23, 1975 originally denied the petition for lack of merit but upon petitioner's motion for reconsideration and supplemental petition invoking equity, resolved in its Resolution of August 20, 1975 to give due course thereto. 


From the stipulation of facts and the evidence of record, it is clear that the offer of defendant Doronila to sell the 300 hectares of land in question to the Social Security System was formally accepted by the System only on June 20, 1968 after the exclusive authority, Exhibit A, in favor of the plaintiff, petitioner herein, had expired. The respondent court's factual findings that petitioner was not the efficient procuring cause in bringing about the sale proceeding from the fact of expiration of his exclusive authority) which are admittedly final for purposes of the present petition, provide no basis law to grant relief to petitioner. The following pertinent excerpts from respondent court's extensive decision amply demonstrate this: 








It is noted, however, that even in his brief, when he said — 


According to the testimony of the plaintiff-appellee a few days before May 29, 1968, he arranged with Mr. Gilberto Teodoro, SSS Administrator, a meeting with the defendant Manila. He talked with Mr. Teodoro over the telephone and fixed the date of the meeting with defendant-appellant Doronila for May 29, 1968, and that he was specifically requested by Mr. Teodoro not to be present at the meeting, as he, Teodoro, wanted to deal directly with the defendant-appellant alone. (Tsn., pp. 4446, March 1, 1969). Finding nothing wrong with such a request, as the sale could be caused directly or indirectly (Exh. 'A'), and believing that as a broker all that he needed to do to be entitled to his commission was to bring about a meeting between the buyer and the seller as to ripen into a sale, plaintiff-appellee readily acceded to the request. 




appellee is not categorical that it was through his efforts that the meeting took place on inlay 29, 1968. He refers to a telephone call he made ""a few days before May 29, 1968,"" but in the conversation he had with Mr. Teodoro, the latter requested him not to be present in the meeting. From these facts, it is manifest that the SSS officials never wanted to be in any way guided by, or otherwise subject to, the mediation or intervention of, appellee relative to the negotiation for the purchase of the property. It is thus more reasonable to conclude that if a meeting was held on May 29, 1968, it was done independently, and not by virtue of, appellee's wish or efforts to hold such meeting.

... It is even doubtful if he tried to make any arrangement for meeting at all, because on May 18, 1968, he told appellant: 




... we hereby make a firm offer, for and in behalf of our buyer, to purchase said property at the price of Four Pesos and Fifty Centavos (P4.50) per square meter .... 




As this offer is evidently made in behalf of buyer other than the SSS which had never offered the price of P4.50 per square meter, appellee could not have at the same time arranged a meeting between the SSS officials and appellant with a view to consummating the sale in favor of the SSS which had made an offer of only PS.25 per sq. m. and thus lose the much bigger profit he would realize with a higher price of P4.50 per sq. meter. This 'firm offer' of P4.50 per sq. m. made by appellee betrayed his lack of any efficient intervention in the negotiations with the SSS for the purchase by it of appellant's property ...

xxx			xxx			xxx


... This becomes more evident when it is considered that on May 6, 1968 he was making his first offer to sell the property at P6.00 per sq. m. to the SSS to which offer he received no answer. It is this cold indifference of the SSS to him that must have prompted him to look for other buyers, resulting in his making the firm offer of 714.50 per sq. m. on May 18, 1968, a fact which only goes to show that for being ignored by the SSS, he gave up all effort to deal with the SSS. ...

xxx			xxx			xxx


... For him to claim that it was he who aroused the interest of the SSS in buying appellant's property is to ignore the fact that as early as June, (July) 1967, the SSS had directly dealt with appellant to such an extent that the price of P3.25 as offered by the SSS was accepted by appellant, the latter imposing only the condition that the price should be paid in cash, and within 30 days from the date of the acceptance. It can truly be said then that the interest of SSS to acquire the property had been sufficiently aroused for there to be any need for appellee to stimulate it further. Appellee should know this fact for according to him, the 10-day grace period was agreed upon to give the SSS a chance to pay the price of the land at P3.25 per sq. m., as a ""compromise"" to appellant's insistence that the SSS be excluded from appellee's option or authority to sell the land.

... There should be a written offer by the prospective buyer or by appellee for or in their behalf, and that if no such written offer is made until the last day of the authorization, the option and authority shall expired and become null and void. ... Yet, no such written offer was made. ...

In 
equity
, however, the Court notes that petitioner had Monthly taken steps to bring back together respondent Doronila and the SSS, among which may be mentioned the following: 


In July, 1967, prior to February 14, 1968, respondent Doronila had offered to sell the land in question to the Social Security System Direct negotiations were made by Doronila with the SSS. The SSS did not then accept the offer of Doronila. Thereafter, Doronila executed the exclusive authority in favor of petitioner Prats on February 14, 1968. 


Prats communicated with the Office of the Presidential Housing Commission on February 23, 1968 offering the Doronila property. Prats wrote a follow-up letter on April is, 1968 which was answered by the Commission with the suggestion that the property be offered directly to the SSS. Prats wrote the SSS on March 16, 1968, inviting Chairman Ramon Gaviola, Jr. to discuss the offer of the sale of the property in question to the SSS. On May 6, 1968, Prats made a formal written offer to the Social Security System to self the 300 hectare land of Doronila at the price of P6.00 per square meter. Doronila received on May 17, 1968 from the SSS Administrator a telegram that the SSS was considering the purchase of Doronilas property for its housing project. Prats and his witness Raagas testified that Prats had several dinner and lunch meetings with Doronila and/or his nephew, Atty. Manuel D. Asencio, regarding the progress of the negotiations with the SSS. 


Atty. Asencio had declared that he and his uncle, Alfonso Doronila, were invited several times by Prats, sometimes to luncheons and sometimes to dinner. On a Sunday, June 2, 1968, Prats and Raagas had luncheon in Sulu Hotel in Quezon City and they were joined later by Chairman Gaviola of the SSS. 


The Court has noted on the other hand that Doronila finally sold the property to the Social Security System at P3.25 per square meter which was the very same price counter-offered by the Social Security System and accepted by him in July, 1967 when he alone was dealing exclusively with the said buyer long before Prats came into the picture but that on the other hand Prats' efforts somehow were instrumental in bringing them together again and finally consummating the transaction at the same price of P3.25 square meter, although such finalization was after the expiration of Prats' extended exclusive authority. Still such price was higher than that stipulated in the exclusive authority granted by Doronila to Prats. 


Under the circumstances, the Court grants in equity the sum of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) by way of compensation for his efforts and assistance in the transaction, which however was finalized and consummated after the expiration of his exclusive authority and sets aside the P10,000.00 — attorneys' fees award adjudged against him by respondent court. 


WHEREFORE, the derision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with the modification that private respondent Alfonso Doronila in equity is ordered to pay petitioner or his heirs the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) and that the portion of the said decision sell petitioner Prats to pay respondent Doronila attorneys' fees in the sum of P10,000.00 is set aside. 


The lifting of the injunction issued by the lower court on the P2,000,000.00 cash deposit of respondent Doronila as ordered by respondent court is hereby with the exception of the sum of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) which is ordered segregated therefrom to satisfy the award herein given to petitioner, the lifting of said injunction, as herein ordered, is immediately executory upon promulgation hereof.


No pronouncement as to costs.
