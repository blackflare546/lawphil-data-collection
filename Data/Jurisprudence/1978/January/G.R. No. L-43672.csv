SECOND DIVISION


G.R. No. L-43672	January 31, 1978


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,

vs.


HON. G. JESUS B. RUIZ, Presiding Judge, Branch I, Court of First Instance, First Judicial District, Tuguegarao, Cagayan and RODRIGO MAMANAO y BATTUNG, 
respondents.
 


Teodoro L. Hernando, Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Cagayan for petitioner. 




FERNANDO, 
J.:


To state the question raised in this mandamus proceeding is to render evident why the Comment of Solicitor General Mendoza 
1
 was quite emphatic as to its being devoid of support in law. The prosecution in a criminal case for homicide, apparently dissatisfied with the decision of respondent Judge Jesus B. Ruiz of the Court of First Instance of the First Judicial District stationed in Tuguegarao, Cagayan convicting private respondent Rodrigo Mamanao of homicide but finding him entitled to the benefits of incomplete self-defense, there being unlawful aggression from the victim and no provocation on his part, filed a notice of appeal. More specifically, the objection was to the penalty imposed of six months and one day and the indemnity to the heirs of the deceased fixed at P4,000.00. Respondent Judge having failed to honor such notice of appeal, he was sought to be compelled by this petition to comply with what the prosecution considered ""a purely ministerial act."" 
2
 As was pointed out in the aforesaid Comment, 
People v. Ang Cho Kio 
3


 is squarely in point. In that 1954 decision, this Tribunal, through Justice Pablo, squarely ruled: ""Creemos que en el caso presente se pone al acusado en double 
jeopardy
, esto es en el peligro de recibir la condena de reclusion perpetua despues de haber sido condenado ya por el juzgado inferior a una pena menor Por este peligro, el ministerio fiscal no puede apelar de acuerdo con el articulo 2 de la Regia 118 y siguendo la guarantia constitutional de que 'no se pondra a una persona el peligro de serve castigada dos veces por la misma infraccion' en 
jeopardy
.""

The petition must fail. 


1.	It is indeed surprising that Assistant Fiscal Teodoro L. Hernando, who prepared and signed to petition, 
5
 could so confidently assert that he could rely on Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Court. He completely ignored Section 2 which reads thus: ""The People of the Philippines can not appeal if the defendant would be placed thereby in double jeopardy. In all other cases either party may appeal from a final judgment or ruling or from an order made after judgment affecting the substantial rights of the appeallant."" 
6
 He likewise ignored the explicit ruling in Ang Cho Kio. In 
People v. Pae
, 
7
 decided two years later, Justice Montemayor, speaking for the Court reaffirmed such a doctrine: ""With the view we take of the propriety and legality of the appeal, we find it unnecessary to go into the merits of the contention of the parties, although it may not be out of place to state that acording to the decision of June 10, 1955, as well as the appealed resolution, the penalty imposed which did not include the confiscation of the amount of $3,140, was upon the recommendation of the prosectuion itself. In the first place, the confiscation or forteiture of the above mentioned sum would be an additional penalty and would amount to an increase of the penalty already imposed upon the accused. To reopen the case for the purspose of increasing the penalty as is sought in the Government's appeal, would be placing the accused in double jeopardy, and under Rule 118, section 2 of the Rules of Court, the Government's can not appeal in a criminal case if the defendant would be placed thereby in double jeopardy.

2.	There ought ot have been awareness on the part of Assistnat Provincial Fiscal Hernando that on at least two occasions the Ang Cho Kio ruling was sought to be reocnsidered, but in each time it failed. In 
People v. Pomeroy
, 
9
 the then Justice, later Chief Justice, Concepcion, explained why: ""The prosecution in the case at bar urges a reexamination of the question decided in the Ang Cho Kio cases and a reconsideration of the view therein expressed by this Court. To our mind, however, the reasons advanced by the Solicitor General in support of his pretense are not sufficiently weighty to warrant a reversal of said view which is a mere corollary of the practice established in the Philippines and in the United States, for so long a time as to form part and parcel not merely of the settled jurisprudence, but, also, of the constitutional law, in both jurisdictions."" 
10
 In 
People v. Arinso
, 
11
 it was the same fate that attended such a move. 


3. 	The tone of confidence quite marked in the petition was most certainly unwarranted. Assistant Provincial Fiscal Hernando and Provincial Fiscal Bello would have been well-advised had they exerted greater efforts to acquaint themselves with the state of the law. They must ever keep in mind that decisions of this Court are authoritative land therefore call for deference and respect. Moreover, as appealed criminal cases, when allowable under existing legal are handled by the Office of the Solicitor-Generality would have been dictated by prudence, to say the least, if that dignitary were consulted. Then blunders of this kind would have been avoided. The prosecutors, responsible for this petition would have been spared the mild reproof implicit in the comment of Solicitor-General Mendoza, arising from their inadequate grasp of controlling doctrine especially those of constitutional dimension.
