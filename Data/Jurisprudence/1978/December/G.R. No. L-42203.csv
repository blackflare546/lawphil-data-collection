FERNANDEZ, 
J.:


This is a petition to review the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in R04-WC Case No. 153261 entitled ""
Aurora F. Dizon vs. Republic of the Philippines (Department of Foreign Affairs)
 
1
 which affirmed the decision of the Referee of the Regional Office No. 4, Department of Labor, Manila, dismissing the complaint for lack of merit.

On May 24, 1974, Aurora F. Dizon, a foreign service officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Manila, filed a notice of injury or sickness and claim for compensation at the Regional Office No. 4, Department of Labor, Manila, claiming compensation as a result of psychiatric illness allegedly caused by the nature of her employment in 1964 and directly aggravated by said employment. The claim was docketed as Case No. R04-WC Case No. 153261. 


In a decision dated May 9, 1975, the Labor Referee dismissed the case for lack of merit on the ground that the claimant, Aurora F. Dizon, was not entitled to compensation in as much as the claimant's illness was not due to the nature of her employment nor aggravated thereby. 


The claimant appealed to the Workmen's Compensation Commission. On November 29, 1975, the Commission affirmed the decision of the Referee. Hence, this petition for review. 


The record shows that Aurora F. Dizon started working with the Department of Foreign Affairs on April 1, 1959 as foreign service officer with a daily wage of P10.33 working five (5) days a week. Sometime in 1964 while she was assigned to work in the European Division of the Philippine Mission at Geneva, Switzerland, she developed symptoms of an illness manifested by nervousness, irritability and suspiciousness. The illness was allegedly induced by the maltreatment of the claimant by her employer. When the symptoms became persistent, Aurora F. Dizon was recalled to the Philippines and she submitted for medical treatment to Dr. Baltazar V. Reyes on February 10, 1965. Dr. Reyes found her to be sick of anxiety reaction with depressive features. Since then she went on sick leaves on and off up to 1966 when she worked regularly up to the present. While under treatment, she incurred medical expenses for which receipts were submitted and evaluation by Dr. Valenti Poji Compensation Rating Medical Officer of Regional Office No. 4. The claim was rejected because Dr. Baltazar V. Reyes stated in his report that the illness of Aurora F. Dizon was psychiatric and the same could not be the result of the nature of her employment nor was it aggravated by such employment.

It is true that under Sec. 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, it is presumed that the employees illness which supervened during his employment either arose out of or at least was aggravated by said employment.

However. the very evidence of the petitioner consisting of her physician's report of sickness or accident'

shows that her illness was neither due to nor aggravated by her employment. Said physician's report also stated that the claimant can continue working. It is a fact then that the petitioner was not disabled by her illness. She continued in her employment with the Department of Foreign Affairs. The leaves of absence of the petitioner are: 




Exh. ""G"" — Four days vacation leave-April 4-6, 1966
