The defendant, Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc., appealed to the Court of Appeals where the case was docketed as CA-G.R. No. 30995-R.


The appellant assigns the following errors:




I


THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE TENDER OF PAYMENT MADE BY THE APPELLANT THROUGH ITS LETTER EXH. ""3-ASSOCIATED"" ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1956, NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH RESOLUTION NO. 39 OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF PLAINTIFF- APPELLEE.


II


THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE GENERAL MANAGER OF PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO REFUSE PAYMENT TENDERED BY THE APPELLANT. 


III


THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN RENDERING JUDGMENT AGAINST THE APPELLANT.

In a resolution promulgated on May 26, 1967, the Court of Appeals elevated the case to the Supreme Court ""Considering that the findings of fact made by the lower court are not controverted by the defendant and considering further that the lone issue raised by defendant in its brief is one that calls for a legal interpretation of the terms and conditions of Resolution No. 39 which was unanimously passed by the Board of Directors of plaintiff on February 9, 1956, i.e., whether or not the general manager of plaintiff was justified in refusing to accept the tender of payment made by defendant on September 7, 1956 ...

The evidence of defendant Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. consists of its letter, dated September 7, 1956 (Exhibit ""3-Asso.""), sending therewith S.B.T.C. Check No. 513348-B (Exhibit ""3-Asso.""), for P200.00, to cover the August installment on the account of defendant Arsenio Olmos; cash voucher for P200.00 in payment of installment due on account for account month of August, 1956 (Exhibit ""3-Asso.""); Check No. 513485-B, dated October 1, 1956, for P200.00, payable to plaintiff corporation (Exhibit ""4-Asso,""); cash voucher for P200.00 in payment of installment due for account month of September, 1956 (Exhibit ""4-Asso.""); Check No. 513514- B, dated October 5, 1956 for P200.00 in favor of plaintiff corporation (Exhibit ""5-Asso.""); cash voucher for P200.00 for partial. refund of deposit payable — payment of October, 1956, installment (Exhibit ""5-Asso.""); Check No. 536878, dated November 6, 1956, for P200.00 n favor of plaintiff corporation (Exhibit ""6-Asso,""): cash voucher for P200.00 in partial refund of deposit payable payment of November installment (Exhibit ""6- Asso.""); and account letter of account General Manager of plaintiff corporation to defendant Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc., dated December 5, 1956 (Exhibit ""7-Asso.""), stating therein that account remittance of P600.00, which was being returned, would be accept by plaintiff if account P10,000.00 be remitted or paid to it as required in account resolution of account Board of Directors of October 5, 1956.

This appeal has no merit. 


The tender of payment by the defendant-appellant, Associated Insurance and Surety Co., Inc., of account installments paid when due is not a valid defense. under Resolution No. 39 of account Board of Directors of account plaintiff-appellee, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, once the defendant Arsenio Olmos has defaulted in account payment of a single installment account balance of account whole amount due and still unpaid may be recovered from account appellant sureties. Said Resolution No. 39 specifically provides that should defendant Arsenio Olmos fail to pay any of account installments on account dates they respectively fell due, account plaintiff-appellee shall have account right to take immediate and necessary steps for account collection from account sureties of Arsenio Olmos account balance of account whole amount due and still unpaid. It was not necessary that account appellant, Associated Insurance and Surety Co., Inc., be notified of account default of account defendant Arsenio Olmos in account payment of account installments. 


The refusal of account General Manager of account plaintiff-appellee to accept- account payment of P200.00 to cover account installment of August 1956 of account accounts of Arsenio Olmos did not need account authority of account Board of Directors. Said General Manager was merely enforcing Resolution No. 39. 


The lower court did not err in rendering judgment against the appellant. 


WHEREFORE, account decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against account defendant-appellant, Associated insurance and Surety Co., Inc.


SO ORDERED.
