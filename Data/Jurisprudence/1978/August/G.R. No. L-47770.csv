After reviewing the allegations, issues raised and the arguments adduced in the instant petition for review on certiorari of the decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals (which initially led this Court on March 17, 1978 to give due course to the petition and to issue a temporary restraining order enjoining the respondents and the Sheriff of Zamboanga City from further proceeding with the enforcement of the writ and/or alias writ of execution of garnishment and of demolition dated August 18, 1977 and September 9, 1977 issued in the case below, Civil Case No. 1944 of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City, Branch 1, which the Court afterwards lifted on July 17, 1978 upon respondent's motion) and finding in the light of the pleadings and the record that no substantial grounds exist for attributing ""grave and reversible errors of law"" to respondent Court of Appeals in sustaining the writ of execution issued by respondent judge for petitioners' failure to file a sufficient supersedeas bond and the judgment below at any rate having now become final and executory rendering moot the issue at bar. (See Sollorano vs. Court of Appeals, 62 SCRA 478; Res. of August 3, 1977 in L-45053, De Ocampo vs. Court of Appeals); 


The Court accordingly Resolved to grant respondent's Motion to Dismiss and to DISMISS the case at bar.
