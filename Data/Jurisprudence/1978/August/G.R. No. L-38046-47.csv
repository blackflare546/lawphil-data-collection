CONCEPCION JR., 
J.:


Petitioner for 
certiorari
 and prohibition with preliminary injunction to annul and set aside the resolution of the respondent Court of Appeals in cases CA-G. R. Nos. 42549-50-R, denying the petitioners' motion to dismiss the appeal of the private respondents, as well as the resolution denying the motion for its reconsideration; and to restrain the respondent appellate court from further proceeding with the appeal of the private respondents. 


On April 26, 1963, Adriano Afro and Teodorico Davi filed an application for the registration of 2 parcels of land, Lots Nos. 1 and 2, Psu-154387, LRC Case No. N-1897; LRC Rec. No. N24187, situated in the sitio of Pinagbarilan, barrio Sto. Cristo, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. The application was opposed by Nicetas Davi Gloria Davi Flordeliza Elfa Ricardo Elfa and Eduardo Elfa who had also filed an application for the registration of the same parcels of land, designated as Lot Nos. I and 2, Psu-149407, LRC Case No. N-1920, LRC Rec. No. 24192, on June 7, 1963. 


The cases were heard jointly, and on January 26, 1972, the Court of First Instance of Bulacan rendered judgment ordering the dismissal of the application filed by Nicetas Davi Gloria Davi Flordeliza Elfa Ricardo Elfa and Eduardo Elfa and the registration of the disputed parcel of land in the names of Adriano Afro and Teodorico Davi 


By reason thereof, Nicetas Davi Gloria Davi Flordeliza Elfa Ricardo Elfa and Eduardo Elfa appealed to the Court of Appeals, where their appeal was docketed as case CA-G.R. Nos. 42549-R. 


On July 30, 1973, Adriano Afro and Teodorico Davi appellees therein, filed with the Court of Appeals, a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the record on appeal fails to show upon its face that the appeal was perfected on time, in that the motion for extension of time to file record on appeal was filed one day after the expiration of the period sought to be extended; and that there is nothing in the record on appeal to show that appellants' motion for extension of time to file record on appeal was granted by the court below, which motion was denied on December 7, 1973. The appellees then filed a motion for the reconsideration of the said resolution, but the said motion was also denied. Whereupon, the appellees Adriano Afro and Teodorico Davi filed the instant petition for certiorari and prohibition with Preliminary injunction. As prayed for, a temporary restraining order was issued by the Court on January 17, 1974. 


After the parties had filed the necessary pleadings, the Court deemed the case submitted for decision. 


On July 5, 1978, the parties submitted, for the approval of the Court, a compromise agreement which reads, as follows:
