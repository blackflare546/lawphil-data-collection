A writ of preliminary injunction was issued by this Court on May 29, 1969 to restrain the enforcement of that order. The was amended on January 9, 1970 for the purpose of directing the Commission to suspect the consideration of i respondent Nayve's application. 


Nayve answered the petition and later filed a memorandum in lieu of oral argument. 'The case was submitted for decision on May 5, 1969. 


In this Court's resolution of January 30, 1978, the parties were directed to inform this Court whether the case had become moot and academic in the Height of supervening events.
