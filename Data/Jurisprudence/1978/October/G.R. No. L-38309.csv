vs.


ANGELITO DE JESUS, 
defendant-appellant. 


Fausto S. Arce for appellant. 


Solicitor General Estelito P. Mendoza, Assistant Solicitor General Octavio R Ramirez and Solicitor N. P. de Pano, Jr. for appellee. 




AQUINO, 
J.:


Angelita de Jesus appealed from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan, convicting him of rape, sentencing him to life imprisonment and ordering him to indemnify Lualhati Landayan in the sum of P165 (Criminal Case No. 0560-M).


The spouses, Feliciana Nuguid and Rogelio Landayan, residents of Barrio Santol Balagtas (Bigaa), Bulacan, have a daughter named Lualhati who was born on January 22, 1963 (she was in the fourth grade in 1972). In the evening of Sunday, May 21, 1972, on the occasion of a Flores de Mayo procession, Feliciana gave Lualhati permission to follow the procession in the company of their neighbor, Josie Garcia, a twenty-five-year old woman. Josie and Lualhati watched the procession which ended at around midnight in the barrio chapel. They did not go home immediately because Josie stayed in the chapel and recited the prayers of the rosary. As Lualhati was sleepy and tired, Josie told her to sleep on the bench inside the chapel and informed her that she would go to the basketball court behind the chapel and wake her up after the championship game was over. Josie left the nine-year old girl sleeping on the front bench in the chapel and watched the basketball game. The game was concluded at around two-thirty in the 


As testified by Lualhati and as recounted in appellant's brief, shortly after midnight, or in the early morning of May 22, 1972, she experienced the sensation of being bodily lifted and carried by someone because her head was swaying. She demonstrated to the court how her head swayed. When she woke up, she found herself lying on a haystack or ""mandala ng giniikan"" which was near the ricefields or about fifty meters away from the chapel and which was also near the compound of the Rice and Corn Administration (RCA) in that locality. 


She noticed that a man was on top of her. She instinctively pushed him back and, in doing so, she touched his mustache and perceived his facial features. The haystack received illumination from four electric bulbs a few meters away, from the lamps attached to two electric posts nearby, and from the revolving searchlight of the RCA compound. (See sketch, Exh. D). 


After having been pushed back, the man boxed Lualhati on the face and she became unconscious. She regained consciousness when the man was withdrawing his organ from her vagina and she felt the pain caused by the sexual assault. He sat on her legs. Then, she asked his permission to go back to the chapel. He allowed her to leave the haystack but he warned her that he would kill her and her parents in case she would reveal that he had ravished her. Lualhati returned, to the chapel and looked for her Nanang Josie. She could not find Josie. Lualhati went home in the company of other children named Boy Oding, ,Merle Elsa and Ines. Josie had gone home after the basketball game when she did not find Lualhati in the chapel. 


At seven o'clock in the morning, while Lualhati was asleep, her mother noticed that her left cheek was swollen. She woke up her daughter and inquired what had happened to her. Lualhati did not answer and just gave her mother a blank stare. The mother brought her to the chapel and verified whether there was a haystack near the chapel. Lualhati had told her that it was in that place where she woke up. 


Then, Feliciana brought her daughter to the clinic of Doctor Mario Puatu. He found that Lualhati (1) had fresh bleeding lacerations in her hymen at the ""three o'clock and nine o'clock"" positions, (2) ecchymosis on the left cheek and (3) an abrasion in the corner or canthus of her left eye. 


After Feliciana had been assured by Doctor Puatu that her daughter had been raped, she and Lualhati went to the residence of Feliciana's grandmother which was near the chapel. There, she made inquiries as to whether after midnight some persons had seen a child being carried and brought to the haystack. Later, she took Lualhati to the clinic of the municipal health officer, Doctor Roberta S. Regalado.


That official examined Lualhati and found that a slight opening of her introitus or vaginal orifice caused bloody oozing from a laceration of the hymen at the six o'clock position. A strand of hair and bits of hay were found in the labia majora. Lualhati's thighs and legs had violaceous discolorations and she had abrasions and hematoma on the left cheek and hematomas in the left comer of her lip and on the left zygomatic region. 


Doctor Regalado was unable to make an internal examination because Lualhati was uncooperative and could not endure the pain. So, Feliciana Landayan brought her daughter to Doctor Nieto M. Salvador, a medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), who at ten o'clock in the evening of that same day, May 22,1972, examined the victim. His findings are contained in a report signed by him and by Doctor Ernesto G. Brion, the NBI assistant director, and by Lorenzo Sunico, the NBI deputy director for technical services (Exh G). 


In that report, Doctor Salvador found a gaping labia majora, a coaptated labia minora, a fresh bleeding laceration in Lualhati's fourchette extending to the posterior commissure and base of the hymen at the six o'clock position. He also found a contused vestibular mucosa and a narrow, thin hymen with fresh bleeding lacerations ""compound at 3 o'clock and deep at 9 o'clock positions"" with contused hymenal edges. The hymenal orifice admitted a tube five millimeters in diameter with moderate resistance. No bigger tube could be inserted due to extreme pain. The vaginal walls were moderately tight with prominent rugosities.


Doctor Salvador concluded that Lualhati ""could have had sexual intercourse"" with a man on or about the alleged date of the commission of the rape and that the injuries on her left creek and comer of her left eye could have been inflicted at the same time. The doctor recovered bits of hay from the labia majora (Exh. F). As advised by the doctor, Lualhati was confined at the provincial hospital on May 23 to control the bleeding in her vagina. She stayed in the charity ward for five days. Her mother spent P165 for medicines and incidental expenses. 


At four o'clock in the afternoon of May 22, 1972, Feliciana Landayan reported to the police that Lualhati had been raped. Feliciana's statement was taken by Lieutenant Leonardo B. Feliciano, the investigator of the Balagtas Police Department and a resident of Barrio Borol, 1st Balagtas. The next day, Lieutenant Feliciano went to Barrio Santol to investigate the incident. He made an ocular inspection of the scene of the crime and made inquiries. Florante Dizon, a nine-year old boy, told him that he saw a man wearing red pants who was inside the chapel in the evening of May 21, 1972. Feliciano learned that the man wearing red pants was Angelito de Jesus (pp. 1718, Record). 


Lieutenant Feliciano picked up De Jesus and brought him to the notice of the chief of police. De Jesus refused to give a statement. Feliciano also picked up two other suspects, Raymundo (Reynaldo) Castro and Teodoro Libiran, who were seen in the vicinity of the chapel on the night of the rape and who were both mustachioed (page 17 of the Record). The three suspects were detained. Other suspects, who were investigated and later released, were Diosdado Estrella and Pablo Lopez (Exh, 6). 


On May 25, 1972, leutenant Feliciano took the statement of Florante Dizon who declared that he saw a man in white, short- sleeved polo shirt and dark pants, using yellow Japanese sandals, sleeping on the second bench in the chapel in the evening of May 22, 1972 after the procession had entered the chapel. De Jesus was brought before Florante Dizon for Identification. Florante, who was told by his brother that the man's name was Lito de Jesus, Identified him as the man whom he saw sleeping inside the chapel. (See pp. 9- 10, Record). 


On May 30, 1972, or after the discharge of Lualhati from tile hospital, Lieutenant Feliciano arranged a confrontation in the municipal building between her and the three suspects. 'They were separately brought to Lualhati two times by Feliciano. She declared that Castro and Libiran were not the persons who had raped her. When she saw De Jesus, she Identified him twice as the rapist.


The Identification of De Jesus as the rapist was made while Lieutenant Feliciano was taking Lualhati's statement in tile office of the chief of police in tile presence of Corporal Wilfredo M. Cortan. On the basis of the sworn statements of Lualhati, her mother and Florante Dizon and the medical certificates issued by Doctors Puatu and Regalado and the living case report submitted by Doctor Salvador (Exh. G), Feliciana N. Landayan filed against De Jesus in the municipal court a complaint for rape dated May 30, 1972.


During the preliminary examination the municipal judge took down the sworn declarations of Lualhati, her mother, leutenant Feliciano, Josie Garcia and Santos Manabat. Lualhati repeated what she stated in tier sworn statement that, the man who was on top of her at the haystack had a mustache and wore red pants. Lieutenant Feliciano declared before tile municipal judge that De Jesus admitted that he was wearing red pants in the evening of May 21, 1972. In fact, Lieutenant Feliciano got from him his red pants and they were shown to Lualhati. She Identified the same as tile red pants which De Jesus was wearing at the haystack (pp 17-18 of tile Record), Santos Manabat declared that he saw De Jesus near the Chapel after the basketball game had ended .


The municipal judge, having found reasonable ground to believe that De Jesus had raped Lualhati, issued on June 8, 1972 a warrant of his arrest. He posted bail and was released on July 9, 1972. This would explain why De Jesus, according to his confession (Exh, H), was able to 
commit another rape on June 4, 1972
. He was still at liberty on that date.


De Jesus waived the second stage of the preliminary investigation. The case was elevated to the Court of First t Instance where on August 9, 1972 the provincial fiscal tiled against him an information for rape. After trial, the court rendered the judgment on conviction already mentioned.


De Jesus, a twenty-eight year old carpenter, married with three children, all girls, was a resident of Barrio Santol. He finished the fourth grade. His residence was adjacent to the chapel. ""After the wall of the chapel, then my house, About one arm's length from the wall of the chapel"", De Jesus testified (25 tsn February 22, 1973).


He declared that from eight o'clock in the evening of May 21, 1972 to three o'clock the following morning, he was in the basketball court behind the chapel On that occasion, which was the last day of the
 Flores de Mayo
 celebration, there was a procession, which was followed by a band concert and a basketball championship game which was finished at three o'clock in the morning. De Jesus said that he left the basketball court only once and that was at eight-thirty when he took supper. He returned to the place at nine o'clock. He was the captain of the white team, one of the five teams that participated in the contest but which did not play that evening. At three o'clock, he went home and slept.


He said that he was detained as a suspect in the evening of May 23,1972 and he was investigated by Fiscal Vidal M. Tombo a state prosecutor of the Department of Justice, rewarding at Balagtas and functioning as the adviser of its police department. De Jesus said that he met Fiscal Tombo during election time when he went to De Jesus' house to convince him to join Tombo's party.


De Jesus testified that after the investigation, he was brought to the second floor of the municipal hail where Sergeant Rogelio Carvana and other policemen removed his pubic hair. Then. he was taken downstairs where two young girls were asked to Identify him. They said that he was not the rapist. Sergeant Caravans denied this testimony of De Jesus.


De Jesus declared that, for fear of investment, he signed a waiver of his right under article 125 of the Revised Penal Code not to arbitrarily detained. From May 23 to 30, 1972 he was investigated daily by Fiscal Tombo and by Vice-Mayor Simplicio Landayan, the acting mayor, who happens to be Lualhati's grandfather.


De Jesus said that on May 30, 1972, he was brought from the jail to the mayor's office, where he saw Fiscal Tombo, Vice-Mayor Landayan and Lualhati. The vice-mayor covered the mouth of De Jesus and then asked Lualhati if De Jesus was a culprit and she said that he was not the one. De Jesus said that he was brought back and forth from the jail to the mayor's office five times and at the fifth nine Lualhati identified him as the rapist. When he composed that for four times Lualhati did not point to him as the culprit, Fiscal Tombo pushed him and ordered that he be returned to jail. He said that he signed a six-page statement before Fiscal Tombo. 


De Jesus testified that he was released only on May 31, or after the expiration of the seven-day period fixed in section 15, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court and only after his lawyer threatened to file a petition for habeas corpus but it was made to appear in the police blotter that he was released in the afternoon of May 30 or within the seven-day period. He said that, when he was leaving the detention cell Fiscal Tombo approached him and warned him: ""Lito, hindi ka makakalayo ipakukulong kitang muli "" 


He d that after he had posted bait he saw Fiscal Tombo who told hint ""Do you believe me now, Lito? Talagang matigas ka, Lito, nakapiyansa ka pa. Hayaan mo, titingnan ko ang tigas mo at isasaksak kita sa isang asuntong walang piyansa.""


On July 1, 1972, he was again arrested in connection with the case for rape and homicide involving Aurora Santos. At the municipal hall he saw Fiscal Tombo with some NBI agents who took him to Manila for investigation.


When De Jesus was asked by his counsel as to the truth of Lualhati's charge that he had sexually abused her, he replied that he could not have done such a thing because he has three daughters, who are young like Lualhati, and because he is a married man living peacefully in Barrio Santol De Jesus admitted that there was a haystack about sixty meters away from the RCA compound and that the vicinity was well-lighted. A defense witness testified that the RCA compound was about fifty meters away from the chapel (17 tsn February 16; 1973).


Narciso Diamzon, a pharmacist, a resident of Barrio Santol the c of the basketball league, and a friend of De Jesus, testified that he saw De Jesus in the basketball court in the evening of May 21, 1972 and in the following up to three o'clock. He had asked De Jesus and the other team captains to guard the trophies. As already stated, the team of De Jesus did not play that night. At about three o'clock, De Jesus received the prize of his team which placed third and was awarded a ball as the sportsmanship prize. Diamzon admitted that after midnight he hardly noticed the presence of De Jesus in the basketball court because he Diamzon was very busy. According to Fiscal Tombo, De Jesus denied that he saw Diamzon in the basketball court (3 tsn March 15, 1973). 


The issue is the credibility of the nine-year old victim, Lualhati Landayan, or whether appellant's guilt was established beyond reasonable doubt. 


We have painstakingly studied the evidence and appellant's arguments in his brief in order to ascertain whether there is any reasonable doubt as to his guilt. We agree with the trial court that he was definitely identified by the nine-year old rape victim and that his alibi is not sufficient to exculpate him. His presence in the basketball court after midnight did not render it impossible for him to commit the rape in the haystack about fifty meters away. 


One piece of evidence of the prosecution is pregnant with significance and dissipates any doubt as to the guilt of De Jesus 'm this case. That evidence is his confession to an NBI agent dated July 2, 1972 (Exh. H). The agent identified the confession during the trial in this case. De Jesus did not assail its voluntariness. In that confession, he admitted that before he was arrested in this case, he became obsessed with 
another child, named Aurora Santos
, whom he had met at the Lacson Underpass in Quiapo, Manila and who, coincidentally, resided near a 
basketball court and a chapel in Makati, Rizal.
 After Aurora's confidence, he raped and killed her in the evening of June 4, 1972 (thirteen days after the rape in this case) in one of the buildings of the University Of Santo Tomas (UST) near Dapitan Street, Manila. 


For that brutality he was indicted in the Circuit Criminal Court of Manila but the indictment was later dismissed by Judge Manuel P on the technicality that his confession was inadmissible. That confession reads in full as follows:

SUBSCRIBED AND SWORN to before me this 2nd day of July 1972 in the Office of the National Bureau of Investigation Taft Ave., Manila, Philippines. 




















(Sgd.) Illegible 


JOSE F. DELOS REYES 


Deputy Director for 


Investigative Services 


	NBI 


By authority of Republic Act 157) 
























The foregoing confession reveals that De Jesus, as admitted by him, has pedophiliac tendencies because he prefers young girls as sexual objects. The sexual deviation or perversion in the instant case and in the case described in the confession (Exh. H) belongs to the category of 
paedophilia erotica
 discussed by Krafft-Ebing in his 
Psychopathia Sexualis
. 


The confession, the detailed recitals of which could not have been fabricated, is evidence of similar conduct on the part of De Jesus which lends credibility to the declaration of Lualhati in this case that she was sexually abused by De Jesus (See sec. 48, Rule 130, Rules of Court). 


The NBI agent, who took the statement of De Jesus, testified in this case that De Jesus was the principal suspect in the case of Aurora Santos because of the testimonies of witnesses who saw him talking with the victim immediately prior to her disappearance as well as witnesses who saw the girl struggling to free herself from his clutches while he was carrying her in the UST campus (7 tsn January 29, 1973).


It is noteworthy that in Exhibit H, when De Jesus was asked whether he had a rape case other than that of Aurora Santos, he did not categorically deny that he raped Lualhati. His ambiguous answer was this: ""Tungkol ho kay Lualhati na ako naman ay suspect din diyan como ang kasong iyan ay nasa husgado na hamong (yaan) na po ang husgado na ang humatol sa akin"" (Question No. 50 in Exh. H). 


The crime committed in this case is simple rape falling under paragraph 3 of article 335 of the Revise Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act Nos. 2632 and 4111. It is punished by
 reclusion perpetua
. 


The indemnity of P165 imposed by the trial court should be raised to P12,000. 


WHEREFORE, the trial court's judgment is affirmed with the modification that the indemnity is raised to P12,000 and that the penalty imposed should be termed reclusion perpetua. Costs against the appellant. 


SO ORDERED.


Barredo (Actg. Chairman), Antonio, Concepcion Jr. and Santos JJ., concur. 


Fernando, J., is on leave.
