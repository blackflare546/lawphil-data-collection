AQUINO, 
J.:


This certiorari and prohibition case is about the parol evidence rule. 


On September 28, 1971, Carmen Myrick, Salvacion Myrick, and Celso, Josefina and Celerina, all surnamed Millabas, filed in the Court of First Instance of Albay a complaint to annul a supposed conditional donation of two parcels of land located at Comum Camalig, Albay, with areas of ""47-52"" and ""1-25-00"" square meters, a donation which they had allegedly made in !963 to the Philippine National Railways (PNR). 


The ground for the annulment was the alleged non-fulfillment of the five conditions of the donation (Civil Case No. 4507). No deed of donation or actionable document was annexed to the complaint. (See. sec. 7, Rule 8, Rules of Court.)


The PNR in its answer denied the donation for lack of sufficient knowledge thereof but it contradicted 'that denial by stating in its affirmative defenses that the donation was unconditionally made by the late Antonio J. A. Myrick and that the plaijtiffs are guilty of laches. No deed of donation was attached to the answer to sustain the defense that the donation was pure and unconditional. (In the complaint it was alleged that Antonio was deceased brother of plaintiffs Carmen Myrick and Salvacion Myrick but it was not alleged that he was the donor or that the plaintiffs are his legal heirs.)


At the hearing of the case on March 6 (11), 1974, while plaintiff Salvacion Myrick was testifying, she was asked to identify a deed of donation dated August 23, 1962 made by her brother, Antonio, which is reproduced below (Exh. B or 1):

It may be noted that the alleged donation was made in 1962 to the Manila Railroad Company that it was made by Antonio J. A. Myrick (Myrick) and not by the plaintiffs, now the private respondents; that the land donated is located at Barrio 
Taladong 
(not Comun) Camalig and that the area of the land donated is 6,188 square meters. 


After Salvacion Myrick had Identified the deed of donation quoted above, her counsel propounded the following questions: 








Q.	You said that you know of the execution of this Deed of Donation which is marked Exhibit 1 for the defendant and also marked as Exhibit B for the plaintiffs during the pre-trial, and which I am also adopting now that the same be marked Exhibit B for the trial on the merits, 


	Having known of the execution of this Deed of Donation. will not tell this Honorable Court why as a brother (sic) and co-heir of your late brother Antonio, why you did not sign in this Deed of Donation? 


A.	(of Salvacion Myrick) Because the Philippine National Railways should first comply with the promise in the donation. 


Q.	Will you tell this Court the promise of the PNR with respect to the execution of this Deed of Donation, Exhibit B 


A.	ATTY. ABELLERA (counsel of the PNR): I firmly object to the question. Counsel is trying to elicit oral evidence which is violative of the parol evidence rule. The Deed of Donation is very clear. It has no condition whatsoever. If the condition now is place on the record that will alter the condition of the donation. 








In view of that objection, the hearing was suspended. The trial court ordered the parties to submit memoranda on the issue of Whether or not that question should be allowed under the parol evidence rule. That issue remained pending until the lower court, through respondent Judge, resolved it ill the third of July 7, 1977, now being assailed herein. 


The lower court held that the question should be allowed the objection should be overruled because to allow the witness answer the question would not be a transgression of tilt parol evidence rule. 


We hold that, under the pleadings and considering the defense of lack of cause of action interposed by the PNR, that lower court committed a grave abuse of discretion in not sustaining petitioner's objection based on the parol evidence rule. That rule is found in Rule 130 of the Rules of Court which provides: 




SEC. 7.	
Evidence of written agreements
. — When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing, it is to be considered as containing all such terms and. therefore, there can be, between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of the terms The agreement other than the contents of the writing, except in the following case:


(a)	Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing, or it failure to express The true intent and agreement of the parties, or the of the agreement is put in issue by the pleadings; 


(b)	When there is an intrinsic ambiguity in the writing, 


The term 'agreement' includes wills.




Section 7 requires that in order that parol or extrinsic evidence may be admitted to vary the terms of the writing, the mistake or imperfection thereof or its failure to express the true intent and agreement of the parties should be put in issue by the pleadings. In the instant case, the plaintiffs did not expressly plead that the deed of donation was incomplete or that its execution was vitiated by mistake or that it did not reflect the intention of the donor and the donee. 


The plaintiffs in paragraph four of their complaint merely alleged that the donation was subject to five conditions. Then, they prayed that the donation should be annulled or rescinded for noncompliance with those conditions. 


At the trial they tried to prove those conditions by parol evidence. Obviously, they could not introduce parol evidence to vary the terms of the agreement because they did not plead any of the exceptions mentioned in the parol evidence rule. Their case is covered by the general rule that the contents of the writing constitute the sole repository of the terms of the agreement between the parties. 


Thus, it was held that where there is no allegation in the complaint that there was any mistake or imperfection in the written agreement or that it failed to express the true intent of the parties, parol evidence is inadmissible to vary the terms of the agreement (Villanueva vs. Yulo, 106 Phil. 1170). 


On the other hand, if the defendant set up the affirmative defense that the contract mentioned in the complaint does not express the true agreement of the parties, then parol evidence is admissible to prove the true agreement of the parties (Enriquez vs. Ramos, 11 6 Phil. 525, 531; Philippine Sugar E. D. Co. vs. Philippines, 62 L. Ed. 1177, 247 U. S. 385; Heirs of De la Rama vs. Talisay-Silay Milling Co., 54 Phil. 580, 588; Land Settlement and Dev. Corp. vs. Garcia Plantation Co., Inc., 117 Phil. 761, 765). 


The plaintiffs or their predecessor, the donor, Antonio J. A. Myrick, could have asked for the reformation of the deed of donation. Instead of doing so, they asked for its annulment or rescission on the theory that there was non-compliance with the supra resolutory conditions of the donation (See art. 764, Civil Code: Parks vs. Province of Tarlac, 49 Phil. 142). 


But whether the action is for revocation or reformation, it was necessary for the plaintiffs, in order to prove that the donation was conditional, to plead that the deed of donation did not express the true intent of the parties. Not having done so, their parol evidence on the alleged conditions is dismissible upon seasonable objection interposed during the trial by the donee's counsel. (Yu Tek & Co. vs. Gonzalez, 29 Phil. 384; Soriano vs. Cia. General de Tabacos de Filipinas, L-17392, December 17, 1966. 18 SCRA 999, 1015.) 


Other considerations may be adduced to fortify the holding that the plaintiffs cannot prove the conditional character of the donation. 


It should be observed that the action for annulment was brought by the alleged collateral relatives of the deceased donor. Their capacity to bring the action has not been specifically pleaded (See sec. 4, Rule 8, Rules of Court: Concepcion vs. Sta. Ana, 87 Phil. 787). 


The anomalous or odd situation in this case is that the plaintiffs belatedly filed an action to annul (not reform) a donation made by their collateral relative. Evidently, they had no copy of the deed of donation because they did not attach a copy thereof to their complaint. They were not cognizant of the terms thereof. They did not know the exact date of the donation and the description, location and area of the lands donated- They pretended that five conditions were engrafted on the deed of donation which to the does not take any condition at all. How they came to know of those conditions, when they were not the donors, was not pleaded in their complaint. 


The private respondents contend that the rulings ot a trial judge on the admission of evidence are reviewable on appeal and cannot be assailed by means of certiorari (Philippine Air Lines, Inc vs. Teodoro, 9 7 Phi1. 461); 


That is the general rule, Where, as in this case, petitioner's contention is clearly tenable and the lower court, in overruling the objection to the evidence, committed a patent mistake amounting to a grave abuse of discretion, the error may be corrected by means of certiorari (De Laureano vs. Adil, L-43345, July 29, 1976, 72 SCRA 148, 161). 


As to private respondents' contention in their memorandum in the lower court that Antonio J.A. Myrick was not the absolute owner of the donated properties See page 41 of Rollo). that ultimate fact should likewise have been alleged in their complaint, 


WHEREFORE, the trial court's order of July 7, 1977 is reversed and set aside. Costs against the private respondents. 


SO ORDERED. 


Fernando (Chairman), Barredo, Antonio and Santos, JJ., concur. 


Concepcion, J., took no part.
