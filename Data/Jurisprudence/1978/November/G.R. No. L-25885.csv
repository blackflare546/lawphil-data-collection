RESOLUTION ON SECOND

	MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 


 


TEEHANKEE, 
J.:


The Court denies appellant Maritime Building Co. Inc.'s (Maritime) Second Motion for Reconsideration of October 7, 1972 on the following grounds and considerations: 


1.	A party litigant is entitled to only one Supreme Court to adjudicate his suit and should not be permitted to keep a case pending by repetitious reiterations of the same contentions (already repeatedly and lengthily discussed by appellant and extensively dealt with and rejected by the Court in its decision of January 21, 1972 and extended resolution of August 18, 1972) in the expectation that his claim may eventually gain acceptance from vital changes in the Court's composition with the passage of time. 


2.	The second motion for reconsideration raises no new grounds but is merely a reiteration of the self-same arguments already found to be unmeritorious and rejected for the reasons and considerations extensively discussed in the Court's decision of January 31, 1972 (6 years and 8 months ago) and in the Resolution of August 18, 1972 denying the first motion for reconsideration. Such second motions for reconsideration are patently
 pro forma 
and serve no apparent purpose but to gain time and therewith vital changes in the Court's composition. Such dilatory motions should have long been denied in consonance with public interest and public policy which demand that judgments of courts determining controversies should not be left hanging but should become 
final
 at some 
definite
 time fixed by 
law
 or by a 
rule of practice 
recognized by law and that the Court's time and attention should not be inordinately diverted to this case which is of no special significance but is a ""mere adjudication of adversary rights between two litigants"" (although they may be of ""some substantial financial standing"" 
1
 
) to the prejudice of other cases in its fun docket which are still awaiting the Court's determination and judgment. 


3.	In the 81 volumes of Supreme Court Reports Annotated, there appears the preface written by now Chief Justice Castro wherein he stresses the importance of precedents and the governing principle of stare decisis which have given consistency and stability to the law."" The whole thrust of appellant's stand since the filing of the case on June 17, 1961 up to its pending 
second
 motion for reconsideration (seventeen years later) has been to ask the Court to disregard the rule of 
stare decisis
 and to 
overturn
 the long- standing doctrine of 39 years upholding the promissor's contractual right, as stipulated in contracts to 
sell
, to declare the contract cancelled upon breach thereof and the putative buyer's failure to pay the stipulated installments which is simply an event that prevent(s) the obligation of the vendor to convey title from acquiring binding force"" 
2
 and ruling that Article 1592 (formerly Article 1504) of the New Civil Code 
3


 (which grants the vendee of immovable property the right to pay even after the expiration of the period for payment despite a stipulation to the contrary, as long as no demand by suit or notarial act has been made upon him but further provides that ""after the demand, the Court may not grant him a new term"") does not apply to 
a contract to sell. 


The Court has seen no valid reason for yielding to the appellant's insistent importunings to cast aside the precedents (as an exception in its case) and to disregard the contractual stipulations, freely entered into by it with the assistance of counsel and with full awareness of the import of the covenanted terms and conditions and of the legal consequence of breach thereof in accordance with past precedents, as the binding law between the parties. 


4.	The governing law and precedents which demand denial of the second motion for reconsideration as stated and reiterated in the decision and resolution denying reconsideration may briefly be summarized thus: 


(a)	The contract between the parties was a contract 
to sell 
or 
conditional
 sale with title expressly reserved in the vendor Myers Building Co., Inc. (Myers) until the suspensive condition of full and punctual payment of the full price shall have been met on pain of automatic cancellation of the contract upon failure to pay any of the monthly installments when due and retention of the sums theretofore paid as rentals. When the vendee, appellant Maritime, willfully and in bad faith failed since March, 1961 to pay the P5,000. — monthly installments notwithstanding that it was punctually collecting P10,000.00 monthly rentals from the lessee Luzon Brokerage Co., Myers was entitled, as it did in law and fact, to enforce the terms of the contract to 
sell
 and to declare the same terminated and cancelled. 


(b)	Article 1592 (formerly Article 1504) of the new Civil Code is not applicable to such contracts to sell or 
conditional
 sales and no error was committed by the trial court in refusing to extend the periods for payment. 


(c)	As stressed in the Court's decision, ""it is irrelevant whether appellant Maritime's infringement of its contract was casual or serious"" for as pointed out in 
Manuel vs. Rodriguez
. 
4


(I)n contracts to sell, where ownership is retained by the seller and is not to pass until the full payment of the price, such payment, as we said, is a positive suspensive condition, the failure of which is not a breach, casual or serious, but simply an event that prevented the obligation of the vendor to convey title from acquiring binding force ..."" 
5
 


(d)	It should be noted, however, that Maritime's breach was far from casual but a most serious breach of contract: since the execution of the contract to sell on April 30, 1949, Maritime, after paying the P50,000. down payment, was merely 
paying
 for the balance of the purchase price in the sum of P950,000.00 with the 
property's own rental earnings 
of P13,000.00, later P10,000.00, a month from the lessee Luzon Brokerage Co. Maritime had as of the time of its willful refusal and failure to pay the stipulated installments of P5,000.00 a month collected a total of P1,500,000.00 in rentals from the property, out of which it had paid Myers P973,000.00 on account of both the principal and stipulated 5% interest per annum, 
6
 leaving still a 
substantial unpaid balance of P319,300.65
 on the principal with a 
net gain of P527,000.00
 out of the collected 
rentals
 alone for Maritime. Yet, Maritime had deliberately defaulted on the monthly installments due after its request for a suspension of payments until the close of 1961 had been expressly rejected ""
under any condition
"" by Myers and then nevertheless withheld the payments and gave Myers notice that it would ""
withhold any further payments
"" unless the heirs of the late F.H. Myers honored a totally unconnected alleged personal promise of the F.H. Myers to indemnify it for a possible liability of about P396,000.00 to a labor union in connection with a completely different transaction (which alleged liability was already barred against the estate of F. H. Myers and with which appellee Myers corporation had nothing whatsoever to do).


(e)	Even if the contract were considered an unconditional sale so that Article 1592 of the Civil Code could be deemed applicable, Myers' answer to the complaint for interpleader in the court below constituted a judicial demand for rescission of the contract and by the very provision of the cited codal article, 
7
 ""
after
 the demand, the court may not grant him a new term' for payment; and 


(f)	Assuming further that Article 1191 of the new Civil Code governing rescission of reciprocal obligations could be applied (although 
Article 1592
 of the same Code is 
controlling
 since it deals 
specifically
 with sales of real property"", said article provides that ""(T)he court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period"" and there exists 
no
 ""just cause"" as shown above, for the fixing of a further period. Assuming further that Article 1234 of the Civil Code which provides that ""(I)f the obligation has been substantially performed in good faith, the obligor may recover as though there had been a strict and complete fulfillment, less damages suffered by the obligee"" could be applied, Maritime cannot invoke its benefits because as shown above there has not been substantial performance on its part and it has been guilty of 
bad faith
 in defaulting on and withholding payment of the stipulated installments.


5.	The enactment on September 14, 1972 by Congress of Republic Act No. 6552 entitled ""An Act to Provide Protection to Buyers of Real Estate on Installment Payments"" (known also as the Maceda law) has now placed the 39-year old jurisprudence of this Court (recognizing the right of cancellation of the contract of conditional sale of real estate or on installments upon failure to pay the stipulated installments and retention or forfeiture as rentals of the installments previously paid) into the 
category
 of a 
law
 (insofar as industrial lots and 
commercial buildings
 as is the case at bar are concerned) which is now beyond overturning even by this Court. The Court cannot now 
deny
 or refuse to honor Myers 
contractual
 right of 
cancellation
 which is now reaffirmed and recognized by the law itself and is no longer a matter of precedents or doctrinal jurisprudence. 


6.	The plea for equitable considerations on behalf of Maritime has no basis in law and in fact. As shown above, it acted with 
dolo
 or bad faith and must bear the consequences of its deliberate withholding of, and refusal to make, the monthly payments, notwithstanding Myers' rejection of its request for suspension of payments, by asserting against Myers corporation (as if it had a right of offset) a 
totally unconnected
 alleged 
personal
 liability to it of the late F. H. Myers and seeking to burden Myers corporation for such liability which it could no longer collect from F.H. Myers. Maritime still came out of the cancelled contract with a net profit of P527,000.60 derived totally from the rental-earnings of the property. On the other hand, Myers acted but in consonance with law and equity and established precedents of 39 years standing in asserting its right of cancellation pursuant to the express provisions of the contract which constitutes the law between the parties, and the mandate of Article 1159 of the Civil Code that ""Obligations arising from contracts have the 
force of law
 between the 
contracting parties 
and should be 
complied
 with, in 
good faith
. As the Court stressed in 
Garcia vs. Rita Legarda Inc
. 
8
 ""when the contract is thus cancelled, the agreement of the parties is in reality being fulfilled. Indeed, the power thus granted can not be said to be immoral, much less unlawful, for it could be exercised - not arbitrarily - but 
only
 upon the other contracting party committing the 
breach
 of contract of non-payment of the installments agreed upon. Obviously, all that said party had to do to 
prevent
 the other from exercising the power to cancel the contract was for him to 
comply
 with his part of the contract"". This is aside from the fact that what is involved here is a pure 
business contract 
between two big real estate 
corporations
 and to paraphrase Justice Fernando 
9
 such a plea for equity would not elicit, especially from the higher tribunals, an affirmative response since considering their economic status they are ""very likely ... to be able to protect themselves in the clinches."" 


What follows now is an amplification of the above grounds and considerations which were stated in precise form or by way of a brief summary of the essential points for denying Maritime's second and pro forma motion for reconsideration which somehow remained pending in this Court for six (6) years now. 


1.	
A party is entitled to only one Supreme Court, vital changes in the Court's composition since 1972; Justice Barredo's dissent never gathered sufficient votes to reverse. 


A party litigant is entitled to only one Supreme Court to adjudicate his suit, but here over six years after this Court (the Concepcion Court 1966-April 17, 1973) had rendered the decision of January 31, 1972 affirming on appeal the trial court's decision and the resolution of August 18, 1972 denying reconsideration, the composition of the Court has so radically changed that out of the present membership of 
twelve
, only 
four
 members of the Court who took part in the original decision and resolution of January 31, and August 18, 1972 remain and this Court (the Castro Court, December 22, 1975) may truly be said to be in effect 
another
 Supreme Court. The very 
raison d'etre
 of courts, more so the Supreme Court, is to put an end to controversy and public policy and sound practice demand that no 
second
 motion for reconsideration be kept pending this long as to allow the litigant to speculate on changes in the membership of the Court and to have another Supreme Court review his lost case once more. 


(a)	The original decision at bar of 
January 31, 1972
 
10
 (penned by Justice J.B.L. Reyes, retired on August 19, 1972) affirming on direct appeal (prior to the effectivity of Republic Act 5440) the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila of November 26, 1965, was unanimously concurred in by nine members of its ten-member composition then namely, (Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, Makalintal (A.C.J. April 17, 1973, C.J. October 24, 1973 to Dec. 22, 1975), Zaldivar, Castro, (now C.J.) Teehankee, Barredo, Villamor and Makasiar, JJ. with Justice Fernando having inhibited himself and not taking part. 


(b)	This same Court with a full membership of eleven 
denied
 appellant's motion for reconsideration of March 27, 1972 in its extended and signed 8-page Resolution of 
August 18, 1972
 
11
 (penned by Justice J.B.L. Reyes on the eve of his retirement in consonance with the Court's tradition of the ponente disposing with the Court of pending motions for reconsideration before his retirement). A majority of six of the 
original nine
 Justices, namely Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, Makalintal (in the result), Castro, Teehankee and Makasiar, JJ. concurred in the resolution. Justice Barredo, however, dissented with an 86-page opinion and was joined by Justice Zaldivar and a new member Justice Antonio (appointed on April 10, 1972). Justice Fernando maintained his inhibition and took no part, while the eleventh member Justice Esguerra (a new member appointed on June 21, 1972 to fill the vacancy left by Justice Villamor who retired on April 12, 1972) likewise inhibited himself and did not take part. 


(c)	It is readily seen that during the pendency for six (6) years of appellant's second motion for reconsideration of October 7, 1972 the Court's composition has seen vital changes. Only 
four
 of the original 
10-member 
Court that rendered the decision of January 31, 1972 are still members, namely, now Chief Justice Castro, and Justice Teehankee, Barredo and Makasiar. As noted above, Justice Fernando had inhibited himself and did not take part in the case. 


(d)	
In the six-year
 interval, the Court's membership was increased to fifteen and the retirement age of new appointees reduced to 65 years under the 1973 Constitution. 
Ten (10) new members
 joined the Supreme Court in this interval (all after the 1973 Constitution except the first two named), as follows: Antonio, Esguerra (retired on June 19, 1976), Estanislao Fernandez (retired on March 28, 1975), Muñoz Palma, Aquino, Concepcion Jr., Martin (retired on January 12, 1978), Santos, Ramon Fernandez and Guerrero, JJ., so that in effect this is another Supreme Court. There is no call for such special treatment for a simple private case — of no public import at all — of cancellation of a conditional sale effected in accordance with the contract between the parties which has the 
binding force of law
 between them and which is backed up by the
 39-year standing jurisprudence 
of this Code now confirmed and 
given statutory force
 by the Maceda law. 


(e)	Maritime's second motion for reconsideration violates the warning given by the Court in 
Zarate vs. Director of Lands
 
12
 that litigants should 
not
 be ""allowed to 
speculate
 on changes in the personnel of the Court"" and to keep importuning the Court for ""
reagitation, reexamination and reformulation
."" Although stated in support of the principle of the ""law of the case"" this warning is equally and specially applicable to motions for reconsideration, particularly a second motion for reconsideration, when vital changes have taken place in the Court's membership as has happened: 






... Without the rule there would be 
no end to criticism, reagitation, re-examination 
and 
reformulation.
 In short, there would be 
endless
 litigation. It would be, 
intolerable
 if parties litigant were allowed to 
speculate
 on 
changes
 in the personnel of a court, or on t chance of our
 rewriting propositions
 once gravely ruled on solemn argument and handed down as the law of a given case. An itch to reopen questions foreclosed on a first appeal would result in the foolishness of the inquisitive youth who pulled up his corn to see how it grew, Courts are allowed, if they so choose, to act like ordinary sensible persons. The administration of justice is a practical affair. The rule is a practical and a good one of frequent and beneficial use. (Mangold v. Bacon, 237 Mo. 496). 






(f)	Withal let it be noted that during this period of six years as vital changes in its membership were taking place, periodic tentative votes were taken on the pending second motion for reconsideration and on no occasion were there ever mustered the required eight votes to support Justice Barredo's dissent and to reverse the original decision. (Of the writer's own knowledge, even Justice Zaldivar who had joined Justice Barredo's dissent in the August 18, 1972 resolution denying reconsideration had expressed second thoughts about such dissent and was ready to rejoin the original majority, when he compulsory retired from the Court on September 13, 1974). 


2.	
Second motion for reconsideration is pro forma — ""a mere dilatory strategy"" which should have been given short shrift long ago. 


(a)	Maritime's 
second
 motion for reconsideration has raised no new grounds or special circumstances not available at the time of the filing of the 
first
 motion for reconsideration but is merely a reiteration of reasons and arguments or amplification thereof which have already been considered, weighed and resolved adversely and which serve no apparent purpose but to gain time and therewith possible changes in the Court's composition. As invariably held by the Court, such second motions which are based on grounds already existing at the time of the first motion are clearly pro forma. 
13
 


As such
 pro forma
 motion for reconsideration (although with leave) such second motion deserves no further consideration and should be denied in consonance with the Court's consistent stand against multiplicity of motions (Rule 52, sec. 1) in the interest of avoiding further delay in the remand of a case already decided and to avoid needless slowdowns in the Court's disposition of other cases in its full docket which are more deserving of its study and attention. Cases entitled to preferential attention under the law have incurred in delay because of the inordinate time and attention this case has received, including the preparation and submittal 
intra-Court
 of extensive research papers and memoranda. 


(b)	As has ever been stressed since the early case of 
Arnedo vs. Llorente 
(18 Phil. 257, 263 [1911])"" controlling and irresistible reasons of 
public policy
 and of 
sound practice in the courts 
demand that at the risk of occasional error, judgments of courts determining controversies submitted to them should become 
final
 at some 
definite time
 fixed by 
law
, or by a 
rule of practice
 recognized by law, so as to be thereafter beyond the control even of the court which rendered them for the purpose of correcting errors of fact or of law, into which, in the opinion of the court it may have fallen. The very purpose for which the courts are organized is to
 put an end to controversy
, to decide the questions submitted to the litigants, and to determine the respective rights of the parties."" 


(c)	Now Chief Justice Castro succinctly restated the 
pro forma
 doctrine in 
Dacanay vs. Alvendia
 thus: ""
Mere citation and/or amplification of authorities
 not previously brought to the court's attention 
on the same argument 
does not remove the pleading from the ambit of the 
pro forma
 doctrine. The Rules of Court, looking with disfavor on piecemeal argumentation, have provided the 
omnibus motion
 rule, whereunder ""(A) motion attacking a pleading or proceeding shall include an objections then available, and all objections 
not so included
 shall be deemed waived."" The salutary purpose of the rule is to 
obviate multiplicity of motions
 as wen as 
discourage dilatory pleadings
. As we said in 
Medran vs. Court of Appeals
, 'litigants should not be allowed to reiterate Identical motions, 
speculating
 on the
 possible change of opinion
 of the Court or 
of the judges thereof.
' The mere citation of additional authorities by the petitioner in his last motion for reconsideration reiterating his thrice-rejected Identical arguments as to the sufficiency of his amended complaints did not salvage the said motion from the proper application thereto of the 
pro forma 
doctrine."" 
14
 


(d)	Justice Barredo in 
Lucas vs. Mariano
 
15
 emphasized that ""it is in the 
public interest and consistent with the public policy, that controversial rights in property be settled as soon as possible
 in order to
 promote stability 
in all matters affected thereby"" and that a second motion for reconsideration which contains ""mere iterations and reiterations of the same points and arguments over and over again ... becomes, in effect, a mere dilatory strategy and consequently nothing more than 
pro forma 
"" The pertinent excerpts from said case are fully applicable, 
mutatis mutandis
 to the case at bar: 






Looking at this case from other angles, however, the Court is inclined to agree with private respondents that the order of dismissal of September 16, 1965 has already become final and executory. Taking all relevant matters into consideration, We are loathe to let this litigation to protract further. Involving as it does the ownership and possession of a rather large piece of residential land, it is in 
the public interest and consistent with the public policy, that controversial rights in property be settled as soon as possible
, in order to
 promote stability
 in all matters affected thereby that this case is terminated right here in this proceeding, it being within the authority of this Court to do so in the premises. 


Not only have petitioners had 
enough occasions and opportunities to present their main contentions and to be heard amply on them
, but, more than that, We see no possibility that their pretensions, whether factual or legal, can prosper. In their complaint in the court below, as well as in their various motions for reconsideration in relation to as many of its orders and their oppositions to the motions for reconsideration also on the part of private respondents, petitioners have 
as often lengthily discussed and explained repeatedly their position as to all aspects of their claim
 of title. We have gone over all these representations and We find them to be 
mere iterations and reiterations of the same points and arguments over and over again
. Thus both the first and second motions for reconsideration of petitioners respectively dated November 5, 1965 and January 25, 1966 raised exactly the same issues as their opposition to the motions to dismiss separately filed by private respondents. When the opportunity to appeal to a higher court is open to a party aggrieved by an order of an inferior court, tribunal, commission or body, our procedural rules allow the filing of only one motion for reconsideration of its final order and judgment, and a second motion may be filed only when there is need to raise new points or matters not touched upon in the first motion, since otherwise, litigations will unnecessarily drag in the trial courts to the obvious detriment of the interests of justice not only in the particular case on hand but more so in the other cases pending in the court which cannot be attended to. As earlier noted, 
a second motion for reconsideration is actually a motion for reconsideration only of the order of denial of the first motion and if it does not raise any new issue relative to the first order, naturally, it cannot affect the legality and validity thereof, and becomes, in effect, a mere dilatory strategy and consequently, nothing more than pro forma
 An 
attempt
 to have a reconsideration of the denial of a previous plea for reconsideration is 
not conducive
 to a speedy administration of justice. After all, the party aggrieved has a more effective recourse by appealing immediately to the appropriate appellate tribunal. 






In the lower courts, the 
pro forma
 motion does not stop the period for appeal from slipping away — and results in the judgment sought to be appealed becoming final and executory. In this Court, the 
pro forma
 first and/or second motion for reconsideration (although with leave of Court) — which merely reiterate the same grounds already considered and resolved in its decision or resolution denying due course (as the case may be) — have similarly been treated and the decision or resolution sought to be reconsidered have invariably been denied with a declaration of finality and entry of judgment, by virtue of ""controlling and irresistible reasons of public policy and of sound practice in the courts"" which demand an end to litigation at some definite point of time as a ""fundamental concept in the organization of civil society."" 
Interest republicae ut sit finis litium

3.	
The governing principle of stare decisis. 


In each volume of Supreme Court Reports Annotated, Chief Justice Castro's preface cites the governing principle of precedents and 
stare decisis
 ""which has given 
consistency
 and 
stability
 
to the law
"" by which lawyers and litigants may know the law in concrete controverted cases, thus: 






In his famous essay, the 
Path of the Law
, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes defined law as a prediction of what the court will do. 


The prediction is based on 
precedents
. The governing principle, which has given 
consistency
 and 
stability to the law
, is
 stare decisis et petition quieta movere
 (follow past precedents and do not disturb what has been settled). 


The officials enforcing statutory law and regulations, the 
lawyers
 and 
litigants
 seeking to know the 
law
 in 
concrete controverted cases
, and the judges in adversary litigations, should be well posted on 
precedents
. 






Such precedents and jurisprudence of this Court form part of our 
legal system
 by force of the provision of Article 8 of the new Civil Code that ""Judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines"" and may not be lightly treated. 


Reconsideration may not be granted without doing violence to this cardinal principle and overturning well established principles and provisions of law such as 
freedom of contract
 which is the law between the parties as provided by Article 1306 of the Civil Code 
16
 the 
right of a vendor
 in contracts to sell or conditional sales with reserved title to cancel the sale upon failure of the vendee to pay the stipulated installments and retain the sums already paid (which has now been elevated into the category of a law in the case of
 industrial and commercial 
real properties as in this case by the Maceda law, and which not even this Court can now overturn) and that he who pleads for equity must come to court with clean hands.


4.	The governing law and precedents. 


The governing law and established precedents which demand peremptory denial of the second motion for reconsideration have been hereinabove stated, 
supra
.
17
 
Suffice it to herein underscore the following. 


(a)	As stated in the Court's decision, the vendor's right in contracts to sell with reserved title to extrajudicially cancel the sale upon failure of the vendee to pay the stipulated installments and retain the sums or installments already received has long been recognized by the well-established doctrine of 39 years standing. ""(T)he 
distinction
 between contracts
 of sale
 and contracts to 
sell
 with reserved title has been 
recognized
 by this Court in 
repeated
 decisions (Manila Racing Club vs. Manila Jockey Club, 69 Phil. 57; Caridad Estates vs. Santero, 71 Phil. 114; Miranda vs. Caridad Estates, L-2077, 3 October 1950; Jocson vs. Capitol Subdivision, L-6573, 28 February 1955; Manuel vs. Rodriguez, 109 Phil. 1; see also Sing Yee Cuan, Inc. vs. Santos [C App.] 47 O. G. 6372) upholding the power of promisors under contracts to sell in case of failure of the other party to complete payment, to
 extrajudicially terminate the operation
 of the contract,
 refuse conveyance
 and 
retain the sums
 or installments already received, where such rights are expressly provided for, as in the case at bar."" 
18
 


(b)	In the Resolution of August 18, 1972, Justice J.B.L. Reyes further stressed for the Court that: ""(M)ovant Maritime's insistence upon the application to the present case of Art. 1191 of the Civil Code of the Philippines (tacit resolutory condition in reciprocal obligations) studiously ignores the fact that Myers' obligation to convey the property was expressly made subject to a 
suspensive
 (precedent) condition of tile punctual and full payment of the balance of the purchase price."" 


He cited the express stipulations of the contract of conditional sale thus: 






(d)	It is hereby agreed, covenanted and stipulated by and between the parties hereto that the Vendor will execute, and deliver to the Vendee 
a definite or absolute deed of sale upon the full payment
 by the Vendee of the 
unpaid balance of the purchase
 price hereinabove stipulated; that should the Vendee
 fail to pay any of the monthly installments, when due
, or otherwise fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions herein stipulated, then this 
deed of conditional sale shall automatically
 and without any further formality, 
become null and void
, and all sums so paid by the Vendee by reason thereof, shall be considered as rentals and the vendor shall then and there be free to enter into the premises, take possession thereof or sell the properties to any other party.


xxx			xxx			xxx


(i)	
Title to the properties subject of this contract remains with the Vendor
 and shall pass to, an be transferred in the name of the Vendee
 only upon complete payment of the full price
 above agreed upon. (Emphasis supplied).






He had previously cited in the decision the acceleration clause in the contract that: ""... the failure to pay any installment or interest when due shall ipso facto cause the 
whole
 unpaid balance of the principal and interest to be and become
 immediately due and payable
."" 
19
 


He thus articulated the inescapable conclusion that the express contractual stipulations ""make it crystal clear that the full payment of the price (through the punctual performance of the monthly payments) was a condition 
precedent
 to the execution of the final sale and to the transfer of the property from Myers to Maritime; so that there was to be no actual sale until and unless full payment was made. It is uncontroverted that none was here made. The upshot of all these stipulations is that in seeking the ouster of Maritime for failure to pay the price as agreed upon, Myers was
 not rescinding
 (or more properly, 
resolving
) the contract, but precisely enforcing it according to its express terms,"" citing from the well known Spanish commentators, Castan and Puig Pena. 


(c)	The Resolution of August 18, 1972 likewise clearly disposed of Maritime's contention that its breach of contract was casual thus: ""there is no point in discussing whether or not Maritime's breach of contract was casual or serious, since the issue here is whether the suspensive condition (of paying P5,000.00 monthly until full price is paid) was or was not fulfilled, and it is not open to dispute that the stipulated suspensive condition 
was left unaccomplished through the deliberate actions of movant Maritime. The stubborn fact is that there can be no rescission or resolution of an obligation as yet non-existent, because the suspensive condition did not happen
. 


Resolving Identical arguments, as those of Maritime, this 
Court ruled in Manuel vs. Rodriguez
. 109 Phil. 9-10, as follows: 






... Plaintiff-appellant, however, argues (Errors I-IV; VI; VIII) that the Payatas Subdivision had no right to cancel the contract, as there was no demand by suit or notarial act, as provided by Article 
1504 of the old Code (Art. 1592
, N. C. C.). This is without merit, because Article 1504 requiring demand by suit or notarial act in case the vendor or realty wants to rescind, does not apply to a contract to sell or promise to sell, where title remains with the vendor until fulfillment to a positive suspensive condition, such as full payment of the price (Caridad Estates vs. Santero, 71 Phil. 114, 121; Albea vs. Inquimboy, 86 Phil. 476; 47 OFF. Gaz. Supp. 12, p. 131; Jocson vs. Capitol Subdivision Inc. et al., L-6573, February 28, 1955; Miranda vs. Caridad Estates, L-2077 and Aspuria vs. Caridad Estates, L2121, October 23, 1950). 


The contention of plaintiff-appellant that Payatas Subdivision inc. had no right to cancel the contract as there was only a 'casual breach' is likewise untenable. In contracts to sell, where ownership is retained by the seller and is not to pass until the full payment of the price, such payment, as we said, is a positive 
suspensive
 condition, the failure of which is not a breach, casual or serious, but simply an even that prevented the obligation of the vendor to convey title from acquiring binding force, in accordance with Article 1117 of the Old Civil Code.
 To argue that there was only a casual breach is to proceed from the assumption that the contract is one of absolute
 sale, where non-payment is a resolutory condition, which is not the case. 






(d)	It should also be appreciated that Maritime's breach of contract, far from being casual, was of the gravest character. As stated above, this was pure business contract between two real estate corporations where Maritime as conditional vendee got the
 most liberal terms
 and was 
purchasing
 the property 
out
 of the
 property's rental earnings
 with plenty to spare for its own gains. Thus, it was receiving the 
rentals
 from the property of 
P10,000.00 a month (or P120,000.00 per annum)
 and had only to pay punctually the stipulated monthly
 installments of only P5,000.00 
a month (or P60,000.00 per annum leaving it with a clear 
superavit
 of P60,000.00 every year). Under these circumstances, the 
only
 condition demanded by Myers as vendee was that Maritime pay religiously the monthly installments when due under pain of automatic voiding of the contract for non-fulfillment of the suspensive (precedent) condition of punctual and full payment of the balance of the purchase price. 


Yet, Maritime willfully and deliberately defaulted on the payments due since 
March, 1961
 notwithstanding that its request for a suspension of payments until the end of 1961 had been expressly rejected ""under any condition"" by Myers and notwithstanding that it was collecting from the lessee Luzon Brokerage Co. the corresponding rentals of P10,000.00 monthly for March, April and May, 1961 or a total of P30,000.00 (
double
 the amount of the stipulated monthly installments due from it). Worse, it injected a 
totally unconnected 
alleged personal promise of the late F.H. Myers to indemnify it for a possible liability to a labor union of some P396,000.00 in connection with a completely separate transaction totally unrelated to their contract to sell and gave notice that it was ""withholding any further payments"" unless the heirs of the deceased honored his claim, notwithstanding that it was already barred against the deceased's estate which had already been closed. 


As further noted in the Court's Resolution of August 18, 1972, ""(M)aritime's 
bad faith
 is further confirmed by Schedler's letter to his counsel informing the latter that the attorneys in the United States were trying to reopen the closed Myers' estate to be able to file a contingent claim therein. And yet he was already seeking to burden Myers' Corporation with that very obligation."" 


(e)	Maritime's breach of Contract therefore was most serious: 


1.	It refused to pay the monthly installments from March to May, 1961 totalling P15,000.00 notwithstanding that 
it had the money 
and had 
collected
 the corresponding rentals in double the amount of P30,000.00 for said months. (The trial court's judgment as affirmed by this Court consequently sentenced Maritime
 inter alia
 to pay Myers ""the sum of P30,000.00 representing rentals wrongfully collected by (Maritime) from the plaintiff in interpleader corresponding to the months of March, April and May, 1961"";


2.	Its 
unpaid balance
 on account of the purchase price amounted to almost one-third of the stipulated price in the sum of 
P319,300.65 
which besides the stipulated interest became immediately 
due and payable
 under the contract's acceleration clause; 


3.	Having breached the contract, Maritime completely foiled Myers' plans for investment and utilization of the monthly installments as due. Worse, Maritime 
did not honor 
either its obligation extrajudicially to return the property, so much so that since March, 1961 Myers could not avail of the fruits and rentals of its reserved title which had then reverted absolutely to it with the cancellation of the contract, so much so that the lessee Luzon Brokerage Co. had to file the interpleader below and all the rentals which properly belong to Myers as owner since then have been 
tied up
 in Court for 
seventeen
 
(17) long years
 to the present. 


4.	And it is the height of irony for Maritime to plead now that the accumulated rentals on the property — which it had prevented Myers from rightfully making use of as the lawful owner all these seventeen (17) long years come up to seven figures — to contend that after all it had willfully failed only to pay the three months' installments in March to May, 1961. This is not all Maritime failed to pay. It also failed to pay the 
whole unpaid balance of P319,300.65
 besides the stipulated interests which under the acceleration clause became 
immediately
 
due
 and 
payable
 upon default. The rentals that Luzon Brokerage Co. as plaintiff in interpleader deposited monthly with the trial court beginning June, 1961 were not sufficient at the time of default in March 1961 to pay — this unpaid balance. But the whole irony of it is that these rentals belonged no longer to Maritime but 
solely
 and 
wholly to Myers
 as the 
lawful owner
 in whom its reserved title had 
reverted
 by virtue of the cancellation of the contract due to Maritime's willful and deliberate default with 
dolo
.


5.	As the Court pointed out in 
Garcia vs. Rita Legarda, Inc
. 
20
 the buyer on installments has only himself to blame for the power of cancellation ""could be exercised - not arbitrarily — but 
only
 upon the other party committing the breach of contract of
 non-payment
 of the installments agreed upon"" and that to avoid the stipulated and foreseen consequences of cancellation and forfeiture of all previous payments all that (the buyer) had to do ... was to 
comply
 with (its) part of the bargain. Having failed to do so, (it) really have no valid reason to complain"". Parenthetically, due to the most liberal terms of the contract, Maritime here, despite cancellation and forfeiture of all previous installments in the concept of rentals, still came out of the transaction with 
a gain of P527,000.00
 and a 
net
 gain of 
P514,000.00
 after deducting the P13,000.00 in stipulated damages and attorneys' fees granted by the trial court's decision as affirmed by this Court due to Myers having had to avail of judicial recourse to enforce its right of cancellation and regain possession of its property.


(f)	Finally, 
no case 
can be cited where this Court has denied the vendor on installments the stipulated right of cancellation of the contract to sell or of sale on installments of 
industrial
 or 
commercial
 real estate with forfeiture of an previous payments upon breach of the contract by failure to pay the stipulated installments when due in line with the long line of precedents above cited. As discussed in the next following part, this right of cancellation in the case of 
industrial
 and 
commercial
 properties is now expressly recognized in the Maceda law. 


(g)	The agitation by Maritime for reexamination of the Court's 39-year old doctrine of the vendor's right of extrajudicial cancellation with forfeiture of previous payments (assuming that it is not barred by the enactment of R.A. 6522) cannot be properly done in this case which was decided more than six (6) years ago (on January 31, 1972 with reconsideration denied in the extended Resolution of August 18, 1972) and been frequently 
cited authoritatively
 in law books and treatises including Maritime's counsel, former Senator Ambrosio Padilla's extensive Annotations on the Civil Code and the Philippine Law Journal's Survey of Philippine Law and Jurisprudence 
21
 citing anew the ""important distinction"" drawn by this Court between a contract of sale and a contract to sell, to which latter contract Article 1592 of the Civil Code has always been held to be inapplicable. The bench and bar would needlessly be subjected to confusion if now this case which has been cited for over 6 years as maintaining the 39-year old doctrine re cancellation of contracts to sell should all of a sudden no longer be a valid authority. 


The Court itself has rejected pleas for reexamination of the doctrine in petitions filed after this Court's decision and Resolution of August 18, 1972 at bar citing Justice Barredo's dissent in support thereof, as in the petition in L-44593 entitled 
Lim Hu vs. Court of Appeals
, wherein the Court denied the petition per its Resolution of March 18, 1977 
22
 and denied reconsideration per its Resolution of June 6, 1977. 
23
 


5.	
R.A. 6552 (Maceda Law) expressly recognizes vendor's right of cancellation of sale on installments of industrial and commercial properties with full retention of previous payments. 


(a)	The enactment on September 14, 1972 by Congress of Republic Act No. 6552 entitled ""An Act to Provide Protection to Buyer of Real Estate on installment Payments"" which
 inter alia
 compels the seller of real estate on installments (but 
excluding industrial lots, commercial buildings
 among others from the Act's coverage) to grant one month's grace period for every one year of installments made before the contract to sell may be cancelled for non-payment of the installments due forecloses any overturning of this Court's long-established jurisprudence. Republic Act 6552 
recognizes
 in conditional sales of 
all
 kinds of real estate (industrial and commercial as well as residential) the non-applicability of Article 1592 (1504)Civil Code to such contracts to sell on installments and the right of the seller to cancel the contract (in accordance with the established doctrine of this Court) upon non-payment ""which is simply an event that 
prevents the obligation of the vendor
 to convey title from 
acquiring binding force
."" (Manuel vs. Rodriguez, 109 Phil. 1, 10, per Reyes, J.B.L.). The Act in modifying the terms and application of 
Art. 1592 Civil Code reaffirms
 the vendor's right to cancel 
unqualifiedly
 in the case of ""
industrial lots
 and 
commercial
 buildings (as in the case at bar) and requires a grace period in other cases, particularly residential lots, with a refund of certain percentages of payments made on account of the cancelled contract. 
24
 


(b)	Since 
Congress has through R.A. 6552 adopted into law
 the 39-year jurisprudence of the Court and recognized that in the sale of 
industrial lots and commercial buildings 
(as in the case at bar), non-payment of installments is simply an event that 
prevents
 the conditional obligation of the vendor to convey title from acquiring binding force and entitles the vendor to 
cancel
 the conditional contract, the Court 
can no longer 
overturn the doctrine long enunciated by it for 39 years since 
it would
 be in 
effect overturning the law itself. 
Certainly, the Court cannot deny Myers' right of cancellation recognized by the 
law
 itself. 


(c) 	Justice Barredo explained and premised his extensive 86-page dissent, as follows: 






Considering that Our decision in this case is a 
unanimous one 
penned by no less than
 Justice J.B.L. Reyes 
whose views on the
 legal issues
 We have resolved are 
admittedly authoritative
, ordinarily, my concurrence in a denial resolution should be practically a matter of course. After going over the motion for reconsideration, however, my curiosity was aroused by it principally on two points, namely, (1) the unhappy and helpless plight of
 thousands upon thousands of subdivision buyers 
who under the ruling We laid down are bound to suffer the loss of their life earnings only because of an oversight or difficulty in paying one or two installments, unless We firmed up the doctrine laid down by the Chief Justice in 
Javier
 or We made clearer their right to avail of Article 1592 of the New Civil Code under so called contracts or promises to sell which are in vogue in subdivision sales; and (2) the clarification once and for all of the 
juridical concepts
 We have been adopting in Our decisions concerning promises or contracts to sell with reservation of title, lest We perpetuate a posture in doctrinal law which may be questioned later. 
25
 






(1)	Congress in enacting in September 1972 Republic Act 6552 (the Maceda law), has by law which is its proper and exclusive province (and not that of this Court which is not supposed to legislate judicially) has taken care of Justice Barredo's concern over ""the unhappy and helpless plight of thousands upon thousands of subdivision buyers"" of 
residential
 lots. 


The Act even in 
residential
 properties recognizes and reaffirms the vendor's right to cancel the contract to sell upon breach and non-payment of the stipulated installments but requires a grace period after at least two years of regular installment payments (of one month for every one year of installment payments made, but to be exercise by the buyer only once in every five years of the life of the contract) with a refund of certain percentages of payments made on account of the cancelled contract (starting with fifty percent with gradually increasing percentages after five years of installments). In case of
 industrial and commercial properties
, as in the case at bar, the Act 
recognizes
 and 
reaffirms
 the Vendor's right 
unqualifiedly
 to cancel the sale upon the buyer's default. 


(2)	As to the clarification of ""juridical concepts"", the decision and resolution penned by Justice J. B. L. Reyes are quite clear that in cases of contracts to sell with reserved title, non-payment of the stipulated installment is simply the failure of a positive suspensive condition - an event that prevents the conditional obligation of the vendor to convey title from acquiring binding force and entitles the vendor to cancel the conditional contract. Justice Barredo's premise that there was no such thing as a promise to sell under the Spanish Civil Code and that Article 1478 of the Philippine Civil Code (1950) providing that ""ART. 1478. The parties may stipulate that ownership in the thing shall not pass to the purchaser until he has fully paid the price"" is an entirely new concept not recognized in the Spanish Civil Code is with all due respect a misconception and error, for said Article 1478 merely incorporated in the Philippine Civil Code a principle long recognized in Spanish in Philippine jurisprudence. The Court's decision and Resolution of August 18, 1972 cited Castan, Derecho Civil, Vol. 3, 7th Ed. page 129 and Pairo's Teoria de Obligaciones, the line of Philippine decisions prior to the effectivity in 1950 of the Philippine Civil Code, as well as decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain, all holding to the same effect that:






El repetido convenio de 
no
 quedar transferido al comprador el
 dominio completo
 de la hasta el completo pago del precio envuelve sustancialmente
 una verdadera condicion suspensiva 
TS Sent. 11 March 1929) (Emphasis supplied).


El vendedor por razon de esta reserva solo transmite el difrute de la cosa entrega mientras el precio no sea totalmente entregado (TS. sent. 7 March 1906). 
26






(d)	Justice Barredo's reply re the enactment of R.A. 6552 (the Maceda law) on September 14, 1972 is that it ""need not be considered because it is based on the new Civil Code"" (1950) and not on the old Code which was in force at the time that the parties executed their contract in 1949. This is not quite the case.


The point is that Congress thru R.A. 6552 adopted and elevated into 
law
 the 39-year old jurisprudence and now reaffirms as law the doctrine held by the Court since 1939 (when it first ruled that Article 1504 [now Article 1592] of the Civil Code is 
not
 applicable to contracts to sell or conditional sales). In other words, Congress could have overturned the doctrine by providing nevertheless that there can no longer be an automatic cancellation upon the buyer's default and failure to pay the stipulated installments, i.e. by outlawing this standard provision in tens if not hundreds, of thousands of such installments contracts. Since such standard right of cancellation of the sale upon the buyer's default with the seller's retention of all previous payments (sustains Myers' cancellation of the sale, as has always been upheld by this Court) has now been expressly recognized and ratified by the law. it is now — beyond this Court's power to reexamine and overturn its said doctrine (with the end of denying Myers' right of cancellation) since such right is now recognized and reaffirmed by the law itself and not even this Court can overturn and go against the law itself. (
In sensu contrario
, and this is where Justice Barredo's reply would have relevance, if RA 6552 had outlawed the seller's right of cancellation, since it was enacted only in September, 1972. it certainly would be open to the grave question of whether it could retroact and negate buyer's right of cancellation of the sale as recognized under the Court's established doctrine). 


6.	
No basis for plea for equitable considerations, — on balance, Maritime comes off the cancellation with a net gain of over P500,000.00 from the property's rental earnings; contract is pure business contract between two big real estate corporations and their contract is the law between them; corporations are not people and their business is simply business. 


(a) 	There is no basis for the plea for equitable consideration petitions and even Justice Barredo in his memorandum to the Court of July 27, 1978 that ""I am not aware that there is any such appeal [for equity] in the record."" His thesis is that the Court's rulings in 
Tuason vs. Javier
, 31 SCRA 829 and 
Legarda vs. Saldaña,
 55 SCRA 324 which involved small residential subdivision lots be applied to this
 million-peso transaction between two big real estate corporations
 on the premise that ""(T)o insist that the ruling applied in one case should also be applied in another where the facts are similar and to disregard the difference in the economic positions of the parties involved is not an appeal for equity but for plain legal justice."" Javier's case involved a small 
residential
 subdivision lot with a price of P3,691.20 and the Court in the interest of justice and equity granted the buyer an additional period of sixty days since the buyer had substantially complied with the contract 
in good faith
. 
27
 Saldaña's case in turn involved the purchase of two small 
residential
 lots and the Court found that ""the appellate court's judgment finding that of the total sum of P3,582.06 (including interests of P 1,889.78) already paid by respondent (which was more than the value of two lots), the sum applied by petitioners to the 
principal alone
 in the amount of P 1,682.28 was already more than the value of one lot of P 1,500.00 and hence one of the two lots as chosen by respondent would be considered as 
fully paid
, is fair and just and in accordance with law and equity,"" while the cancellation of the sale for the other lot due to failure to pay the installments was upheld. 
28
 It should be noted that the buyer Saldaña therein ""adhered to the 
validity
 of the 
doctrine
 of the 
Caridad Estates
 
cases
 (Caridad Estates vs. Santero, 71 Phil. 114; Miranda vs. Caridad Estates, L-2077, Oct. 3, 1950)"" but disputed its applicability contending inter alia that the sellers ""were equally in default as the lots were completely under water ..."" 
29


It is patently seen that there is no parity nor justification for applying said cases to the one at bar. The said cases involved merely 
small residential subdivision lots
 where the price had been in fact substantially paid in good faith and the Court's ruling therein was the precursor to the enactment of RA 6522 which provided certain measures of protection for the buyers of 
residential
 lots but 
recognized and reaffirmed
 the vendor's 
right of cancellation
 of contracts to 
sell without refund
 of previous payments upon the buyer's default in sales of 
commercial and industrial properties, 
as in the case at bar.


(b) 	The Court expressly found no basis for the application of equity under the facts of the case at bar, thus:






Maritime also pleads that as the stipulated forfeiture of the monthly payments already made is in fact a penalty, and the same should be equitably reduced. We fin(t no justification for such reduction for the following reasons: 


a)	Maritime 
intentionally
 risked the penalty by 
deliberately refusing
 to make the monthly payments for March to May, 1961, and trying to inject into its contract with Myers corporation the 
totally unconnected 
personal promise of F. H. Myers to indemnify its eventual liability to the Luzon Labor Union, allegedly made on the occasion of the sale of the Luzon (Stevedoring) to E. Schedler by F. H. Myers, and trying to 
extrajudicially force 
Myers corporation to assume responsibility for such liability. 


b)	Under Article 1234 of the present Civil Code, an obligation must be 
substantially
 performed in 
good faith
, for such performance to stand in lieu of payment, Maritime, on the contrary, acted with dolo or bad faith, and is not a position to invoke the benefits of the article. 


c)	Maritime's loss of the forfeited payments was more than balanced by the rentals it received from the Luzon Brokerage as lessee of the building for the corresponding periods, at a rate of 
double
 the 
monthly payments
 required of Maritime under its contract with Myers. 
30






In terms of pesos and centavos, Maritime received a total amount of some P1,500,000.00 from the property's own rental earnings. By virtue of its willful default and the resulting cancellation of the sale, the 
P973,000.00
 previously paid by it to Myers 
out
 of the 
same rental earnings
 as 
installments
 on account of the principal and interest (with an unpaid 
balance
 of 
P319,000.65
 representing still almost 1/3 of the principal agreed price) were retained by Myers as rentals in turn from Maritime under the express terms of their contract, since Maritime was the one collecting the rentals from the property's lessee at 
double
 the rate of its installments and continued to do so until May, 1961 despite its default three months earlier in May. Still, Maritime came out of the cancelled sale with 
excess earnings
 from the property's 
rentals of P527,000.00
 Maritime really has no valid reason to complain of having lost the right to the property and the larger share of the rentals — for all that ""(it) had to do ... was to comply with its part of the bargain. 
31
 


(c) The injunction of how Chief Justice Castro in 
Dy Pac Workers Union vs. Dy Pac & Co. Inc.
 
32
 that ""equitable considerations ... cannot offset the demands of public policy and public interest which are also responsive to the tenets of equity"" is controlling here, 
viz
: ""(T)he equitable considerations that led the lower court to take the action complained of 
cannot offset
 the demands of 
public policy
 and 
public interest
 — which are also responsive to the tenets of equity — requiring that 
all issues passed
 
upon
 in decisions or final order that have become executory, be deemed 
conclusively disposed
 
of
 and 
definitely closed
, for, otherwise, there would be 
no end to litigations
, thus setting at naught the 
main role 
of courts of justice, which is to assist in the 
enforcement of the rule of law
 and the maintenance of peace and order, by settling justiciable controversies 
with finality
.""


(d) 	This is out a case involving two big real estate corporations which entered into the contract to sell with the assistance of counsel and with 
full awareness
 of the import of the covenants, terms and conditions expressly stipulated and of the legal consequences of non-compliance therewith. Their 
contract
 is the 
binding law
 between them and equity cannot be pleaded by one who has not come with clean hands nor complied therewith in good faith as mandated by Article 1159 of the Civil Code (
supra
, page 5) but instead willfully and deliberately breached the contract and refused to pay the stipulated installments despite prior rejection ""under any condition"" of its request for suspension of payments and its having collected the property's rentals out of which it could easily pay the stipulated installments. 


This suit represents a mere adjudication of 
private
 adversary rights between two litigants with no significance in terms of doctrinal value since Maritime only pleads that it be given special treatment and that the cancellation of its contract be somehow rejected notwithstanding Myers I clear and incontrovertible right under the contract and the law to do so and Maritime's willful and deliberate breach of the contract in bad faith. 


Justice Fernando's observation in 
Chemplex vs. Pamatian
 
33
 that ""
struggles between prototypes of what was referred to by Roosevelt as economic royalists, do not automatically elicit, especially from the high tribunals, an affirmative response 
to the plea that they be heard""; that ""
the morality of the business world is not the morality of institutions of rectitude like the pulpit and the academe""; and ""... It is not the interest of the parties 
as such, but the significant it possesses in terms of its doctrinal value, that supplies the criterion. Chafee had occasion to refer to an opinion of Justice Frankfurter which implies that what is 
decisive is a question of import for public policy presented
, not a mere adjudication of adversary rights between the two litigants. At any rate, such a mode of viewing the matter is not likely to be productive of injustice to the 
main protagonists
 before us who, considering their
 economic status
, are 
very likely
, to paraphrase that caustic but realistic critic of law and of life, Professor Rodell,
 to be able to protect themselves in the clinches
,"" may well be heeded.


As was recently observed, ""it's time to put an end to the fiction that corporations are people."" 
34
 The business of big corporation such as the protagonists at bar is business. they are bound by the law contracts that they enter into and they do not ask for the nor are they entitled to considerations of equity.


For a final note of the writer. While the vote of Justice Fernando to grant the second motion for reconsideration when heretofore he has inhibited himself and did not take part in the decision of January 31, 1972 and Resolution of August 18, 1972 has not proven to be decisive, the writer took exception and herein makes of record his objection to the participation of Justice Fernando. This is done in all objectivity and with all due respect. If he had inhibited himself before from taking part in the decision and resolution against Maritime presumably for valid reasons, the writer feels that we are entitled to know whether those reasons no longer exist and he feels uninhibited now to vote for Maritime and granting its second motion for reconsideration. The writer is all too aware of his views shared with some other member(s) of the Court that their inhibition or disqualification is a matter of their own personal decision and conscience notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 137 of the Rules of Court which they consider in a way as not applicable to member of the Supreme Court. This delicate question has heretofore not been addressed nor resolved by the Court ... 
35
 
and should be determined once and for all for the guidance of the bench and bur and the litigants in court.


ACCORDINGLY, and for lack of the necessary votes (five votes for denying the second motion and seven votes for granting the same 
36
 , appellant Maritime's second motion for reconsideration is denied and this denial is final.


Makasiar, Muñoz Palma and Guerrero, JJ., concur.


Castro, C.J., on the basis of the Court's decision of January 31, 1972 (43 SCRA 93) and the Court's resolution of August 18, 1972 (46 SCRA 38 1), I vote to deny the wond motion for reconsideration.


Fernando, J., concurs in the dissent of Justice Barredo and, in addition, submits a brief opinion.


Barredo, J., voted to grant the second motion for reconsideration for the reasons stated in a separate opinion.


Antonio, Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Santos and Fernandez, JJ., voted to grant the second motion for reconsideration.
