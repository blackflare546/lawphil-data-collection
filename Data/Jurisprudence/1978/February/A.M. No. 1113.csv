FERNANDO, 
J.:


The ethics of the legal profession demands that a lawyer entrusted with funds coming from a third party should exercise the utmost care and prudence. He is subjected to strict accountability, and rightly so. It is expected of him that honesty and fair dealing should characterize his actuations. Failure to do so is a ground for discipline action. The administrative complaint in this case filed by Conrado Custodia Sr. and his wife Sanita, against respondent Ireneo Z. Esto, a December of the Philippine Bar, alleged in brief that the latter representing the complaints in a prosecution for rape and abduction against Conrado Custodia Jr. and one for trespass to dwelling against his father, the matter then pending before the City Fiscal Office of Manila, obtained P1,000 from the Custodia spouses, with the promise that such charges would be dropped. That promise, so it is asserted, was not fulfilled Neither was the money returned, even after demand. The administrative complaint characterized what was done by respondent all constituting ""deceit, malpractice, or gross misconduct. 
1
 His suspension or disbarment is sought. 


The answer denied any wrongdoing on his part, that the Custodia knew ""that the complaints in the City Fiscal's Office could not be dismissed because the alleged offended parties did not want to have an amicable settlement."" 
2
 
It Was rather evasive, however, as to the of the P1,000, the answer merely stating the following. That respondent likewise denies the allegations contained in b 10 of the complaint the truth of the matter being that when respondent received the letter of demand he was t o know why petitioners should seek legal assistance, and after he received such letter, it came to the mind of the respondent to go out from the gentlemen's agreement not to make the offer of compromise as evidence against the respondents in I.S. Nos. 72-10120 and 72-13398 and for which reason he sought the advice of the Investigating Fiscal about the matter and the latter advised the respondent that he can still use this incident as evidence against the petitioners in mid case but to return the said amount to the petitions herein; that further, the respondent withdrew the sum of P1,000.00 from his Bank Account, which was the very money he admitted on September 8, 1972, and brought it to the same of Fiscal Santos on September 19, 1972 in order to return the same to the petitioners but they faded to appear during said hearing and considering that the respondent received a copy of the letter complaint of the petitions to the Solicitor General on September 20, 1972, the respondent deemed it wise to let the petitioners get the money from his office personally, as he was then approve of and risking the loss of a big sum of money; or else, subject the same to the of the investigating Fiscal or whatever resolution this Honorable Court may desire; ...""

The administrative complaint was then reffered to the Of. office of the Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation Such report was submitted by the then Acting Solicitor General now Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, Hugo Gutierrez, Jr.

 on October 25, 1976. 


This is its finding of facts: ""There is no dispute that respondent Atty. Esto received the amount of P1,000.00 from complaints Conrado Custodia Sr. and Sanita Custodia. There is likewise no the that the amount was Paid to respondent for the purpose of settling the caw of forcible abduction with rape lodged against Conrado Custodia Jr. upon complaint of Favorite, and the case of to dwelling filed against Conrado o Sr. upon complaint of Diosdado Favorite, both of which were then pending investigation at the Manila Fiscal Office, with the complaints being repeated thereon by herein respondent Atty. Ireneo Z. Esto. When, according to the complainants, they handed the amount of P1,000.00 to respondent in the latter's office in the hope of settling the cases but without the presence of the Favorites who were the complainants against them, they were fully aware that the projected settlement was not a certainty and therefore could fail, otherwise the payment would have been made to the Favorites personally or at least in their presence and with their conformity. So that it was no surprise at all to the complainants that the expected settlement did not materialize."" 
5
 


""The only issue,"" the Report continues, ""is, whether respondent was recreant as a lawyer in not effecting the return of the money to the complainants soon after it was plain that the Favorites were not amenable to the proposed settlement. Whereas, complainants aver that they sought repeatedly the respondent, albeit in vain, for the purpose of recovering the amount stated, respondent on the other hand, claims that he made several offers to return the sum to the complainants, but the latter rejected the same unless the charges filed against them by respondent's clients were dropped. Credibility therefore is involved. In resolving the same, we are inclined to give credence to respondent's version that the complaints refused to receive the money unless the cases against them (Custodios, Sr. and Jr.) were first dismiss Respondent has manifested sincere desire to return the amount. If complainants were indeed willing to accept the same, this case would not have gone this far. Moreover, complaints did not rebut the evidence of the respondent that on several occasions, the latter tried to return the money to the former."" 
6
 


There is in such report a fair and just appraisal of the conduct of respondent. It reads thus: ""But respondent is not totally free from blame. Soon after the prospect of an amicable settlement had fizzled out, he should have excused more prudence in effecting the return of the money. As his previous attempts to do so failed, he should have resorted to other avenues if only to have the amount restored to the complainants. It would have barred him out of all suspicions of bad faith."" 
7
 


It came as a surprise therefore when the recommendation was for respondent Esto to ""be given a stem warning against any repetition of what was co ed of herein."" 
8
 That was all This Court did not see it that way. It is much too light considering the infraction committed. Accordingly the case was set for hearing on January 20, 1978. Respondent Esto appeared in his own behalf The complainants were represented by Miss Blesila Quintillan a trial attorney of the Office of the Solicitor General. Thereafter, this Court resolved ""to require the complainants to [submit] a manifestation within five (5) days from today as to whether or not the P1,000.00 has been returned to them. 
9
 On January 25, 1978, this Manifestation was submitted by Assistant Solicitor General Nathanael P. de Pano, Jr.: ""[Come now] the undersigned counsel and in compliance with the instruction of this Honorable Court during the hearing of the above-entitled case, hereby respectfully manifest: That after the hearing of the above-entitled case on January 20, 1978, it was agreed upon by the parties that the payment of the amount of P1,000 by the respondent to the complaints as ordered by this Honorable Court, shall be coursed through the office of the undersigned Solicitor; That in compliance with said agreement, respondent deposited with the undersigned Solicitor today, January 25, 1978, the aforesaid sum of P1,000 to be delivered to the complaints; That up to this writing, the complaints have not claimed the aforesaid amount from the undersigned Solicitor although they are expected to appear anytime today to receive the same as earlier agreed upon."" 
10
 


In thus returning the amount, respondent member of the bar had taken an affirmative step in the direction of respectability. It can be said he had partially atoned for his undesirable conduct. It can further be said that he had come to that the rigorous ethics of the profession places a premium on honesty and condemns duplicitous conduct. This Court however feels that he had not fully expiated his offense. At the very least, a severe reprerimand is indicated. It should serve as a warning at any member of the bar, who under analogous circumstances might be tempted to behave similarly. That is an eventuality to be avoided and guarded against.


WHEREFORE, Attorney Ireneo Z. Esto is severely reprimanded and admonished to exercise greater mm and prudence in the future in his actuations as a member of the Philippine Bar. Let a copy of this resolution be spread on his record.
