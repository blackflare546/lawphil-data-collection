G.R. No. L-2853            August 30, 1906


THE UNITED STATES,
 plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


MELECIO FLORES,
 defendant-appellant.


Maximino Mina, for appellant.

Office of the Solicitor-General Araneta, for appellee.


TRACEY, 
J.:


The conviction of the defendant for rape is based upon the testimony of the complainant alone, inasmuch as the two other witnesses for the prosecution corroborate her testimony on unimportant points only, not in dispute. Her story is contradicted by the accused and is inconsistent in detail. In cases of this kind the evidence of the complainant to justify the conviction of the defendant must be clear and must be corroborated (U.S. 
vs
. Mamintud,
1
 August 16, 1906), otherwise it fails to satisfy beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by U. S. 
vs
. Dacotan ( 1 Phil., Rep., 669). 


The complaint in this case should be dismissed and the defendant discharged with costs 
de oficio
. So ordered.


Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, Carson and Willard, JJ.,
 concur.
