G.R. No. L-3094	December 12, 1906


FRED SPARREVOHN,
 plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


EMIL M. BACHRACH, ET AL.,
 defendants-appellants. 


Bishop and O'Brien for appellants. 


W. L. Wright for appellee. 




WILLARD, 
J.:


The plaintiff brought this action upon the following document: 




$271.

I. O. U.

Two Hundred and Seventy-one.

(Sgd.) E. H. B.




The defendant in his answer alleged that this obligation was given for money lost at a game of poker and that game was a game of chance prohibited by the law. Article 1798 of the Civil Code is as follows: 




The law does not permit any action to claim what is won in a game of chance, luck, or hazard; but the person whose loses can not recover what he may have voluntarily paid, unless there should have been fraud, or should he be a minor or incapacitated to administer his property.




While the defendant, as has been said, alleged that the game of poker was a game covered by article 1798, there was no proof in the case to support this allegation. No evidence was offered to show the nature of the game. Without such evidence the court can not assume that it was a game of 
suerte, envite, or azar
. 


It will be noticed that no consideration is mentioned in this obligation. By the terms of article 1277 of the Civil Code, therefore, it is presumed that a consideration existed and that it was lawful, unless the defendant prove the contrary. The case differs in this respect from the case of 
Lichauco vs. Martinez 
1 
(5 Off. Gaz., 89), decided November 6, 1906, in which a consideration was expressed, which consideration was proven by the defendant to be false.
