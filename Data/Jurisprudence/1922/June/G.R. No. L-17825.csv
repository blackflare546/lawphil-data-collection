(Fdos.) FELISA ROMAN VDA. DE MORENO
U. DE POLI


Firmado en presencia de:

(""Acknowledged before Notary"")




Exhibit D is a warehouse receipt issued by the warehouse of U. de Poli for 576 bales of tobacco. The first paragraph of the receipt reads as follows:




Quedan depositados en estos almacenes por orden del Sr. U. de Poli la cantidad de quinientos setenta y seis fardos de tabaco en rama segun marcas detalladas al margen, y con arreglo a las condiciones siguientes:




In the left margin of the face of the receipts, U. de Poli certifies that he is the sole owner of the merchandise therein described. The receipt is endorced in blank ""Umberto de Poli;"" it is not marked ""non-negotiable"" or ""not negotiable."" 


Exhibit B and C referred to in the stipulation are not material to the issues and do not appear in the printed record. 


Though Exhibit A in its paragraph (
c
) states that the tobacco should remain in the warehouse of U. de Poli as a deposit until the price was paid, it appears clearly from the language of the exhibit as a whole that it evidences a contract of sale and the recitals in order of the Court of First Instance, dated January 18, 1921, which form part of the printed record, show that De Poli received from Felisa Roman, under this contract, 2,777 bales of tobacco of the total value of P78,815.69, of which he paid P15,000 in cash and executed four notes of P15,953.92 each for the balance. The sale having been thus consummated, the only lien upon the tobacco which Felisa Roman can claim is a vendor's lien. 


The order appealed from is based upon the theory that the tobacco was transferred to the Asia Banking Corporation as security for a loan and that as the transfer neither fulfilled the requirements of the Civil Code for a pledge nor constituted a chattel mortgage under Act No. 1508, the vendor's lien of Felisa Roman should be accorded preference over it.


It is quite evident that the court below failed to take into consideration the provisions of section 49 of Act No. 2137 which reads: 




Where a negotiable receipts has been issued for goods, no seller's lien or right of stoppage in transitu shall defeat the rights of any purchaser for value in good faith to whom such receipt has been negotiated, whether such negotiation be prior or subsequent to the notification to the warehouseman who issued such receipt of the seller's claim to a lien or right of stoppage in transitu. Nor shall the warehouseman be obliged to deliver or justified in delivering the goods to an unpaid seller unless the receipt is first surrendered for cancellation.




The term ""purchaser"" as used in the section quoted, includes mortgagee and pledgee. (See section 58 (
a
) of the same Act.) 


In view of the foregoing provisions, there can be no doubt whatever that if the warehouse receipt in question is negotiable, the vendor's lien of Felisa Roman cannot prevail against the rights of the Asia Banking Corporation as the indorse of the receipt. The only question of importance to be determined in this case is, therefore, whether the receipt before us is negotiable. 


The matter is not entirely free from doubt. The receipt is not perfect: It recites that the merchandise is deposited in the warehouse ""por orden"" instead of ""a la orden"" or ""sujeto a la orden"" of the depositor and it contain no other direct statement showing whether the goods received are to be delivered to the bearer, to a specified person, or to a specified person or his order. 


We think, however, that it must be considered a negotiable receipt. A warehouse receipt, like any other document, must be interpreted according to its evident intent (Civil Code, arts. 1281 
et seq
.) and it is quite obvious that the deposit evidenced by the receipt in this case was intended to be made subject to the order of the depositor and therefore negotiable. That the words ""por orden"" are used instead of ""a la orden"" is very evidently merely a clerical or grammatical error. If any intelligent meaning is to be attacked to the phrase ""Quedan depositados en estos almacenes por orden del Sr. U. de Poli"" it must be held to mean ""Quedan depositados en estos almacenes a la orden del Sr. U. de Poli."" The phrase must be construed to mean that U. de Poli was the person authorized to endorse and deliver the receipts; any other interpretation would mean that no one had such power and the clause, as well as the entire receipts, would be rendered nugatory. 


Moreover, the endorsement in blank of the receipt in controversy together with its delivery by U. de Poli to the appellant bank took place on the very of the issuance of the warehouse receipt, thereby immediately demonstrating the intention of U. de Poli and of the appellant bank, by the employment of the phrase ""por orden del Sr. U. de Poli"" to make the receipt negotiable and subject to the very transfer which he then and there made by such endorsement in blank and delivery of the receipt to the blank. 


As hereinbefore stated, the receipt was not marked ""non-negotiable."" Under modern statutes the negotiability of warehouse receipts has been enlarged, the statutes having the effect of making such receipts negotiable unless marked ""non-negotiable."" (27 R. C. L., 967 and cases cited.) 


Section 7 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, says: 




A non-negotiable receipt shall have plainly placed upon its face by the warehouseman issuing it 'non-negotiable,' or 'not negotiable.' In case of the warehouseman's failure so to do, a holder of the receipt who purchased it for value supposing it to be negotiable may, at his option, treat such receipt as imposing upon the warehouseman the same liabilities he would have incurred had the receipt been negotiable. 


This section shall not apply, however, to letters, memoranda, or written acknowledgments of an informal character.




This section appears to give any warehouse receipt not marked ""non-negotiable"" or ""not negotiable"" practically the same effect as a receipt which, by its terms, is negotiable provided the holder of such unmarked receipt acquired it for value supposing it to be negotiable, circumstances which admittedly exist in the present case. 


We therefore hold that the warehouse receipts in controversy was negotiable and that the rights of the endorsee thereof, the appellant, are superior to the vendor's lien of the appellee and should be given preference over the latter. 


The order appealed from is therefore reversed without costs. So ordered.
