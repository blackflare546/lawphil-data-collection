When arraigned, the accused, Rene C. Henson pleaded, ""not guilty,"" to the charge.


The prosecution thus presented its case.


On 16 June 1993, at around six o'clock in the evening, the victim Mae Chille Aguilar, then only a child of six years of age, went to the house of accused Rene C. Henson, a neighbor, at Burgos-Ramos Street, Bacolod City. There, the victim started sweeping the ground floor; when she finished, she proceeded to the second floor. The accused saw Mae. He held her by the hand and led her to his bedroom. He made her lie down and remove her shorts and underwear. The accused himself then reclined on the floor, unzipped his pants and pulled it down with his underwear. He went on top of her and made up and down movements, slightly penetrating her and causing some pain to the innocent victim. 
2


Having satisfied his lust, the accused withdrew. The victim put on her panty and shorts and went down the house. 
3


The prosecution presented Analyn Aguilar, ten years old and a first cousin of Mae, 
4
who testified that the accused was her uncle, in whose house she and her mother, the accused's sister, also stayed. 
5
 Analyn said that she, together with one Jesmer Aguilar, executed a joint affidavit in Visayan dialect, dated 16 June 1993, attesting to the sexual intercourse between the accused and Mae Chille. On cross-examination, Analyn gave further details. She declared that at around six o'clock in the evening of 16 June 1993, she and her twelve-year old cousin Errol Aguilar, were at the front yard of their house picking cheriza from a tree. 
6
 She heard strange sounds coming from the house.
7
 She went upstairs and peeped through a hole on a plywood wall that separates her room from that occupied by the accused. The young witness caught accused still unzipping his pants before going on top of the victim. 
8
 Analyn rushed down and called Jesmer Aguilar. The two went up to Analyn's room and peeped through the hole. 
9
 This time, they saw Mae being made to stay on top of the accused. 
10
 Jesmer and Analyn dashed from the house to report to their grandfather what they had just witnessed. 
11
 The old man, visibly shaken, told Analyn and Jesmer to fetch the victim and to inform their ""Tita"" Myrna, the victim's mother, of the incident. 
12
 Their ""Tita"" Myrna, accompanied by their grandfather, then went to the police headquarters to lodge a complaint.


Dr. Jose Mari Salvador, a resident physician at the Department of Surgery of the C.L. Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital, testified that he had examined the victim, and that while the victim did not appear to have experienced penetration in her genitalia, her hymen still being intact and no spermatozoa having been found, 
13
 there, however, were abrasions at the left and right inner lip of the external genitalia and on the right thigh that could have been caused by a male organ from an attempt of forcible entry into the vaginal part. 
14


Rene C. Henson took the witness stand and denied having been at anytime with Mae Chille Aguilar on 16 June 1993. He testified that he was at home only until about 5:20 in the afternoon of 16 June 1993 when he went to the Iglesia ni Kristo Church at Manalo Street, located about 300 meters away from his house, to attend a church meeting. The meeting ended at around 7:00 that evening but he stayed for night guard duty from 8:00 in the evening to 4:00 in the morning of the following day. He was home at about 9:00 in the morning of 17 June 1993 after having gone first with the church pastor to Murcia. Henson added that when he left their house on 16 June 1993, his niece Maribel Toreja was still in the house. He attributed the ""false accusation"" against him to a grudge entertained by the victim's mother with whom he had an altercation at one time and by Analyn Aguilar because he used to scold her for fighting back with her elder sister.


In an attempt. to prove his 
alibi,
 the accused presented Maribel Toreja who testified that at about 5:00 in the afternoon of 16 June 1993 she arrived at the house of the accused and that the latter left the house before 5:30 in the afternoon; Arsenio Santillan, the security guard of the Iglesia ni Kristo compound at Manalo Street who stated that the accused arrived in the church premises at around 5:30 in the afternoon to attend the 
""purok""
 meeting in the evening of 16 June 1993; and Alfredo Martillano, Jr., an employee of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (""BIR"") and a resident of Magsaysay Avenue, Singcang, Bacolod City, who stated that he conducted a 
""pulong panata""
 on 16 June 1993 which started at exactly 6:00 in the afternoon, and that the accused was in attendance.


When trial concluded, the Regional Trial Court of Negros Occidental, Sixth Judicial Region, Bacolod City rendered a decision, dated 10 May 1994, convicting Rene Henson; 
viz
:




WHEREFORE, the Court finding the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of committing the offense of statutory rape upon the person of the minor child under the circumstance prescribed in Article 335 No. 3 of the Revised Penal Code, hereby sentences said accused to suffer the penalty of 
RECLUSION PERPETUA.
 The accused is further ordered to indemnify the victim the sum of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages; P10,000.00 as exemplary damages and to pay the costs.


SO ORDERED.
15




In his appeal to this Court, Rene Henson submits a lone assignment of error, 
i.
e.,
 that the ""Court 
a quo
 erred in convicting the accused-appellant of the crime charged,"" 
16
 predicating his defense mainly on 
alibi.


Regrettably, the defense thesis is much too flaccid to stay firm against the weighty evidence for the prosecution. Understandably, courts have received the defense of denial and concomitant 
alibi
 with considerable caution, because this submission is inherently weak and unreliable, one that too easily can be put forward. 
17


There is even greater reason to be guarded than usual at this time. Accused-appellant claims to have been at the Iglesia ni Kristo ""puro"" meeting at or about the time of the incident. The venue of 
alibi
 is just a few minutes of walk away from the crime scene. Accused-appellant himself has admitted that the distance between the Iglesia ni Kristo church and his house is only about 300 meters. 
18
 For the defense of 
alibi
 to prosper, the accused should prove not only that he was at some other place when the crime was committed but that it would have been likewise physically impossible for him to be at the 
locus criminis
 at the time of its commission. 
19


Furthermore, his 
alibi
 cannot stand against the positive identification made by Mae. 
20
 The identity of accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime of rape has been so established by the clear, convincing and straightforward testimony of Mae. Thus —

21




A candid narration by a victim of rape can bear the earmarks of

credibility, 
22
 particularly where no motive is attributed to the rape victim that would make her testify falsely against the accused. 
23


Corroborating the victim's testimony was that of Analyn Aguilar, ten years old, niece of accused-appellant himself, who testified:

A Yes, Sir.

A He is my uncle, Sir.

A (Witness pointing on the knees.)


Q Aside from that, what did you see?


A I saw him lie down on top of Mae Chille.


Q That was the only thing you saw after the accused removed his short pants?


A No, Sir, I saw him with his penis drawn out as he lie on Mae Chille.

A In both position, when he was lying on top of Mae Chille and also while he himself lie on the floor, he was doing that all the time.


Q What was then the position of Mae Chille when Rene Henson was lying flat at his back?


A I saw again Mae Chille lying on top of him.
 
25




It is of no moment that the rape victim offered no resistance; the gravamen of the offense of statutory rape is in having carnal knowledge with a girl under twelve years of age.
ℒαwρhi৷
 
26
 When the victim is below 12 years of age, the consent, or lack of it, by the girl to have carnal embrace is irrelevant. 
27


Lastly, aside from the fact that no evidence has been presented by accused-appellant to prove any possible fabrication of the accusation, it is hard to believe that a mother would sacrifice her own daughter and present her to be the subject of a public trial if she, in fact, has not been motivated by an honest desire to have the culprit punished. 
28
 It would be unnatural for a parent to use her own daughter to unnecessary embarrassment and stigma. 
29


There appears to be no room for doubt but that accused did, indeed, commit the act complained of.


WHEREFORE,
 the conviction of accused-appellant 
RENE C. HENSON
 by the Regional Trial Court of Negros Occidental, 6th Judicial Region, Bacolod City of the crime of statutory rape is 
AFFIRMED
 
in toto.
 Costs against accused-appellant.
