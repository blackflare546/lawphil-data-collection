vs.


RENERIO P. VERGARA, ERNESTO T. CUESTRA, JR., PEDRO G. DAGAÑO and BERNARDO P. CUESTRA, accused. RENERIO P. VERGARA, 
accused-appellant.




VITUG, 
J.:


From the decision, dated 10 February 1993, of the Regional Trial Court, 8th Judicial Region, Branch 7, in Tacloban City, finding accused Renerio P. Vergara guilty beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 92-09-508 of a violation of Section 33 of Presidential Decree (""P.D."") No. 704, as amended by P.D. No. 1508, an appeal to this Court has been interposed.


Vergara was charged, together with his three co-accused, namely Ernesto T. Cuesta, Jr., Pedro G. Dagaño and Bernardo P. Cuesta, on 25 September 1992, in an information that read:




The undersigned Provincial Prosecutor of Leyte accuses Ernesto T. Cuesta, Jr., Pedro G. Dagaño, Renerio P. Vergara and Bernardo P. Cuesta of the crime of Violation of Section 33, Presidential Decree No. 704, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1058, committed as follows:


That on or about the 4th day of July, 1992, in the Municipal waters of Palo, Province of Leyte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused, without any authority of law, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally catch, take and gather fish belonging to the anchovies species known locally as ""bolinao"", with the use of 
explosives
 contained in a bottle and called in the vernacular as ""badil"", which bottled explosives after being ignited and hurled to the sea, produced explosion and caused the death of the said fish which were hit or affected by such explosion.


CONTRARY TO LAW.
1




Vergara alone was arraigned and brought to trial; his co-accused escaped and remained at larger.




It would appear that at about 7:30 in the morning of 04 July 1992, a team composed of deputized Fish Warden and President of the Leyte Fish Warden Association Jesus P. Bindoy, Police Officers Casimiro Villas and Diosdado Moron of the Palo PNP Station, Leyte, Fish Wardens Mario Castillote and Estanislao Cabreros and Fish Examiner Nestor Aldas of the Department of Agriculture were on board, ""
Bantay-Dagat,
"" a pumpboat, on ""preventive patrol"" along the municipal waters fronting 
barangays
 Baras and Candahug of Palo, Leyte, when they chanced upon a blue-colored fishing boat at a distance of approximately 200 meters away. The boat, 30 feet long, had on board appellant Renerio Vergara and his three co-accused Bernardo Cuesta, Pedro Dagaño and Ernesto Cuesta, Jr., and was on parallel course toward the general direction of Samar.
2
 Momentarily, the team saw appellant throw into the sea a bottle known in the locality as ""
badil
"" containing ammonium nitrate and having a blasting cap on top which, when ignited and thrown into the water, could explode. The explosion would indiscriminately kill schools and various species of fish within a certain radius. Approximately three seconds after appellant had thrown the ""
badil
"" into the sea, the explosion occurred. Vergara and Cuesta dove into the sea with their gear while Dagaño and Cuesta, Jr., stayed on board to tend to the air hose for the divers.
3


The team approached the fishing boat. SP02 Casimiro Villas boarded the fishing boat while Fish Warden Jesus Bindoy held on to one end of the boat. Moments later, Vergara and Cuesta surfaced, each carrying a fishnet or ""sibot"" filled with about a kilo of ""
bolinao
"" fish scooped from under the water. Having been caught red-handed, the four accused were apprehended and taken by the patrol team to the ""Bantay-Dagat"" station at Baras, and later to the police station in Palo, Leyte. The fishing boat and its paraphernalia, as well as the two fishnets of ""
bolinao,
"" were impounded. The accused, however, refused to sign and acknowledge the corresponding receipts therefor.


On 10 February 1993, following the submission of the evidence, the trial court rendered judgment convicting Vergara, 
viz
:




WHEREFORE, said Renerio Vergara is hereby sentenced to a penalty of Twenty (20) years to, life imprisonment as punished under Sec. 2, of PD 1058.


This Court further orders the confiscation of the fishing boat of Mario Moraleta including the following equipments: 1 air compressor, 3 sets of air hoses, and the 3 pieces of ""sibot"" having been found to be instruments of the crime.


SO ORDERED.

In his appeal, Vergara submitted the following assignment of errors:




1. THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF AUTHORITY WHEN IT COMPLETELY IGNORED THE TESTIMONY OF EMILIO LINDE.


2. THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF AUTHORITY WHEN IT GAVE MUCH WEIGHT TO BIASED WITNESSES WHOSE TESTIMONIES WERE GLARINGLY INCONSISTENT.


3. THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF AUTHORITY WHEN IT 
OPENLY
 SHOWED BIAS AGAINST THE ACCUSED DURING THE TRIAL OF THIS CASE. 
5




Emilio Linde sought to corroborate the claim of appellant that it was another unidentified group of fishermen who threw the bottle of explosives at a school of ""
bolinao
"" fish. It was obvious, however, said the trial court, that the statement of this defense witness was incredulous since he apparently had not at ail been on board the fishing boat in the company of the accused at the time of the incident. Even the rather lengthy counter-affidavit of the four accused completely missed to mention Linde. The court 
a quo
 went on to observe that the demeanor of the accused at the witness stand and the substance of his testimony failed to elicit belief.


Trial courts are tasked to initially rule on the credibility of witnesses for both the prosecution and the defense. Appellate courts seldom would subordinate, with their own, the findings of trial courts which concededly have good vantage points in assessing the credibility of those who take the witness stand. Nevertheless, it is not all too uncommon for this Court, in particular, to peruse through the transcript of proceedings in order to satisfy itself that the records of a case do support the conclusions of trial courts.
