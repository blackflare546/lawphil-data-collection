The Facts




The facts of the case, as narrated by the trial court, are as follows:
6




. . . At about 9:30 in the evening of December 26, 1992, accused William Burton y Robert, 30 years old, a British national, checked in at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), Pasay City, for his trip to Sydney, Australia, on board Flight No. 209 of the Philippine Airlines. The accused had two pieces of luggage with him which he passed through the x-ray machine at the departure area of the airport. The machine showed certain portions of the sidings of one bag and the bottom of the other to be dark in color, making its operator to suspect that something illegal was inside them. Upon the request of the Customs examiner in the NAIA to whom the x-ray finding was referred, accused Burton removed all his belongings from the travelling bags. The two bags of the accused were then subjected to another x-ray examination. The same finding was revealed.


The accused, together with his two pieces of baggage, was brought to the Customs Office at the NAIA, where, with his consent, the sidings of one bag and the bottom of the other were slashed open. Found inside, sandwiched between thin plastic slabs attached to the upper and lower sides of one bag, and forming the false bottom of the other, were twelve (12) rectangular bricks and one (1) square brick of dark brown materials, each with a thickness of about one-third (1/3) of an inch. Their total weight was five and six-tenths (5.6) kilos.


During his investigation, the accused was observed to be walking in an uneasy manner. Suspecting that there was something hidden in his shoes, the investigator requested Burton to remove his shoes to which the accused consented. Retrieved from inside the shoes, hidden between their soles and the upper covers, were four (4) blocks, each about one-fourth (1/4) of an inch thick, of the same dark brown substance shaped according to the contour of the soles of the shoes. The articles taken from the two bags and from the pair of shoes of the accused were suspected to be marijuana or ""hashish"" by the Customs and the police investigators. Representative samples of the substance were referred to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for examination. The NBI Forensic Chemistry Division and the PNP Crime Laboratory Service found the materials to be ""hashish"", a derivative of marijuana. This substance is a prohibited drug. (Sec. 2(e)(1)(i), Republic Act No. 6425)




Evidence for the Prosecution




The prosecution presented witnesses Felimon Napuli, Forensic Chemist Julieta Flores, SPO4 Guillermo Zuño, and Forensic Chemist Leslie Chambers.


Napuli, a customs examiner, testified that on December 26, 1992, at 9:30 p.m., he was assigned at the inspection lane of the East Pre-Departure Area, Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Upon being informed by the x-ray operator that the x-ray examination showed unidentified objects inside two pieces of appellant's luggage, he conducted a thorough examination of said luggage. After obtaining permission from appellant, Napuli slashed the side of the suitcase with a knife and discovered twelve (12) blocks and one (1) bar of a dark substance suspected to be hashish. The dimension of each block was 4 x 7 x 1/2 inches (Exh. ""T-EE""); and the bar, more or less 4 x 4 x 2/3 inches (Exh. ""FF""). The blocks and bar appeared as black items ""processed in compact."" The suspected hashish was confiscated and turned over to the duty collector, and appellant was taken to District Collector Supervisor Bautista. Napuli proceeded to the Investigation Section where he executed an affidavit (Exh. ""A"") regarding this incident.

Flores, Forensic Chemist 2 of the National Bureau of Investigation, testified that she received a letter-request from the Customs Narcotics Interdiction Unit of the Bureau of Customs for chromatographic analysis of the specimen of the confiscated substance from appellant (Exh ""B"").

 RESULTS for 
HASHISH.




SPO4 Zuño, team leader of the Philippine National Police Narcotics Command stationed at NAIA, testified that at about 9 p.m. of December 26, 1992, while he was on-duty at the East Pre-Departure Section, he was informed by SPO2 Andres Andal that two pieces of luggage, suspected to contain illegal materials, had passed through the xray-machine. He went to the x-ray machine where Napuli was conducting a thorough examination of appellant's luggage, consisting of a suitcase and a traveling bag. At first, appellant was reluctant to comply with Napuli's request to open them and to remove their contents; then, Zuño heard appellant say, ""
Patay.
"" When the two pieces of luggage were passed again through the x-ray machine, Zuño saw on the monitor a dark portion on the side of the suitcase and on the base of the traveling bag. The suitcase and bag were subjected to a thorough examination. Zuño, passing his hand along the interior frame of the suitcase, noticed that the side was thicker than that of an ordinary suitcase. Using a cutter (a bladed instrument), Napuli slashed the outer side and the lining of the suitcase. The hard plastic frame was thicker than the side of an ordinary suitcase and was wrapped with masking tape. When opened, a dark brown substance, shaped into blocks of various sizes and wrapped in masking tape, was concealed between the hard plastic frames.


The base of the traveling bag, which was made of two pieces of plastic and wood materials neatly riveted to the bottom of the traveling bag, was taken out and examined. When opened, more blocks of the same substance were found. A total of twelve blocks and one bar of the brown substance suspected to be hashish, a derivative of marijuana, were found inside appellant's luggage.


Past midnight, appellant was brought to the Customs Legal Investigation Division, where he was interrogated by customs investigators as to the source of the suspected hashish. Appellant denied having knowledge thereof.


Zuño observed appellant to be walking ""uneasily"" arousing his suspicion that a deadly weapon or an illegal item could be concealed in his legs or shoes. So he requested appellant to remove his white Reebok rubber shoes. He took pictures while appellant was removing them (Exh. ""K-M""). Customs Police Elpidio Manuel examined said shoes (Exh. ""I-J"") and found four (4) blocks of a similar substance suspected to be hashish. The blocks were either 2 x 3 x 1/4 inches or 3 x 5 x 1/4 inches in dimension, cut to conform to the shapes of the soles of the shoes (Exh. ""P-S"").


When asked to comment on this discovery, appellant replied, ""I have nothing to say."" Zuño issued a Receipt for Property Seized (Exh. ""N"") 
11
 


Chambers, forensic chemist of the PNP Crime Laboratory Services, testified that, at the request of the Chief of Office, NAIA District Office, SOD, PNP NARCOM, she conducted three types of tests: (1) the physical test, which included weighing of the samples and microscopic observation thereof, (2) the chemical test (Duquenois Levine Test), and (3) a confirmatory test (Thin Layer Chromatographic Test). The tests also gave positive results for marijuana (Exh. ""HH-LL"").




Evidence for the Defense




The defense presented appellant as its sole witness. He is a British national, unemployed and with a physical deformity (his arms are half the normal length) allegedly caused by his mother's having taken the drug Thalidomide during pregnancy.


He testified that on December 26, 1992, he went to the NAIA to check in his luggage for his flight to Sydney, Australia, to visit his uncle. Said luggage was purchased on that very same day from a certain John Parry for P10,000.00 together with a tape recorder, leather boots, and several articles of clothing. He explained that he had bought said bags to accommodate his extra belongings and to help Parry raise money for the latter's plane fare to Australia. As his luggage was passed through the x-ray machine, the operator found three unidentified dark areas on the top portion of the suitcase near the handle.


Brought before Napuli, he was asked to open his black canvass suitcase and to remove his personal belongings therefrom. He was informed that his bags could not be cleared to board the plane because of the unidentified dark portions appearing on the x-ray monitor. So, he gave Napuli permission to open the lining of the suitcase and to remove the base of the travelling bag. Blocks of a substance suspected to be hashish were found inside the lining of the suitcase. He denied having seen them before.


A medical kit, containing a syringe, was also found inside his traveling bag. Zuño asked if he was also using heroin. He replied, ""
Hindi
"". He explained that his physician in Britain advised him to bring his own syringe because, in some countries, the doctors use one syringe for two or three persons.


He claimed that he was alarmed and confused when told that he was to be investigated. He asked Andal if he was under arrest; the latter replied in the affirmative and informed him of his rights. Insults were hurled at him because of his deformity. Threats were likewise made; he was told that he could not avoid trouble because nobody knew that he was there. While escorting him to the toilet, Zuño remarked that maybe he was going to the toilet because he was hiding something.


When he returned, the police officer asked to look inside his shoes. After being threatened, appellant handed him his shoes. Zuño examined them and opened the inner soles which yielded more bars of the yet unidentified substance. Zuño returned his shoes and took his picture while he was putting them on. He was detained at the NARCOM office until noon of December 28, 1992.


He admitted that his only source of income was a trust fund in an English bank; proceeds of the loan he had obtained from it were sent to the Philippines.




Ruling of the Trial Court




The trial court convicted accused of attempting to transport prohibited drugs under Section 4, in relation to Section 21, of R.A. 6425. It ruled that the appellant 
12




. . . should be deemed to have the intention to possess the marijuana or ""hashish"" confiscated from him, in line with the principle that mere possession . . . raises the presumption of guilt and the burden of proof is on the possessor to explain the absence of 
animus possidendi.




Appellant was unable to rebut such presumption arising from his possession of the prohibited drugs. His excuse that he had no knowledge of the hashish was unavailing, as malice or intent to commit the crime is not required in cases of 
mala prohibita.




Issues




Appellant alleges that the lower court erred by: 
13




I. . . . failing to consider ""knowledge or awareness"" of the existence of prohibited drugs as an essential element of the offense charged.


II. . . . ruling that the accused failed to destroy the presumption of ""unlawful intent"".


III. . . . giving full credence to the testimony of prosecution witness, Mr. Zuno.




The main thesis of the defense is that it was not proven that appellant knew that the bags he had checked in at the airport contained a prohibited drug. Appellant further claims that the trial court misunderstood his defense to be lack of ""criminal intent"" in carrying the prohibited drug instead of ""lack of knowledge"" that he was carrying it. Appellant explains that the trial court confused malice or criminal intent, which is unimportant in 
malum prohibitum,
 and 
animus possidendi
 or intent to possess a prohibited drug, which is an element of illegal transportation of a prohibited drug.


The prosecution's evidence was allegedly overcome by appellant's testimony that he bought the luggage and shoes from a certain John Parry without knowing that they concealed hashish.


In any event he challenges the prosecution's evidence, particularly the testimony of Zuño, as unworthy of credence.




The Court's Ruling


Crime and Punishment




Section 4 of Article II of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1675, provides:




Sec. 4. 
Sale, Administration, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Prohibited Drugs.
 — The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from twenty thousand to thirty thousand pesos shall be imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, administer, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any prohibited drug, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions. . . .




As clearly indicated, said provision penalizes the acts of selling, administering, delivering, giving away to another, distributing, dispatching in transit or transporting any prohibited drug. While sale and delivery are given technical meanings under said Act, transportation, distribution and dispensation are not defined.

Sec. 21 of the same act provides:




Sec. 21. 
Attempt and Conspiracy.
 — The same penalty prescribed by this Act for the commission of the offense shall be imposed in case of any attempt or conspiracy to commit the same in the following cases:


x x x           x x x          x x x




(b) Sale, administration, delivery, distribution and transportation of dangerous drugs;




x x x           x x x          x x x




The foregoing testimony amply demonstrates that appellant committed an act punishable by said law. We agree with the following discussion of the trial court on the crime committed by appellant:




. . . To transport means ""to transfer or convey from one person or place to another."" (Webster's Third New International Dictionary). The accused came from a hotel in Parañaque, Metro Manila, where he stayed before he checked in at the NAIA and was bound for Sydney, Australia. It is therefore apparent that he wanted to bring the prohibited drug from Parañaque to Sydney. However, because he was not able to pursue his trip, he should be considered only to have attempted to transport the prohibited drug to Sydney. Under Section 21 of The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, the same penalty prescribed by the said Act for the commission of the offense of transporting dangerous drugs shall be imposed in case of any attempt to commit the same crime.


xxx xxx xxx


The act of accused Burton in attempting to transport the ""hashish"" in question clearly constitutes a violation of Section 4, in relation to Section 21, of Republic Act No. 6425, since it does not appear that the accused had any legal authority to transfer or convey the said prohibited drug from the Philippines to Australia.




Upholding the Assessment of Witness by the Trial Court




Appellant questions the trial court's conferment of faith and credence on the testimony of prosecution witness Zuño despite some apparent inconsistencies. It is a well-entrenched rule in law that the assessment of a witness' credibility by the trial court is accorded great respect because said court is in the best position to observe and evaluate the witness' demeanor and deportment at the time he gave his testimony. 
19


The questions of whether appellant did utter the word 
""patay""
 in disappointment over the discovery of his misdeed and whether Zuño took pictures of appellant while the latter was removing or putting on his rubber shoes are of little significance. The trial court did take the utterance allegedly heard by Zuño as proof of appellant's knowledge of the hashish in his luggage and shoes, but the ineludible fact remains that appellant was caught with twelve blocks and seven bars of hashish in his possession. This remains unrebutted as proof of appellant's guilt.


The trial court properly admitted in evidence Exhibits ""P-S"" despite the absence of Zuño's markings because these blocks of hashish bore Customs Examiner Elizabeth Ayonon's markings instead. Zuño witnessed Ayonon place her markings on said exhibits. 
20


Existence of Animus Possidendi Unrebutted




In criminal cases involving prohibited drugs, appellant argues that there can be no conviction unless the prosecution shows that the accused knowingly possessed the prohibited articles in his person, or more legally put, that 
animus possidendi
 is shown to be present together with his possession or control of such article. 
21


Under the Rules of Evidence (Sec. 3[j], Rule 131, Rules of Court), ""things which a person possesses, or exercises acts of ownership over, are owned by him."" Such disputable presumption is based upon the principle that direct proof of facts of this nature is rarely available, except in cases of confession. In several cases, the Court has held that possession of a considerable quantity of marijuana cannot indicate anything except the intention of the accused to sell, distribute and deliver said prohibited drug. 
22


Knowledge refers to a mental state of awareness of a fact. Since courts cannot penetrate the mind of an accused and thereafter state its perceptions with certainty, resort to other evidence is necessary. 
Animus possidendi,
 as a state of mind, may be determined on a case-to-case basis by taking into consideration the prior or contemporaneous acts of the accused, as well as the surrounding circumstances. Its existence may and usually must be inferred from the attendant events in each particular case. 
23


In prosecutions involving prohibited drugs, the state has a right to specify what proofs shall constitute
 prima facie
 evidence of guilt, and thereafter to place upon the accused the burden of showing that his act or acts are innocent and are not committed with any criminal intent or intention. 
24


The existence of 
animus possidendi
 is only
 prima facie.
 Thus, it is subject to contrary proof and may be rebutted by evidence that the accused did not in fact exercise power and control over the thing in question, and did not intend to do

so. 
25
 




The burden of evidence is thus shifted to the possessor to explain absence of 
animus possidendi.
 A mere uncorroborated claim of the accused that he did not know that he had a prohibited drug in his possession is insufficient. Any evasion, false statement, or attempt at concealment on his part, in explaining how the drug came into his possession, may be considered in determining his guilt. 
27


Under the facts obtaining in this case, the 5.6 kilos of hashish cleverly and painstakingly concealed inside appellant's luggage and rubber shoes can be said to be in the possession and control of appellant with his knowledge. Not only were the blocks and bars of the prohibited drug of a considerable amount, but they were placed inside three different objects in order to escape detection by the authorities.


The Court also finds incredible appellant's allegation that he had no idea that the luggage and rubber shoes he ""purchased"" from a certain John Parry contained prohibited drugs. Even the alleged transaction between them is dubious. Appellant claims that he had paid Parry P10,000.00 for the two pieces of luggage, clothes, camera, tape recorder, and Reebok rubber shoes which Parry would redeem from appellant in Australia. Appellant explains that this transaction, which brought no benefit or advantage to him, was more of a loan, an act of charity, to Parry who was raising money for his plane fare. However, appellant also admits that Parry was only a casual acquaintance whom he had met for about five to six times only. Thus, it is unbelievable for anyone, much less appellant who was unemployed and was relying only on the P6,000.00-per-month trust fund proceeds, to be so generous as to shell out such an amount to a mere acquaintance.


Furthermore, this ""purchase"" was suspiciously made only hours prior to appellant's apprehension at the airport.
ℒαwρhi৷
 Appellant's explanation, as a whole, is undeserving of credence as it is contrary to common experience. It leaves us with no other conclusion than that the 
animus possidendi
 did in fact exist at the time of the arrest.


In 
People vs. Alfonso,
 the Court disregarded a similar excuse, saying that if it were true that the accused was not really the owner and that he simply accepted the errand from one who was not even a friend, the explanation, standing by itself, is too trite and hackneyed to be accepted at its face value, since it is obviously contrary to human experience. 
28
 


All told, the possession of the prohibited drugs by appellant with
 prima facie
 evidence of his knowledge thereof is sufficient to sustain a conviction in the absence of a satisfactory explanation.

The Proper Penalty




The trial court imposed the penalty of ""life imprisonment"" plus a fine of twenty thousand pesos as the crime was committed on December 26, 1992 or about a year before Republic Act No. 7659, 
30
 






First,
 the wealth of jurisprudence in cases wherein ""life imprisonment""' is imposed is to the effect that said penalty, unlike 
reclusion perpetua,
 does not carry accessory penalties. In the event that Republic Act No. 7659 is applied retrospectively to appellant, he has to suffer not only 
reclusion perpetua
 but also the accessory penalties.


Second,
 the fine imposed upon appellant is the minimum imposable of twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00), whereas if he were penalized under the new law, he would have to bear the minimum fine of P500,000.00. Thus, retrospective application of Republic Act No. 7659, the ""heinous crimes law,"" in cases wherein the penalty of ""life imprisonment"" has been imposed by the trial court, would prove more burdensome upon the appellant and would contradict the basic principle that all penal laws shall be interpreted in favor of the accused.




In line with current jurisdiction, we affirm the trial court's imposition of the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of twenty thousand pesos (P20,000. 00) upon appellant.
