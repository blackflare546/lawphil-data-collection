G.R. No. 119696 August 18, 1997


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, 
plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


RAZUL GUIAMIL y ANGKAT and ABEDIN MAGUID y KONTIER, 
accused-appellants.




BELLOSILLO, 
J.:


RASUL GUIAMIL y ANGKAT and ABEDIN MAGUID y KONTIER were convicted of robbery with homicide by the Regional Trial Court of Manila and sentenced of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay the heirs of their victim P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and another P50,000.00 for funeral expenses, plus costs:
1


On 31 May 1993, at about one-fifteen in the afternoon, appellants together with an unidentified person went in front of Lucky Jewelry Store located at 1043 Ongpin Street, Sta. Cruz, Manila. Appellant Abedin Maguid suddenly smashed the glass display window of the store and together with his companions took several rolls of jewelry worth P1,200,000. When Claude Masupil, one of the employees of the store, stood up to pursue the intruders, Maguid shot him to death.


The store employees immediately radioed for police assistance. SPO3 Benjamin Gonzales, SPO3 Wilfredo Salinel, SPO1 Eduardo Reyes, SPO1 Sorel and SPO3 Caoc responded. As the policemen approached, Arturo Mayo, employee of the store, met SPO3 Salinel and pointed to him the direction where the robbers went some 10 meters away. SPO3 Salinel told the culprits to stop but they started to run away instead, so the lawmen gave chase. Maguid fired at SPO3 Salinel. The latter fired back hitting Maguid at the right portion of his back and the right side of his face. When Maguid fell, one of his companions grabbed his gun and ran away. SPO3 Salinel got hold of Maguid, searched him and found a plastic bag containing jewelry. SPO1 Reyes, on his part, apprehended appellant Razul Guiamil at Rizal Avenue.


Dr. Manuel G. Lagonera conducted an autopsy on the body of Claude Masupil and certified that the cause of his death was ""hypovolemic shock secondary to a gunshot wound, left antero lateral thorax.""

Appellants contend that the lower court erred (a) in not acquitting them on reasonable doubt as the physical evidence tended to show that the prosecution witnesses lied and in fact made it appear that accused Abedin Maguid was frontally shot after he allegedly exchanged shots with the police; (b) in falling to note that the testimonies of the two policemen were contrary to human experience and that their statements were replete with inconsistencies seriously affecting the validity of their testimonies; (c) in failing to observe that there was no proper identification or that their identification was clearly doubtful, inconclusive, with badges of fabrication; and, (d) in failing to consider the explanation of both accused that they were falsely implicated because the policemen feared they would be charged for having shot Abedin Maguid although accidentally.
3


The appellants claim that the evidence of the prosecution suffered from serious inconsistencies, e.g., (a) the testimony of SPO3 Salinel that appellant Maguid was facing him when he fired at the latter hitting him at his left eye,
4
 is contrary to medical findings that the bullet entered through his right ear and exited at his left eye; (b) the statement of SPO3 Benjamin Gonzales that he and the policemen chased the robbers up to Rizal Avenue near Roan where they found appellant Rasul Guiamil slumped on the ground near another police officer, is contradicted by SPO2 Reyes in his statement that the police caught appellant Guiamil at the corner of Ronquillo in front of Uniwide at Rizal Avenue; (c) the policemen testified that a plastic bag of jewelry was recovered from Maguid at the time he was apprehended but no jewelry were presented in court by the prosecution; (d) the testimony of Arturo Mayo that he, together with the policemen, chased the robbers after which appellant Guiamil was shot by one of the policemen, is contradicted by the evidence that it was appellant Abedin Maguid and not Guiamil who was shot.


Appellants also argue that they were not properly identified by prosecution witnesses Galileo Mayo and Arturo Mayo as the robbers, and the latter was not even listed as one of the witnesses in the information. The crucial issue then depends on the correctness of the factual findings of the court 
a quo.
 The rule is settled that in the absence of any fact or circumstance of weight and influence which has been overlooked or the significance of which has been misconstrued as to impeach the findings of the trial court, the appellate courts will not interfere with trial court's findings on the credibility of witnesses or set aside its judgment considering that it is in a better position to decide the question having heard the witnesses themselves during the trial.


The matter of assigning values to declarations at the witness stand is best and most completely performed or carried out by a trial judge who, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimonies in the light of defendant's behavior, demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial, and the conclusions of trial courts command great weight and respect. In weighing contradictory declarations and statements, greater weight must generally be given to the positive testimony of the prosecution witnesses than to the denials of the defendant.

A careful review of the records will show that the witnesses for the prosecution positively identified the appellants as the persons who robbed Lucky Jewelry Store and on the occasion thereof appellant Maguid shot to death Claude Masupil, an employee of the store. The testimonies of these prosecution witnesses, especially Arturo Mayo, SPO3 Wilfredo Salinel and Galileo Mayo, were found by the trial court to be clear and credible. Hereunder is the testimony of Arturo Mayo —

Aside from Arturo Mayo, his brother Galileo Mayo who was the manager of Lucky Jewelry Store, also positively identified the appellants as the culprits who robbed the store —

In robbery with homicide cases, the prosecution need only to prove these elements: (a) the taking of personal property with violence or intimidation against persons or with force upon things; (b) the property taken belongs to another; (c) the taking be done with 
animo lucrandi
; and, (d) on the occasion of the robbery or by reason thereof homicide in its generic sense was committed.
9


The evidence for the prosecution indubitably shows that after appellants broke the glass window of Lucky Jewelry Store, they took with them several pieces of jewelry. Immediately after the robbery, appellant Abedin Maguid shot the deceased Claude Masupil. The crime was witnessed by Galileo Mayo and Arturo Mayo who positively identified appellants as the persons who robbed their store and killed Masupil.


The alleged inconsistencies of the prosecution witnesses refer only to minor details and not upon the basic aspects of the crime itself and therefore do not detract from the credibility of the witnesses. 
10
 A witness is not expected to remember an incident with perfect recollection down to the insignificant and littlest details. The most honest witness may make mistakes sometimes but such honest lapses do not necessarily impair his credibility or destroy the essential integrity of the prosecution evidence as a whole. 
11


The argument of appellants that they were framed up by the police officers to cover up the latter's negligence for shooting Abedin Maguid is bereft of merit. There is no evidence that appellants filed a complaint or action for the alleged actuations of the policemen. When police officers have no motive for testifying falsely against the accused, courts are inclined to uphold the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties.
ℒαwρhi৷
 Moreover, the testimonies of the police officers jibe with those of the eyewitnesses on material points. When there is no showing that the principal witnesses for the prosecution were moved by improper motives, the presumption is that they were not so moved and their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credit. 
12


Appellants rely heavily on denial to prove their innocence. Denial like alibi is inherently a weak defense and cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution witnesses that the accused committed the crime. 
13
 In the instant case, the denial by appellants was unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence. The testimonies of appellants on their own version of the incident are negative and self-serving evidence which deserve no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary value over the testimonies of credible eyewitnesses on affirmative matters. 
14


Finally, appellants cannot fault the trial court for allowing the testimony in court of Galileo Mayo although he was not previously listed as one of the witnesses to be presented by the prosecution. The matter as to what evidence to present or who to present as witness is within the discretionary power of the prosecution and definitely not for the courts to dictate. 
15


The trial court was correct in finding both appellants guilty of robbery with homicide although it was only appellant Abedin Maguid who actually shot and killed the victim. The rule is settled that whenever homicide has been committed as a consequence or on the occasion of robbery, all those who took part as principals in the robbery will also be held guilty as principals of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide although they did not actually take part in the homicide. 
16
 The penalty for robbery with homicide under Art. 294, par. 1, of the Revised Penal Code is 
reclusion perpetua 
to death. But in the absence of aggravating circumstances, the lesser penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 should be imposed.


WHEREFORE,
 the Decision appealed from convicting accused-appellants 
RAZUL GUIAMIL y ANGKAT
 and 
ABEDIN MAGUID y KONTIER
 of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide and sentencing each of them to 
reclusion perpetua
 is 
AFFIRMED
. Accused-appellants are further ordered to pay the heirs Claude Masupil P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 for funeral expenses. Costs against accused-appellants.


SO ORDERED
.


Padilla, Vitug, Kapunan and Hermosisima, Jr., JJ., concur.
