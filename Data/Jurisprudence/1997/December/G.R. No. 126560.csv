vs.


THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION and DIRECTOR BARTOLOME C. AMOGUIS, 
respondents.




R E S O L U T I O N


 




DAVIDE, JR., 
J.:


Petitioner urges us to set aside, on ground of grave abuse of discretion, the resolution of respondent Court of Appeals of 30 April 1996 in CA-G.R. SP No. 40341 denying petitioner's ""Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court,"" and its resolution of 19 September 1996 denying the motion for reconsideration.


Petitioner was the Administrative Officer of Regional Office No. XI of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). In an Order dated 4 September 1992, then DOLE Secretary Ma. Nieves R. Confesor ordered petitioner ""DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits and disqualification for (
sic
) re-employment in the government service,"" for conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service, frequent absences from duty during office hours, and violation of reasonable office rules and regulations. Unsuccessful in his bid for reconsideration, petitioner appealed to the Civil Service Commission.


In its Resolution No. 95-0230 of 12 January 1995,
1
 the Civil Service Commission ""found [petitioner] guilty of being Notoriously Undesirable"" and imposed upon him ""the penalty of dismissal from the service with all its accessories."" Petitioner moved for reconsideration, which, however, was denied by the Civil Service Commission in its Resolution No. 960987 of 13 February 1996.
2


On 12 April 1996, petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a 
Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Certiorari Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court,
3
 
 docketed by the Court of Appeals as CA-G.R. SP No. 40341. He alleged that he received a copy of the 13 February 1996 Civil Service Commission resolution on 29 March 1996 and he had then ""until 13 April 1996 within which to file a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as amended;"" and that he needed three (3) weeks to secure ""certified true copies of the resolutions and other pertinent documents [from] the Civil Service Commission, Quezon City,"" which were to be attached to the petition. He thus asked for an extension of 30 days from 13 April 1996 within which to file the petition.


On 30 April 1996, the Court of Appeals promulgated a Resolution
4
 
 denying petitioner's aforementioned Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition, decreeing:




The instant ""Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for 
Certiorari 
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court"" filed on 12 April 1996 is hereby DENIED it being the wrong mode of appeal.


It is to be noted that the questioned resolution was rendered by the Civil Service Commission; that the Supreme Court Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 (Revised Circular No. 1-91) specifically provides that appeals from judgments or final orders or resolutions of the
 quasi-judicial
 agencies (which includes the Civil Service Commission) is Petition for Review. (Pars. 1 and 5, 
supra.
)




Since the Court of Appeals denied his motion for reconsideration on 19 September 1996,
5
 petitioner filed the instant petition, designating it in both the caption and the body as one for ""
certiorari
"" under Rule 65 or Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as amended."" Petitioner alleges:




I THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO MYOPIC OR SHORT SIGHTEDNESS IN JUDGMENT IN ADHERING AND LIMITING ITSELF ONLY TO APPEAL BY A PETITION FOR REVIEW UNDER SUPREME COURT REVISED ADMINISTRATIVE CIRCULAR NO. 1-95 (REVISED CIRCULAR NO. 1-91) GROSSLY IGNORING THAT AUTHORITY/POWER TO ISSUE WRITS OF 
MANDAMUS,
 PROHIBITION, 
CERTIORARI, HABEAS CORPUS
 AND 
QUO WARRANTO 
AND AUXILIARY WRITS OR PROCESSES, WHETHER OR NOT IN AID OF ITS APPELLATE JURISDICTION AS GRANTED UNDER PAR. (1), SEC. 9 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7902 IN CASES WHERE THE 
QUASI-JUDICIAL
 BODY COMMITS ULTRAVIREZ [
sic
] ACTS TANTAMOUNT TO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION OR LACK/IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION AS IN THE INSTANT CASE WHERE THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION FOR THE FIRST TIME ON APPEAL CONSIDERED DOCUMENTS/ EVIDENCE WHICH WERE NEVER INTRODUCED/ PRESENTED NOR ADMITTED DURING THE FORMAL HEARING OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CASE.


II A QUESTION OF LAW AS TO WHETHER DECISIONS OR RESOLUTIONS OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION ISSUED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION CAN NO LONGER BE REVIEWED BY THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS BY A PETITION FOR REVIEW UNDER RULE 45 OF 65 OF THE NEW RULES OF COURT AS AMENDED DESPITE THE PATENT GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION ON THE PART OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION IN DECIDING A CASE BASED ON DOCUMENTS/EVIDENCE INTRODUCED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON APPEAL, ORDINARY APPEAL BOT [
sic
] BEING THE PLAIN, SPEEDY AND ADEQUATE REMEDY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LAW.


III A QUESTION OF LAW AS TO WHETHER A PETITION FOR 
CERTIORARI 
UNDER
 
RULE 45 OR 65 OF THE RULES OF COURT AS AMENDED CAN BE CONSIDERED A MODE OF APPEAL AND IF SO CONSIDERED AS A MODE OF APPEAL WHETHER IT IS THE PROPER REMEDY TO CORRECT SUPER [
sic
] GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION IN DECIDING A CASE BASED ON AN [
sic
] EVIDENCE NOT INTRODUCED DURING THE FORMAL HEARING OF THE CASE IT APPEARING UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE THERE IS NO APPEAL, NOR ANY PLAIN, SPEEDY, AND ADEQUATE REMEDY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LAW THAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PETITIONER EXCEPT THE SAID PETITION FOR 
CERTIORARI 
RULE 45 OR 65 OF THE RULED OF COURT AS AMENDED.




In its Comment,
6
 the Office of the Solicitor General submits that the Court of Appeals did not commit grave abuse of discretion as the petition which petitioner actually filed with the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 40341 on 10 May 1996 was one for 
certiorari 
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, as clearly shown by the grounds petitioner relied upon, to wit:

The Solicitor General then concluded that since under Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 of this Court appeals from judgments of
 quasi-judicial
 agencies such as the Civil Service Commission should be by verified
 petition for review,
 and considering further that Circular No. 2-90 of this Court provides that appeals taken to either this Court or the Court of Appeals by the wrong or inappropriate mode of appeal shall be dismissed, then petitioner's motion for extension of time to file petition for 
certiorari
 was correctly denied by the Court of Appeals.




In its Comment
8
 filed by its Office for Legal Affairs, respondent Civil Service Commission claims as misplaced petitioner's reliance on Section 9(1) of B.P. Blg. 129 which vests upon the Court of Appeals exclusive original jurisdiction to issue writs of 
mandamus,
 prohibition, 
certiorari, habeas corpus,
 and 
quo warranto,
 whether or not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. Respondent Commission contends that the only mode of appeal from its decisions is a petition for review, in accordance with Revised Circular No. 1-95 of this Court and Section 9(3) of B.P. Bldg. 129, as amended by R.A. No. 7902. The latter provides:




Sec. 9. 
Jurisdiction.
 — The Court of Appeals shall exercise:


x x x           x x x          x x x




(3) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and
 quasi-judicial 
agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commissions, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Social Security Commission, the Employees Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines under the Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.

In his Consolidated Reply,
9
 petitioner justified his filing a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court in light of the ""super-grave abuse of discretion on the part of the . . . Civil Service Commission"" in issuing the challenged resolution, and that an ordinary appeal was ""not appropriate and sufficient to seek reddress [
sic
] . . . for the reason that it would in effect impliedly give credence to the unlawful acts of the Civil Service Commission thus admitting its despotic, arrogant exercise of authority . . .""


We rule against petitioner.


The Court of Appeals committed no error in denying petitioner's ""Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.""


Prior to the effectivity of R.A. 7902, a party aggrieved by any decision, final order or resolution of the Civil Service Commission had only one remedy, namely, a special civil action for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of

Court 
10
 to be filed with this Court pursuant to Section 7 of Article IX-A of the Constitution, which reads, in part:




Sec. 7. . . . Unless otherwise provided by law this Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on 
certiorari
 by the aggrieved party within thirty days from receipt of a copy thereof.




Conformably with its implied authority in this Section, Congress passed R.A. No. 7902 vesting upon the Court of Appeals appellate jurisdiction over cases decided or resolved by the Civil Service Commission, but not the other two Constitutional Commissions treated under Article IX. Pursuant to Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, the mode of appeal from a decision of the Civil Service Commission, to bring it within the 
appellate jurisdiction
 of the Court of Appeals, is a
 petition for review
 to be filed within the period therein fixed. This petition for review is the same as that contemplated in Section 29 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 (R.A. No. 269), as amended, and in Circular No. 2-90, but not that treated in Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which refers to petitions filed in the Supreme Court for the review of decisions or final orders of the Court of Appeals.


Under the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, which took effect on 1 July 1997, a petition for review as a mode of appeal to the Court of Appeals from decisions, final orders or resolutions of the Court of Tax Appeals and 
quasi-judicial
 bodies, including the Civil Service Commission, is governed by Rule 43 thereof.


Considering that petitioner announced in his motion for extension of time that he would be filing a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the Court of Appeals cannot be faulted for peremptorily denying the motion.


Petitioner claims, however, that a petition for review was not his exclusive remedy, as he could also avail of a special civil action for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65. There are, of course, settled distinctions between a petition for review as a mode of appeal and a special civil action for 
certiorari,
 thus:




a. In appeal by 
certiorari,
 the petition is based on questions of law which the appellant desires the appellate court to resolve. In 
certiorari
 as an original action, the petition raises the issue as to whether the lower court acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.


b. 
Certiorari,
 as a mode of appeal, involves the review of the judgment, award or final order on the merits. The original action for 
certiorari 
may be directed against an interlocutory order of the court prior to appeal from the judgment or where there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy or adequate remedy.


c. Appeal by 
certiorari
 must be made within the reglementary period for appeal. An original action for 
certiorari
 may be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution sought to be assailed.


d. Appeal by 
certiorari
 stays the judgment, award or order appealed from. An original action for 
certiorari,
 unless a writ of preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order shall have been issued, does not stay the challenged proceeding.


e. In appeal by 
certiorari,
 the petitioner and respondent are the original parties to the action, and the lower court or 
quasi-judicial
 agency is not to be impleaded. In 
certiorari
 as an original action, the parties are the aggrieved, party against the lower court 
quasi-judicial
 agency and the prevailing parties, who thereby respectively become the petitioner and respondents.


f. In 
certiorari
 for purposes of appeal, the prior filing of a motion for reconsideration is not required (Sec. 1, Rule 45); while in 
certiorari
 as an original action, a motion for reconsideration is a condition precedent (Villa-Rey Transit vs. Bello, L-18957, April 23, 1963), subject to certain exceptions.


g. In appeal by 
certiorari,
 the appellate court is in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction and power of review for, while in 
certiorari
 as an original action, the higher court exercises original jurisdiction under its power of control and supervision over the proceedings of lower courts.
11




The original jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over special civil actions for, 
inter alia, certiorari,
 is vested upon it in Section 9(1) of B.P. Blg. 129. This jurisdiction is concurrent with the Supreme Court
12
 and the Regional Trial Court.
13


If, indeed, petitioner initially believed that he had the alternative remedy of a special civil action for 
certiorari
 which would have been more effective and adequate, then it was not necessary for him to ask for an extension of time to file the petition. Under Rule 65 then, he had a 
reasonable period
 from receipt of a copy of the Civil Service Commission resolution denying his motion for reconsideration within which to file the petition.
ℒαwρhi৷
 That 
reasonable period 
has been interpreted to be ninety (90) days.
14
 We are not, however, persuaded that petitioner initially thought of filing a special civil action. All along, what he had in mind was a petition for review, as evidenced by his express reference in his motion to a petition for review under Rule 45 and his indication of the date he received a copy of the resolution, 
viz.
, 29 March 1996, and the last day to file the petition, 
viz.
, 13 April 1996, which coincided with the last day prescribed under Rule 45.


If petitioner then filed a special civil action for 
certiorari
 on 10 May 1996, it was only because he had lost his right to appeal by way of the intended petition fore review. The proffered justification then for his belated filing of a special action for 
certiorari
 was nothing but a crude attempt to circumvent standing rules of procedure, which we cannot tolerate.


It is settled that a special civil action for 
certiorari
 will not lie as a substitute for the lost remedy of appeal,
15
 and we find no special nor compelling reasons why we should make out an exception here.


In any case, even if we were to sympathize with petitioner and permit his recourse under Rule 65, the end result would remain unchanged since a perusal of the challenged resolutions of the Civil Service Commission fails to disclose any grave abuse of discretion on its part.


WHEREFORE,
 the instant petition is 
DISMISSED
