In a letter, dated 03 March 1997, Judge Ananson E. Jayme sought a reconsideration of the Court's resolution of 28 January 1997, detailing him as Acting Presiding Judge of the Sibulan MTC, in view of the designation, on 22 January 1997, by Executive Judge Eleuterio E. Chiu of Judge Fe Lualhati D. Bustamante 
4
 as Acting Presiding Judge of MTC, Sibulan, per Administrative Order No. 2-97.


In its resolution, dated 01 July 1997, the Court resolved to refer the matter to the Office of the Court Administrator (""OCA"") for evaluation, report and recommendation.
ℒαwρhi৷


In a memorandum addressed to Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa, the OCA, through DCA Bernardo P. Abesamis, reported that three cases were left undecided by Judge Arnaiz, i.e., Criminal Case No. 2276, Criminal Case No. 2491 and Civil Case No. 336. It recommended that —




. . . (a) a fine of One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) be imposed on Judge Antonio Arnaiz for his failure to decide and/or resolve Crim. Case Nos. 2,276, 2,491 and Civil Case No. 336 and to order the release of the balance of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) withheld from his retirement benefits per Resolution dated January 28, 1977; [and] (b) The Resolution of January 28, 1997 designating Judge Ananson Jayme as Acting Presiding Judge of MTC, Sibulan, Negros Oriental, be set aside and Judge Fe P. Bustamante, MTC of Siaton, be designated instead as Acting Presiding Judge of MTC, Sibulan, Negros Oriental.




The Court agrees with, and adopts the recommendation of, the OCA..


A judge should be conscious of his duty to resolve cases before him with good dispatch. Any delay and inaction in the disposition of cases can easily cause great injustice. Procrastination can also invite suspicion of ulterior motives on the part of the judge. When circumstances arise that would render him incapable to decide within the prescribed time a pending litigation submitted for decision or resolution, all that a judge has to do is to request from the Court and justify an extension of time within which to resolve the case. The Court, cognizant of the caseload of judges and mindful of the difficulty encountered by them in the seasonable disposition of cases, would almost always grant the request.


In this instance, not only was Judge Arnaiz evidently indifferent about the exigency of coming out timely with his decisions but he also even failed to submit a simple request for extension of time from the Court within which to resolve the cases before him. His compulsory retirement compounded the problem.


In its resolution, promulgated on 28 July 1997, in A.M. No. 95-6-55-MTC and A.M. P-96-1173 (Re: Report on Audit and Physical Inventory of the Records of Cases in the Municipal Trial Court of Peñaranda Nueva Ecija) the Court has said:




The Court has consistently impressed upon members of the judiciary the need to decide cases promptly and expeditiously under the time-honored precept that justice delayed is justice denied (Re: Judge Luis B. Bello, Jr., 247 SCRA 519 [1995]). Every judge should decide cases with dispatch (Castro vs. Malazo, 99 SCRA 164 [1980]) and should be careful, punctual, and observant in the performance of his functions (Secretary of Justice vs. Bidin, 41 SCRA 742 [1971]; Escabillas vs. Martinet, 78 SCRA 367 [1977]). Failure to decide a case within the reglementary period is not excusable and constitutes gross inefficiency warranting the imposition of administrative sanction on the defaulting judge (Celino vs. Abrogar, 245 SCRA 304 [1995]; Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Court Branches 61, 134 and 147, Makati, Metro Manila, 248 SCRA [1995]).




The Court reiterates the foregoing exhortation to judges in the proper disposition of cases before them.


WHEREFORE,
 for his failure to act seasonably in Criminal Case No. 2276, Criminal Case No. 2491 and Civil Case No. 336, Judge Antonio Arnaiz is imposed a 
FINE
 of One Thousand pesos (P1,000.00), the same to be taken from the amount the Court has withheld from his retirement benefits. Concomitantly, the Court now orders the release of the balance of Five Thousand pesos (P5,000.00) withheld in the Court's resolution of 28 January 1997.


The resolution of 28 January 1997 designating Judge Ananson E. Jayme as Acting Presiding Judge of MTC, Sibulan, Negros Oriental, is 
SET ASIDE
 and Judge Fe D. Bustamante is DESIGNATED Acting Presiding Judge of MTC, Sibulan, Negros Oriental.


SO ORDERED
.


Narvasa, C.J., Regalado, Davide, Jr., Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Kapunan, Francisco, Panganiban and Martinez, JJ., concur.


Mendoza, J., is on leave.
