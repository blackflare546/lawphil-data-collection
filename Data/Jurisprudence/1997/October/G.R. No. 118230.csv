HERMOSISIMA, JR., 
J.:


On May 31, 1952, private respondents Victoriano and Agustin Bingcoy filed a Complaint for Recovery of Property in the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Negros Oriental. Docketed as Civil Case No. 2728 and raffled to Branch 37, the complaint alleged that petitioners, some time in July, 1948, attacked private respondents at their residence in Barrio Bongbong, Municipality of Valencia, Province of Negros Oriental, shot at their hogs and chickens and seriously threatened to shoot private respondents if they did not leave their house and their lands. Fearing for their lives, private respondents instinctively jumped out of their house and ran away. Thereupon, petitioners usurped private respondents' house and lands, occupied the same to the deprivation of private respondents and refused, after repeated requests and demands, to vacate the same and restore private respondents in the possession of their properties.


In their complaint before the court 
a quo,
 private respondents detailed their claims in this manner:




FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

II. That Juan Cumayao died intestate many years ago, without any payable obligation, leaving three legitimate children, namely, Victoriano, Agustin, and Prudencio, all surnamed Bingcoy, as his heirs. He also left three parcels of land in the municipality of Valencia, province of Negros Oriental, more particularly described as follows:


1. Bounded on the North by Potenciana Tavandera — 32.00 m; on the East by Narciso Lumhod — 30.00 m; on the South by Pangas — 28.00 m; and on the West by Valentin Igsi — 40.00 m; declared in the name of Juan Cumayao under Tax Declaration No. 2621, assessed at P20.00 for taxation.


2. Bounded on the North by Juan Cumayao (now Victoriano Bingcoy) — 59.00; on the East by Agapito Morano — 33.00 m; on the South by Gaspar Lumhod — 59.00 m; on the West by Bartolome Dagooc — 33.00 m; declared in the name of Agustin Bingcoy under Tax 3840, assessed at P60.00 for taxation.

Declared in the name of Juan Cumayao under Tax Decl. No. 8635, assessed at P30.00 for taxation.


III.

V. That on or about the middle of July 1948, the [petitioners], taking advantage of the weakness and ignorance of the plaintiffs who are illiterates, confederating together and helping one another, armed with a ride and bolos, went to the house of the [private respondents] at Bongbong, Valencia, and demanded from them the surrender of the above-described parcels of land, claiming that the plaintiffs are without any right to inherit from Juan Cumayao and Prudencio Bingcoy and that they, the [petitioners] are the true heirs of said deceased; and in order to scare the [private respondents] the [petitioners] shot the hogs and chickens under the house of the former and threatened to shoot them if they refused to vacate the said land.


VI. That being ignorant, harmless and incapable of protecting themselves, the [private respondents] ran away and thus the [petitioners] got into the possession and control of the above-described land, and since then have retained possession thereof to the exclusion of the [private respondents], and refused to surrender the same despite repeated amicable request made upon them by the [private respondents] in order to avoid judicial litigation.

Petitioners countered private respondents' allegations by presenting a true copy of the Death Certificate of Juan Cumayao which indicated that the latter had died single on July 17, 1926 at the age of fifty (50) years. They thus established the defense that, since Juan Cumayao died single and without any known children, he could not have passed on, by inheritance, the subject properties to private respondents. To establish their claim of ownership on the subject properties, petitioners claim that the same originally belonged to spouses Marcos Cumayao and Francisca Morales, parents of Juan Cumayao and grandparents of petitioners. They aver, thus, in their Answer dated August 30, 1952 that:




. . . upon the death of their grandparents and their aforesaid uncle, the [petitioners], together with their other cousins, nephews and nieces, succeeded to all the properties in question as the only heirs of the deceased and to the exclusion of [private respondents] herein, since Juan Cumayao died single, and have, since 1927, been in the actual, open, public, peaceful and continuous possession and enjoyment of same properties, under a claim of ownership exclusive of any other right and adverse to the whole world.

43
 in favor of private respondents. Finding sufficient evidence on record proving that ownership over the subject parcels of land was vested in private respondents as prior possessors in good faith in the concept of owner and as illegitimate heirs of Juan Cumayao, the trial court ordered the following in the dispositive portion of its decision:

Costs against the defendants.
44




Unable to agree with the decision of the trial court, petitioners appealed therefrom to the Court of Appeals. They raised the following issues:




1. What is the status of plaintiffs-appellees? Are they legitimate, or illegitimate, children of Juan Cumayao and Claudia Bingcoy?


2. If illegitimate, to what class do they belong? Are they natural children proper, or spurious children of Juan Cumayao and Claudia Bingcoy?


3. If plaintiffs-appellees are the natural children of Juan Cumayao, are they as such acknowledged natural children?


4. Are unrecognized natural children entitled to successional rights both under the Old, and in the New, Civil Code?


5. Is it correct for the trial court to consider documentary exhibits which are not formally offered in evidence?
45




and insisted that the trial court erred:




1. In declaring that plaintiffs-appellees are the illegitimate children of Juan Cumayao and Claudia Bingcoy;


2. Assuming arguendo that plaintiffs-appellees are illegitimate children of Juan Cumayao and Claudia Bingcoy, in granting successional rights to plaintiffs-appellees;


3. In considering documentary exhibits which are not formally offered in evidence as evidence;


4. In concluding that appellants failed to rebut appellees' allegation of use of force and intimidation in July, 1948 to oust appellees from the lands in question; and,


5. In not dismissing the complaint and adjudicating the properties in question to appellants.
46




On June 10, 1994, the respondent Court of Appeals rendered its Decision affirming the ownership of private respondents over the parcels of land subject of the first and second causes of action in their Complaint before the trial court, while basing such affirmance not on private respondents' right as heirs of Juan Cumayao but on their right as prior possessors in good faith under the law on acquisitive prescription.


The respondent appellate court, however, reversed the court 
a quo
 respecting the parcel of land subject of the third cause of action. The same was adjudged the property of petitioners as surviving heirs of Juan Cumayao.


The disquisition of respondent Court of Appeals on its own findings in answer to the issues raised on appeal by the petitioners and in refutation of the assigned errors in petitioners' Brief on appeal, is as follows:




. . . [A]fter a painstaking examination of the evidence presented by the parties, We find:


As to the 1st and 2nd assigned errors — The first question is: Did the trial court commit a reversible error in ruling that appellees are illegitimate children of Juan Cumayao?


The presumption that a child was born is legitimate as provided for in Article 220 of the New Civil Code is overcome by the death certificate issued by the OIC Local Civil Registrar of the Municipality of Valencia, Province of Negros Oriental where it appears that Juan Cumayao died single on July 17, 1926 . . . . It is a well-settled rule that a death certificate, if duly registered with the Civil Registrar, is considered a public document and the entries found therein are presumed correct (Stronghold Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, May 29, 1989; 173 SCRA 620); Said presumption is merely disputable and will have to yield to more positive evidence establishing their inaccuracy . . . .


Appellee's evidence on this matter is neither positive nor convincing. Aside from the testimony of appellee Victoriano Bingcoy, they presented a witness by the name of Pedro Milan who was 76 years old at the time he testified. He averred on the witness stand that he knew Juan Cumayao and Claudia Bingcoy to be the parents of herein appellees . . .; that he knew appellees since they were born as he was their neighbor at Bongkong, Valencia . . . While it has been established that Juan Cumayao beget herein appellees, the fact that he died single proves that he had children without having been married. In the absence of clear evidence to show that appellees' parents were married the conclusion is inevitable that appellees were born out of wedlock.


Appellees' explanation . . . that it was their grandmother who opted for them to use the surname Bingcoy . . . is totally incongruent with public customs and morals and human experience. No natural mother and for matter, a grandmother, under Filipino tradition, would allow a child not to use the surname of his father if he were really legitimate, considering the stigma that would necessarily attach to a child who is not allowed to use the surname of his own father. . . .


There are no other evidence to sustain appellants' claim that their parents were in fact married to controvert the statement in the death certificate that Juan Cumayao died single. Appellees have not established by sufficient evidence the fact of marriage between their parents. Neither is there any evidence showing that both parents of appellees have no legal impediment to marry.


Thus . . . [w]e agree with the ruling of the trial court that appellees are illegitimate children of Juan Cumayao.


Such being the case, the next question to be resolved is: Not being legitimate, are appellees entitled to inherit from their father, Juan Cumayao?


The Supreme Court sheds light on this matter in 
Castro vs. Court
 of Appeals (173 SCRA 656, 662 to 663):




Under the Civil Code, whether new or old, illegitimate children . . . were generally classified into two groups: (1) Natural, whether actual or by fiction, were those born outside of lawful wedlock of parents who, at the time of conception of the child, were not disqualified by any impediment to marry each other . . . and (2) Spurious, whether incestuous, adulterous or illicit, were those born of parents who, at the time of conception, were disqualified to marry each other on account of certain legal impediments.




x x x           x x x          x x x




Under the Civil Code, for an illegitimate child other than natural to inherit, she must first be recognized voluntarily or by court action. . . . 
This arises from the legal principle that an unrecognized spurious child like a natural child has no rights from her parents or to their estate because her rights spring not from the filiation or blood relationship but from the child's acknowledgment by the parent
 . . . . 
In other words, the rights of an illegitimate child arose not because she was the true and real child of her parents but because under the law, she has been recognized or acknowledged as such a child.




x x x           x x x          x x x




Under the Civil Code, there are two kinds of acknowledgment — voluntary or compulsory. 
The provisions on acknowledgment are applied to natural as well as spurious children
 . . . . Article 131 of the old Civil Code provides for voluntary acknowledgment by the father or mother, while Article 135 and Article 136 of the same Code provide for the compulsory acknowledgment by the father and mother respectively.


Article 131 of the old Civil Code states that the acknowledgment of a natural child must be made in the record of birth, in a will or in some other public document.




Naturally, and understandably so, plaintiffs-appellees did not present any evidence that they have been acknowledged by Juan Cumayao by reason of their original stand that they are legitimate children of Juan Cumayao. There being no proof that appellees were acknowledged by Juan Cumayao as his illegitimate children, appellees could not therefore legally inherit from the estate of the deceased Juan Cumayao.


If appellees are not entitled to inherit from Juan Cumayao, have they acquired ownership over the parcels of land in question
? As to the four (4) parcels of land under the First Cause of Action, Pedro Milan (TSN, September 1, 1964) and Victoriano Bingcoy (TSN, Hearings of September 1, 1964 and July 25, 1966) testified that appellees took possession of the parcels of land left by Juan Cumayao after his death on July 26, 1926, peacefully, continuously, adversely, openly and in the concept of owners up to 1948, or for a period of 
twenty two years,
 by introducing improvements thereon like abaca plants and coconut trees, harvesting fruits thereof, declaring the same for taxation purposes . . . and paying the corresponding realty taxes therefor. We find no evidence on the part of defendants-appellants controverting the same.


Under Section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Act No. 190, to wit:




Sec. 41. Title to land by prescription. — Ten years actual adverse possession by any person claiming to be the owner for that time of any land or interest in land, uninterruptedly continued for ten years by occupancy, descent, grants, or otherwise, in whatever way such occupancy may have commenced or continued, shall vest in every actual occupant or possessor of such land a full and complete title . . . .




It is not disputed that appellants have been in possession, as stated above, for 22 years in the concept of owners. Consequently, appellants' claim over the parcels of land in question have already prescribed. The trial court did not commit any error in awarding said parcels of land (under the First Cause of Action) to herein appellees.


As to the third assigned error . . . [c]onsidering that appellants' counsel had cross-examined appellees' witnesses despite the failure of counsel for appellees to offer their testimonies when they were called to testify, appellants are deemed to have waived their right to object to the admissibility of the testimonies. . . .


There is merit to appellants' claim that only Exhibits ""E"", ""F-1"", ""G-4"", and ""I"" should be considered by the court in rendering the decision, as the rest of the exhibits for appellees were withdrawn by their counsel (Order dated April 9, 1989).


However, in the interest of substantial justice and for equitable reasons considering that it is not disputed that the Perdicas Coliseum housing the court was burned last May 14, 1987 and the entire records of the case were lost including the documents marked as Exhibits ""G"", ""G-1"" to ""G-7"", ""H"", ""H-1"" to ""H-5"" and ""I"", described in the reconstituted ""Memorandum of Exhibits and Formal Offer of Evidence for the Plaintiffs"" . . . said descriptions of the burned documents may be considered and taken together as part of the positive and convincing testimony of appellee Victoriano Bingcoy (TSN, Hearing of July 25, 1977) which testimony sustains the findings of the trial court in favor of appellees. It cannot be over-emphasized that appellants did not present any evidence to controvert the testimony of appellee Victoriano on this matter.


The possession of the three (3) parcels of land by appellee Victoriano under the Second Cause of Action was acquired not through inheritance from Juan Cumayao but by donation in case of the first parcel of land covered by a document duly executed and thumbmarked by both donor Francisca Meriles and donee Victoriano . . . that had been lost in the fire; by purchase from Nicolas Abong in the case of the second parcel of land and covered by a document . . . and by purchase from Pascuala Bingcoy in case of the third parcel of land, the document evidencing the same having been destroyed during the war but with tax declaration in the name of appellee Victoriano . . . and payment of taxes therefor . . . together with the tax declaration . . . and payments of realty taxes . . . which were gutted by fire except Exh. ""G-4"" which is an official receipt for ratification fee. As already stated, there is no evidence presented by appellants controverting the above testimony of appellee Victoriano Bingcoy. Appellants failed to establish that they have better rights to the parcels of land subject matter of the Second Cause of Action.


With respect to the parcel of land under the Third Cause of Action . . . We find no evidence to sustain the finding of the trial court that said land was given to appellee Juan Cumayao.
ℒαwρhi৷
 No document was ever presented in court to prove the donation; and the realty taxes paid by appellee Agustin on said land started only in 1951, three years after appellees were ousted from the land in 1948. Considering that said parcel of land undisputedly belonged to Juan Cumayao, its ownership passed by inheritance to his heirs upon his death. And appellees not being entitled to inheritance as earlier discussed, the parcel of land properly pertains to herein appellants who are the surviving heirs of said decedent. We find no evidence that entitles appellee Agustin to acquisitive prescription under the Old Civil Code or Code of Civil Procedure.


As to the fourth assigned error: The testimonies of Milan and Victoriano Bingcoy establish the fact that appellees forcibly entered the parcels of land in question and ousted appellees therefrom by threatening Victoriano's life with a gun . . . . They were not controverted by the evidence of appellants. Neither Ricardo Genel nor Felisa Lumhod, witnesses for appellants, denied the aforesaid testimonies . . . . The trial court did not commit any error in finding that appellees were forcibly dispossessed by appellants in 1948. We have meticulously read the testimonies of appellants' witnesses . . . and not one of them disclaimed the acts of dispossession committed by appellant against appellees ousting the latter from the parcels of land in question.

As to the fifth assigned error, the Fourth Amended Complaint of appellees should be dismissed with respect only to the Third Cause of Action, for reasons already discussed above.

Pursuant to the above postulations, the respondent appellate court modified the decretal portion of the court 
a quo's
 decision insofar as the parcel of land subject of the Third Cause of Action is concerned. The modification runs in this wise:




WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is hereby MODIFIED to the effect that the dispositive portion should read as follows:


x x x           x x x          x x x




(c) Declaring 
Pedro Bingcoy, et al.
 the true and absolute owners of the parcel of land described in the Third Cause of Action of the Complaint as follows:




Bounded on the North by Agustin Bingcoy — 48.00 m; on the East by Agapito Morano — 74.00 m; on the South by Leon Sayre — 62.00 m; and on the west by Victoriano Bingcoy — 44.00 m; declared under Tax Decl. No. 6350, assessed at P90.00 for taxation.




(d) 
Ordering, plaintiff Agustin Bingcoy to deliver and restore possession of the parcel of land described in paragraph (c) of herein dispositive part of the Decision to defendants
;


(e) Ordering defendants to deliver and restore possession of all the parcels of land described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the dispositive part of this Decision to the plaintiffs;


(f) Condemning the defendants to pay the plaintiffs, jointly and severally the amount of P410.00 (under the First Cause of Action); 
and
 the amount of P44.00 (under the Second Cause of Action) a year starting from 1952 until possession of all the aforesaid parcels of land have been delivered and restored to the plaintiffs.


SO ORDERED.
48




Still not contented with the ruling of the respondent Court of Appeals which partly found their claims of ownership as heirs of Juan Cumayao, to be meritorious, although only insofar as the parcel of land under the Third Cause of Action is concerned, petitioners submit that the respondent appellate court committed grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed the trial court's award to private respondents of the parcels of land covered under the First and Second Causes of Action. They have assigned the following errors:




(1) On its own, the Honorable Court of Appeals shifted, or changed, the theory of the case and the issues litigated by the parties in Civil Case No. 2728;


(2) Assuming 
arguendo
 that only the emphasis in the aspect of the case is changed, or altered, private respondents' claim over the
 parcels
 of land (described in their First Cause of Action) is based on ""TITULO PUTATIVO"" and, as such, said claim ought to have been rejected;


(3) The Honorable Court of Appeals considered documentary evidence which were not formally re-offered in evidence below, or were withdraw, by private respondents; and,


(4) There is no harmony in the findings of fact in the Decision of the Court of Appeals such that it committed grave misapprehension of facts.
49




There is no merit to the instant petition.


There are two primary issues that need to be definitively resolved in this case:




(1) May private respondents obtain ownership by acquisitive prescription over the parcels of land described under the first and second causes of action although they, as unrecognized illegitimate children, have no inheritance rights thereto?


(2) May the trial court and the respondent Court of Appeals consider as basis for their decisions, documents that had been formally offered but were lost by fire and are thus no longer available for physical scrutiny but are adequately described in the direct testimony of the premiere witness in the case who was also cross-examined by the opposing party as regards the same documents?




Petitioners furiously take the negative side of both these issues, but they utterly fail to persuade us, as we instead believe that the trial court and the respondent Court of Appeals were correct in their findings and conclusions.


First. Petitioners insist that in order for private respondents to be qualified to become owners of the parcels of land under the first and second causes of action in accordance with our laws on acquisitive prescription, they should first have been entitled to the same parcels of land through succession because absent ""successional rights from their deceased parents, private respondents have NO MODE of acquiring ownership over said properties and their possession, if any, over said properties . . . 
could not ripen into ownership by prescription
""
50
 (emphasis theirs).


Petitioners' theory is absolutely erroneous. It only takes a cursory glance at Book III of the Civil Code of the Philippines to expose the ridiculousness of this contention. Book III is entitled, ""Different Modes of Acquiring Ownership"" and notably, Title V thereunder is denominated, ""Prescription"". Needless to say, acquisitive prescription is in itself a mode of acquiring ownership over a parcel of land and does not require, as petitioners asseverate, successional or inheritance rights, in order to ""ripen"" into ownership.


Significantly, there is nothing on the record that discloses even an attempt by petitioners to rebut the evidence of private respondents as to their peaceful, continuous, adverse, and open possession in the concept of owner over the parcels of land in question from July 26, 1926 until 1948 or for twenty two (22) years. Under the applicable law at that time, which was Section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Act No. 190, ""ten years of actual adverse possession by any person claiming to be the owner for that time of any land or interest in land, uninterruptedly continued for ten years by . . . whatever way such occupancy may have commenced or continued, shall vest in every actual occupant or possessor of such land a full and complete title"". Clearly, therefore, private respondents have become owners, by acquisitive prescription, of the parcels of land described in the first and second causes of action.


Petitioners' resort to a baseless legal argument, however, is understandable. They had never been armed with the evidence needed to prove their ownership of the subject parcels of land, and they even enhanced and confirmed private respondents' prior possession of the subject properties when their witnesses, namely, Ricardo Genel, Feliciano Cumayao, and Corazon Dagoy, failed to deny the acts of dispossession committed by petitioners against private respondents in that fateful year of 1948.


Second. It must have been stakingly obvious that the narration of the documents testified upon by private respondent Victoriano Bingcoy during the trial in September, 1964 and its continuation in July, 1966, in the first part of this
 ponencia,
 but which documents were lost to a courthouse fire in 1987, was not without a pre-determined purpose. That earlier narration deliberately enumerated and meticulously described each document in order to show that although said documents have no physical existence now, they were exhaustively testified upon, in the course of both direct and cross-examinations, and were properly offered in evidence by private respondents in open court, such that the trial court and the respondent appellate court could not, without committing procedural error and grave injustice, ignore their contents and their over-all import in rendering judgment.


Petitioners especially attack the inclusion of said documents by the trial court and the respondent Court of Appeals in their appreciation of the evidence in the instant controversy, because said documents have allegedly been withdrawn by private respondents at the behest of the petitioners. We can only surmise, however, that petitioners, by so contending with apparent desperation, are simply running out of tenable arguments.


We have carefully reviewed the records of the case and are convinced that the technical withdrawal of the documents in question, upon the insistent clamor of petitioners, does not operate to render nugatory the testimonial evidence attesting to the tenor and contents of the said documents. Neither does such a technicality work to justify the erosion, denial or annihilation of the truths undisputedly established by the questioned documents. The trial court and respondent Court of Appeals are courts of law and justice. It would be a gross subversion of their nature as such were they, in full awareness of the questioned documentary evidence proffered and marked during the hearings, affirmatively identified and unhamperedly testified to by the main witness in the case and undoubtedly formally offered by private respondents before the trial court, to consciously choose to sacrifice legalism for substantial justice.


WHEREFORE,
 the instant petition is 
HEREBY DISMISSED
 for lack of merit.


Costs against petitioners.
