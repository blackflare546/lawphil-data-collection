SECOND DIVISION


Â 


G.R. No. 119528 March 26, 1997


PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC., 
petitioner,

vs.


CIVIL AERONAUTICS BOARD and GRAND INTERNATIONAL AIRWAYS, INC., 
respondents.




TORRES, JR., 
J.:


This Special Civil Action for 
Certiorari
 and Prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeks to prohibit respondent Civil Aeronautics Board from exercising jurisdiction over private respondent's Application for the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, and to annul and set aside a temporary operating permit issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board in favor of Grand International Airways (GrandAir, for brevity) allowing the same to engage in scheduled domestic air transportation services, particularly the Manila-Cebu, Manila-Davao, and converse routes.


The main reason submitted by petitioner Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL) to support its petition is the fact that GrandAir does not possess a legislative franchise authorizing it to engage in air transportation service within the Philippines or elsewhere. Such franchise is, allegedly, a requisite for the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience or Necessity by the respondent Board, as mandated under Section 11, Article XII of the Constitution.


Respondent GrandAir, on the other hand, posits that a legislative franchise is no longer a requirement for the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or a Temporary Operating Permit, following the Court's pronouncements in the case of 
Albano vs. Reyes,
1
 as restated by the 
Court of Appeals in Avia Filipinas International vs. Civil Aeronautics Board
2
 and 
Silangan Airways, Inc. vs. Grand International Airways, Inc.,
 and the Hon. Civil Aeronautics Board.
3


On November 24, 1994, private respondent GrandAir applied for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Board, which application was docketed as CAB Case No. EP-12711.
4
 Accordingly, the Chief Hearing Officer of the CAB issued a Notice of Hearing setting the application for initial hearing on December 16, 1994, and directing GrandAir to serve a copy of the application and corresponding notice to all scheduled Philippine Domestic operators. On December 14, 1994, GrandAir filed its Compliance, and requested for the issuance of a Temporary Operating Permit. Petitioner, itself the holder of a legislative franchise to operate air transport services, filed an Opposition to the application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity on December 16, 1995 on the following grounds:




A. The CAB has no jurisdiction to hear the petitioner's application until the latter has first obtained a franchise to operate from Congress.


B. The petitioner's application is deficient in form and substance in that:




1. The application does not indicate a route structure including a computation of trunkline, secondary and rural available seat kilometers (ASK) which shall always be maintained at a monthly level at least 5% and 20% of the ASK offered into and out of the proposed base of operations for rural and secondary, respectively.


2. It does not contain a project/feasibility study, projected profit and loss statements, projected balance sheet, insurance coverage, list of personnel, list of spare parts inventory, tariff structure, documents supportive of financial capacity, route flight schedule, contracts on facilities (hangars, maintenance, lot) etc.




C. Approval of petitioner's application would violate the equal protection clause of the constitution.


D. There is no urgent need and demand for the services applied for.


E. To grant petitioner's application would only result in ruinous competition contrary to Section 4(d) of R.A. 776. 
5




At the initial hearing for the application, petitioner raised the issue of lack of jurisdiction of the Board to hear the application because GrandAir did not possess a legislative franchise.


On December 20, 1994, the Chief Hearing Officer of CAB issued an Order denying petitioner's Opposition. Pertinent portions of the Order read:




PAL alleges that the CAB has no jurisdiction to hear the petitioner's application until the latter has first obtained a franchise to operate from Congress.


The Civil Aeronautics Board has jurisdiction to hear and resolve the application. In 
Avia Filipina vs. CAB,
 CA G.R. No. 23365, it has been ruled that under Section 10 (c) (I) of R.A. 776, the Board possesses this specific power and duty.


In view thereof, the opposition of PAL on this ground is hereby denied.


SO ORDERED
.




Meantime, on December 22, 1994, petitioner this time, opposed private respondent's application for a temporary permit maintaining that:




1. The applicant does not possess the required fitness and capability of operating the services applied for under RA 776; and,


2. Applicant has failed to prove that there is clear and urgent public need for the services applied for.
6






On December 23, 1994, the Board promulgated Resolution No. 119(92) approving the issuance of a Temporary Operating Permit in favor of Grand Air 
7
 for a period of three months, 
i.
e.,
 from December 22, 1994 to March 22, 1994. Petitioner moved for the reconsideration of the issuance of the Temporary Operating Permit on January 11, 1995, but the same was denied in CAB Resolution No. 02 (95) on February 2, 1995. 
8
 In the said Resolution, the Board justified its assumption of jurisdiction over GrandAir's application.




WHEREAS , the CAB is specifically authorized under Section 10-C (1) of Republic Act No. 776 as follows:


(c) The Board shall have the following specific powers and duties:


(1) In accordance with the provision of Chapter IV of this Act, to issue, deny, amend revise, alter, modify, cancel, suspend or revoke, in whole or in part, upon petitioner-complaint, or upon its own initiative, any temporary operating permit or Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity; Provided, however; that in the case of foreign air carriers, the permit shall be issued with the approval of the President of the Republic of the Philippines.


WHEREAS, such authority was affirmed in 
PAL vs. CAB,
 (23 SCRA 992), wherein the Supreme Court held that the CAB can even on its own initiative, grant a TOP even before the presentation of evidence;


WHEREAS, more recently, 
Avia Filipinas vs. CAB,
 (CA-GR No. 23365), promulgated on October 30, 1991, held that in accordance with its mandate, the CAB can issue not only a TOP but also a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to a qualified applicant therefor in the absence of a legislative franchise, citing therein as basis the decision of 
Albano vs. Reyes
 (175 SCRA 264) which provides (
inter alia
) that:




a) Franchises by Congress are not required before each and every public utility may operate when the law has granted certain administrative agencies the power to grant licenses for or to authorize the operation of certain public utilities;


b) The Constitutional provision in Article XII, Section 11 that the issuance of a franchise, certificate or other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility does not necessarily imply that only Congress has the power to grant such authorization since our statute books are replete with laws granting specified agencies in the Executive Branch the power to issue such authorization for certain classes of public utilities.




WHEREAS, Executive Order No. 219 which took effect on 22 January 1995, provides in Section 2.1 that a minimum of two (2) operators in each route/link shall be encouraged and that routes/links presently serviced by only one (1) operator shall be open for entry to additional operators.


RESOLVED, (T)HEREFORE, that the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Philippine Airlines on January 05, 1995 on the Grant by this Board of a Temporary Operating Permit (TOP) to Grand International Airways, Inc. alleging among others that the CAB has no such jurisdiction, is hereby DENIED, as it hereby denied, in view of the foregoing and considering that the grounds relied upon by the movant are not indubitable.




On March 21, 1995, upon motion by private respondent, the temporary permit was extended for a period of six (6) months or up to September 22, 1995.


Hence this petition, filed on April 3, 1995.


Petitioners argue that the respondent Board acted beyond its powers and jurisdiction in taking cognizance of GrandAir's application for the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, and in issuing a temporary operating permit in the meantime, since GrandAir has not been granted and does not possess a legislative franchise to engage in scheduled domestic air transportation. A legislative franchise is necessary before anyone may engage in air transport services, and a franchise may only be granted by Congress. This is the meaning given by the petitioner upon a reading of Section 11, Article XII,
9
 and Section 1, Article VI, 
10
 of the Constitution.


To support its theory, PAL submits Opinion No. 163, S. 1989 of the Department of Justice, which reads:




Dr. Arturo C. Corona

Executive Director

Civil Aeronautics Board

PPL Building, 1000 U.N. Avenue

Ermita, Manila


Sir:


This has reference to your request for opinion on the necessity of a legislative franchise before the Civil Aeronautics Board (""CAB"") may issue a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity and/or permit to engage in air commerce or air transportation to an individual or entity.


You state that during the hearing on the application of Cebu Air for a congressional franchise, 
the House Committee on Corporations and Franchises contended that under the present Constitution, the CAB may not issue the abovestated certificate or permit, unless the individual or entity concerned possesses a legislative franchise.
 You believe otherwise, however, for the reason that under R.A. No. 776, as amended, the CAB is explicitly empowered to issue operating permits or certificates of public convenience and necessity and that this statutory provision is not inconsistent with the current charter.


We concur with the view expressed by the House Committee on Corporations and Franchises. In an opinion rendered in favor of your predecessor-in-office, this Department observed that, â


. . . it is useful to note the distinction between the franchise to operate and a permit to commence operation. The former is sovereign and legislative in nature; it can be conferred only by the lawmaking authority (17 W and P, pp. 691-697). The latter is administrative and regulatory in character (In re Application of Fort Crook-Bellevue Boulevard Line, 283 NW 223); it is granted by an administrative agency, such as the Public Service Commission [now Board of Transportation], in the case of land transportation, and the Civil Aeronautics Board, in case of air services. While a legislative franchise is a pre-requisite to a grant of a certificate of public convenience and necessity to an airline company, such franchise alone cannot constitute the authority to commence operations, inasmuch as there are still matters relevant to such operations which are not determined in the franchise, like rates, schedules and routes, and which matters are resolved in the process of issuance of permit by the administrative. (Secretary of Justice opn No. 45, s. 1981)


Indeed, authorities are agreed that a certificate of public convenience and necessity is an authorization issued by the appropriate governmental agency for the operation of public services for which a franchise is required by law (Almario, Transportation and Public Service Law, 1977 Ed., p. 293; Agbayani, Commercial Law of the Phil., Vol. 4, 1979 Ed., pp. 380-381).


Based on the foregoing, it is clear that a franchise is the legislative authorization to engage in a business activity or enterprise of a public nature, whereas a certificate of public convenience and necessity is a regulatory measure which constitutes the franchise's authority to commence operations. It is thus logical that the grant of the former should precede the latter.


Please be guided accordingly.


(SGD.) SEDFREY A. ORDONEZ

Secretary of Justice




Respondent GrandAir, on the other hand, relies on its interpretation of the provisions of Republic Act 776, which follows the pronouncements of the Court of Appeals in the cases of 
Avia Filipinas vs. Civil Aeronautics Board,
 and 
Silangan Airways, Inc. vs. Grand International Airways
 (
supra
).


In both cases, the issue resolved was whether or not the Civil Aeronautics Board can issue the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or Temporary Operating Permit to a prospective domestic air transport operator who does not possess a legislative franchise to operate as such. Relying on the Court's pronouncement in 
Albano vs. Reyes
 (
supra
), the Court of Appeals upheld the authority of the Board to issue such authority, even in the absence of a legislative franchise, which authority is derived from Section 10 of Republic Act 776, as amended by P.D. 1462. 
11


The Civil Aeronautics Board has jurisdiction over GrandAir's Application for a Temporary Operating Permit. This rule has been established in the case of 
Philippine Air Lines Inc., vs. Civil Aeronautics Board,
 promulgated on June 13, 1968. 
12
 The Board is expressly authorized by Republic Act 776 to issue a temporary operating permit or Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, and nothing contained in the said law negates the power to issue said permit before the completion of the applicant's evidence and that of the oppositor thereto on the main petition. Indeed, the CAB's authority to grant a temporary permit ""upon its own initiative"" strongly suggests the power to exercise said authority, even before the presentation of said evidence has begun. Assuming 
arguendo
 that a legislative franchise is prerequisite to the issuance of a permit, the absence of the same does not affect the jurisdiction of the Board to hear the application, but tolls only upon the ultimate issuance of the requested permit.


The power to authorize and control the operation of a public utility is admittedly a prerogative of the legislature, since Congress is that branch of government vested with plenary powers of legislation.




The franchise is a legislative grant, whether made directly by the legislature itself, or by any one of its properly constituted instrumentalities. The grant, when made, binds the public, and is, directly or indirectly, the act of the state. 
13






The issue in this petition is whether or not Congress, in enacting Republic Act 776, has delegated the authority to authorize the operation of domestic air transport services to the respondent Board, such that Congressional mandate for the approval of such authority is no longer necessary.


Congress has granted certain administrative agencies the power to grant licenses for, or to authorize the operation of certain public utilities. With the growing complexity of modern life, the multiplication of the subjects of governmental regulation, and the increased difficulty of administering the laws, there is a constantly growing tendency towards the delegation of greater powers by the legislature, and towards the approval of the practice by the courts. 
14
 It is generally recognized that a franchise may be derived indirectly from the state through a duly designated agency, and to this extent, the power to grant franchises has frequently been delegated, even to agencies other than those of a legislative nature. 
15
 In pursuance of this, it has been held that privileges conferred by grant by local authorities as agents for the state constitute as much a legislative franchise as though the grant had been made by an act of the Legislature. 
16


The trend of modern legislation is to vest the Public Service Commissioner with the power to regulate and control the operation of public services under reasonable rules and regulations, and as a general rule, courts will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion when it is just and reasonable and founded upon a legal right. 
17


It is this policy which was pursued by the Court in 
Albano vs. Reyes.
 Thus, a reading of the pertinent issuances governing the Philippine Ports Authority, 
18
 proves that the PPA is empowered to undertake by itself the operation and management of the Manila International Container Terminal, or to authorize its operation and management by another by contract or other means, at its option. The latter power having been delegated to the to PPA, a franchise from Congress to authorize an entity other than the PPA to operate and manage the MICP becomes unnecessary.


Given the foregoing postulates, we find that the Civil Aeronautics Board has the authority to issue a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, or Temporary Operating Permit to a domestic air transport operator, who, though not possessing a legislative franchise, meets all the other requirements prescribed by the law. Such requirements were enumerated in Section 21 of R.A. 776.


There is nothing in the law nor in the Constitution, which indicates that a legislative franchise is an indispensable requirement for an entity to operate as a domestic air transport operator. Although Section 11 of Article XII recognizes Congress' control over any franchise, certificate or authority to operate a public utility, it does not mean Congress has exclusive authority to issue the same. Franchises issued by Congress are not required before each and every public utility may operate. 
19
 In many instances, Congress has seen it fit to delegate this function to government agencies, specialized particularly in their respective areas of public service.


A reading of Section 10 of the same reveals the clear intent of Congress to delegate the authority to regulate the issuance of a license to operate domestic air transport services:




Sec. 10. Powers and Duties of the Board. (A) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Board shall have the power to regulate the economic aspect of air transportation, and shall have general supervision and regulation of, the jurisdiction and control over air carriers, general sales agents, cargo sales agents, and air freight forwarders as well as their property rights, equipment, facilities and franchise, insofar as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provision of this Act.




In support of the Board's authority as stated above, it is given the following specific powers and duties:




(C) The Board shall have the following specific powers and duties:


(1) In accordance with the provisions of Chapter IV of this Act, to issue, deny, amend, revise, alter, modify, cancel, suspend or revoke in whole or in part upon petition or complaint or upon its own initiative any Temporary Operating Permit or Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity: Provided however, That in the case of foreign air carriers, the permit shall be issued with the approval of the President of the Republic of the Philippines.




Petitioner argues that since R.A. 776 gives the Board the authority to issue ""Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity"", this, according to petitioner, means that a legislative franchise is an absolute requirement. It cites a number of authorities supporting the view that a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity is issued to a public service for which a franchise is required by law, as distinguished from a ""Certificate of Public Convenience"" which is an authorization issued for the operation of public services for which no franchise, either municipal or legislative, is required by law. 
20


This submission relies on the premise that the authority to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity is a regulatory measure separate and distinct from the authority to grant a franchise for the operation of the public utility subject of this particular case, which is exclusively lodged by petitioner in Congress.


We do not agree with the petitioner.


Many and varied are the definitions of certificates of public convenience which courts and legal writers have drafted. Some statutes use the terms ""convenience and necessity"" while others use only the words ""public convenience."" The terms ""convenience and necessity"", if used together in a statute, are usually held not to be separable, but are construed together. Both words modify each other and must be construed together. The word 'necessity' is so connected, not as an additional requirement but to modify and qualify what might otherwise be taken as the strict significance of the word necessity. Public convenience and necessity exists when the proposed facility will meet a reasonable want of the public and supply a need which the existing facilities do not adequately afford. It does not mean or require an actual physical necessity or an indispensable thing. 
21






The terms ""convenience"" and ""necessity"" are to be construed together, although they are not synonymous, and effect must be given both. The convenience of the public must not be circumscribed by according to the word ""necessity"" its strict meaning or an essential requisites. 
22






The use of the word ""necessity"", in conjunction with ""public convenience"" in a certificate of authorization to a public service entity to operate, does not in any way modify the nature of such certification, or the requirements for the issuance of the same. It is the law which determines the requisites for the issuance of such certification, and not the title indicating the certificate.


Congress, by giving the respondent Board the power to issue permits for the operation of domestic transport services, has delegated to the said body the authority to determine the capability and competence of a prospective domestic air transport operator to engage in such venture.
âÎ±wÏhià§·
 This is not an instance of transforming the respondent Board into a mini-legislative body, with unbridled authority to choose who should be given authority to operate domestic air transport services.




To be valid, the delegation itself must be circumscribed by legislative restrictions, not a ""roving commission"" that will give the delegate unlimited legislative authority. It must not be a delegation ""running riot"" and ""not canalized with banks that keep it from overflowing."" Otherwise, the delegation is in legal effect an abdication of legislative authority, a total surrender by the legislature of its prerogatives in favor of the delegate. 
23






Congress, in this instance, has set specific limitations on how such authority should be exercised.


Firstly, Section 4 of R.A. No. 776, as amended, sets out the following guidelines or policies:




Sec. 4. Declaration of policies. In the exercise and performance of its powers and duties under this Act, the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Civil Aeronautics Administrator shall consider the following, among other things, as being in the public interest, and in accordance with the public convenience and necessity:




(a) The development and utilization of the air potential of the Philippines;


(b) The encouragement and development of an air transportation system properly adapted to the present and future of foreign and domestic commerce of the Philippines, of the Postal Service and of the National Defense;


(c) The regulation of air transportation in such manner as to recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of, assure the highest degree of safety in, and foster sound economic condition in, such transportation, and to improve the relations between, and coordinate transportation by, air carriers;


(d) The promotion of adequate, economical and efficient service by air carriers at reasonable charges, without unjust discriminations, undue preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices;


(e) Competition between air carriers to the extent necessary to assure the sound development of an air transportation system properly adapted to the need of the foreign and domestic commerce of the Philippines, of the Postal Service, and of the National Defense;


(f) To promote safety of flight in air commerce in the Philippines; and,


(g) The encouragement and development of civil aeronautics.






More importantly, the said law has enumerated the requirements to determine the competency of a prospective operator to engage in the public service of air transportation.




Sec. 12. Citizenship requirement. Except as otherwise provided in the Constitution and existing treaty or treaties, a permit authorizing a person to engage in domestic air commerce and/or air transportation shall be issued only to citizens of the Philippines 
24


Sec. 21. Issuance of permit. The Board shall issue a permit authorizing the whole or any part of the service covered by the application, if it finds: (1) that the applicant is fit, willing and able to perform such service properly in conformity with the provisions of this Act and the rules, regulations, and requirements issued thereunder; and (2) that such service is required by the public convenience and necessity; otherwise the application shall be denied.




Furthermore, the procedure for the processing of the application of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity had been established to ensure the weeding out of those entities that are not deserving of public service. 
25


In sum, respondent Board should now be allowed to continue hearing the application of GrandAir for the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, there being no legal obstacle to the exercise of its jurisdiction.


ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Court RESOLVED to DISMISS the instant petition for lack of merit. The respondent Civil Aeronautics Board is hereby DIRECTED to CONTINUE hearing the application of respondent Grand International Airways, Inc. for the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
