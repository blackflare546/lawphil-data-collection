G.R. No. 117684 January 30, 1997


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, 
plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


CLODUALDO CABILLAN, 
accused-appellant.




VITUG, 
J.:


An information, dated 21 October 1992, filed with the court 
a quo 
charged Clodualdo Cabillan with rape, to wit:




That on or about August 7, 1992, in the Municipality of Sto. Tomas, Province of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of Alienaven Aida Devaras, against her will.


CONTRARY TO LAW.
1




The plight and traumatic experience in the early life of private complainant Alienaven Aida Devaras was recounted in the decision
2
 
of the trial court.


Alienaven, born in Manila on 29 April 1977, was an illegitimate child of Bienvenida Devaras. Some time in 1980, she and her mother moved to the Davao Penal Colony (""DAPECOL"") where the latter met and later married Clodualdo Cabillan, an inmate. The marriage, contracted in 1983 between Clodualdo and Bienvenida, saw the birth of the couple's children, namely, Agronoemi, Clodualdo, Jr. and Rommel. Following Clodualdo's release from prison in 1988, the family started to reside in Sto. Tomas, Davao.


Upon attaining the age of eleven years, Alienaven began to be subjected to sexual abuse by her stepfather. The attack on her virtue kept on for about two or three times a week. The threat on her life had gagged her for years but the incident on 07 August 1992, the subject matter of the information, was to be the last straw. On that day of 07 August 1992, while Bienvenida, then a laundry woman, was doing her daily washing at the house of a neighbor, Clodualdo returned home from a billiard game. He found Alienaven, by then already fifteen years of age and a High-School sophomore, going through her school work. He told Agronoemi, Clodualdo, Jr., and Rommel to leave the house and to play at the creek. Once the children had left, Clodualdo started to make his sexual advances on Alienaven. Alienaven resisted but, frightened by the double-bladed knife wielded by her stepfather, she, once again, was unable to fend the bestial act.


This time, however, Alienaven had enough courage to seek the assistance of Ella Caballero, an employee of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (""DSWD""). She also had herself medically examined. The results disclosed these findings:




1. Old healed lacerated wounds at the 7:00 o'clock and 10:00 o'clock of the hymen;


2. Admits three (3) fingers of the examinee into the vagina with ease.
3




Clodualdo denied the charges. He cited various reasons, reiterated in this appeal and hereinafter discussed, why he could not have committed the offense charged.


On 12 July 1994, the trial court convicted the accused. The dispositive portion of the decision read:




WHEREFORE, finding the accused Clodualdo Cabillan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE, punishable under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, the court hereby sentences said accused to suffer a penalty of 
RECLUSION PERPETUA,
 together with the accessory penalties provided by law, to pay the costs, and is hereby further ordered to indemnify the victim by the way of moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00, in accordance with the current case doctrine of the Supreme Court.


SO ORDERED.

The Court, in this appeal, sees no sound reason to overturn the conviction. Certainly, looking at the records, the trial court cannot be faulted for giving credence to the testimony of private complainant. Alienaven's account of the incident, delivered straightforwardly, was narrated in a manner that is typical of young victims of rape. Thus —

A young girl's revelation that she has been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and her willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction.
6
 
Here, particularly, the person she has accused is her own stepfather.
7
 
It would be highly improbable for a girl of her age to fabricate a charge so humiliating to herself and her family as well had she not been truly subjected to the pain and the harrowing experience of sexual abuse.
8


The Court rejects the argument of accused-appellant that the rape could not have been committed without thereby courting the curiosity of neighbors who live nearby.
ℒαwρhi৷
 Lust is no respecter of time and precinct;
9
 
it can be committed in most unlikely places 
10
 
such as in a park, along a roadside, within school premises, or even in an occupied room. 
11


Neither can the Court accept the averment that at an age of 62 years, accused-appellant would be unable to indulge in the sexual act. Except for his self-serving testimony, there is utterly no proof to support the claim. Accused-appellant has admitted that he suffers from no ailment, 
12
 
and that, in fact, he still does heavy work. 
13


Appellant would, regrettably, even sullen the reputation of Alienaven by pointing to her supposed sexual experience in the past not only with him but also with others. This attempt will not detract the Court from the established fact that in the particular instance complained of, the sexual congress has taken place against the will of the victim. 
14


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED 
in toto.
 Costs against accused-appellant.


SO ORDERED.


Padilla, Bellosillo, Kapunan and Hermosisima, Jr. JJ., concur.
