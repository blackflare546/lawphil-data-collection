AMENDED DECISION


AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, 
J.:


In the Decision dated October 11, 2005 in the above-entitled case, the Court dismissed the petition and affirmed the CA Decision dated December 16, 1999. The dispositive portion of the Court’s Decision reads:


WHEREFORE
, the petition is DISMISSED. The Court of Appeals Decision dated December 16, 1999 and its Resolution dated March 21, 2000 in CA-G.R. CV No. 31587 is AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.


The Court sustained the CA’s affirmance of the RTC Decision dated March 9, 1990, which ordered the reconveyance of the property to respondents. Nevertheless, the Court found that the portion sold by Placida Tabada-Lambo to respondents under the 1968 Deed of Sale of Real Property should pertain only to 4,000 square meters and not 4,300 square meters, inasmuch as what Placida sold under said 1968 Deed of Sale can only affect her ¼ share in the 16-hectare co-owned property.
