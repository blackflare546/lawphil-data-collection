SANCHEZ, 
J.:


Original petition for 
certiorari
 and prohibition to annul the proclamation of Patricio Dumlao — made on January 2, 1964 by the substitute board of canvassers of Nueva Vizcaya — as Governor-elect of said province. We declined to issue the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for to stop respondent Patricio Dumlao ""from asserting or exercising any power, prerogative or duties pertaining to the Office of Provincial Governor""; the Commission on Elections from taking any action to implement its resolutions and orders leading to the proclamation on January 2, 1964 just stated; and then Assistant Executive Secretary Calixto O. Zaldivar (now an Associate Justice of this Court) from implementing in any manner the Presidential decision recognizing respondent Dumlao as Provincial Governor.


The facts, so the record discloses, are as follows:


Registered candidates for Governor of Nueva Vizcaya in the November 12, l963 elections were petitioner Corazon M. Espino and respondent Patricio Dumlao.


On November 19, 1963, Dumlao lodged with the Commission on Elections (Comelec) a petition praying that Comelec direct the provincial board of canvassers of Nueva Vizcaya to use Comelec's copies of the election returns from six precincts in the Municipality of Aglipay, Nueva Vizcaya, because till then, the Provincial Treasurer had not received the copies corresponding to him.


On November 20, 1963, Comelec issued an order enjoining the board from canvassing the election returns without Comelec's, prior order. On December 2, 1963, the board nonetheless proceeded to canvass the returns from the entire province.

 The copies of the election returns from the six precincts of Aglipay for the Provincial Treasurer, were received in the afternoon of that day — December 2, 1963.


Meanwhile, on December 3, 1963, Comelec directed by wire its representative in Nueva Vizcaya, Atty. Saturnino L. Mayor, to authorize the use of the long delayed returns copies for the Provincial Treasurer covering the six precincts aforesaid, provided that the delay in their transmission was satisfactorily explained, and provided further that said returns were not tampered; ""otherwise board of canvassers shall use election returns copies for mun treas Aglipay."" Atty. Mayor advised the board of canvasser of this directive. He asked that he be given a chance to investigate and satisfy himself of the existence of the two conditions.

 He was overruled by the board. Instead, the board proceeded to tally the votes in Aglipay using the election returns copies for the Provincial Board.


On December 4, 1963, Atty. Mayor made an examination of the copies for the Provincial Treasurer, of the returns from the six precincts of Aglipay. His findings: (1) the envelopes containing said returns were slit at the bottom: (2) the paper seals of the returns inside were already broken; and (3) the words and figures in the returns bore visible traces of erasures.


The comparative figures explanatory of the discrepancy, as stated in the petition herein, are as follows:
