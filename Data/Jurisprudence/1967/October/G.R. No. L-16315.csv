ENTRY OF JUDGMENT NUNC PRO TUNC




I, BIENVENIDO EJERCITO, Clerk of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, do hereby certify that on the 
30th
 day of 
May
, nineteen hundred and
 sixty-four
 A.D., a decision rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case was filed in this office, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:




""WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is reversed and set aside, with costs.""




and that the same has become final and executory in accordance with the Court's resolution of March 15, 1967.




Manila, May 15, 1967


 




(SGD.) BIENVENIDO EJERCITO

Clerk of Court






Copy of the above entry of judgment having been served on respondent, the latter on the 23rd of the present month filed an urgent motion asking that it be furnished with this Court's resolution of March 15, 1967 mentioned in the entry of judgment aforesaid, of which resolution it had not been served with a copy. It appears that our resolution of March 15, 1967 is one addressed exclusively to the Clerk of Court for him to make the corresponding entry of judgment, of which the parties in the case are not served with notice.


WHEREFORE, respondent's urgent motion mentioned above is hereby denied.


Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles and Fernando JJ.,
 concur.
