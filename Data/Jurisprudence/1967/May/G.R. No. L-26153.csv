WHEREAS, there is now pending before the Supreme Court a Case docketed as G.R.

URBINA, ALVARO PASTOR, JR., and REFRAIN C. PELAEZ as defendants-appellants:


WHEREAS, the parties in the above-mentioned case have agreed, to settle the disputes and claims being litigated in the case under the following terms and conditions, to wit:




1. In consideration of the sum of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P100,000.00) Philippine Currency, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by Gualberto Tenchavez (hereinafter referred to as ""TENCHAVEZ"") as full and complete payment, settlement and discharge of any and all claims and causes of action of TENCHAVEZ involved or being litigated in G.R. No. L-26153 and of any and all claims and causes of action of whatsoever kind and nature that TENCHAVEZ had, now has or could or might have against Atlas Consolidated Mining & Development Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ""ATLAS""), Mindanao Mother Lode Mines, Inc., Manuel Lim, James E.

Misa, Carlos Guidotti, Sebastian Ugarte, Gerry Urbina, Pilar Urbina, Jose Trillo, Mercedes Urbina and Efrain C.

3. The aforementioned case has caused TENCHAVEZ the alienation from him of the love and affection of the other members of his family and of his friends, because of certain accusations which TENCHAVEZ made against them and he hopes that with the dismissal of the complaint and the appeal in said case, the whole accident will be forgotten.


4.

6. ATLAS, Mindanao Mother Lode Mines, Inc., Manuel Lim, James E. Norton, Jose Tiong Sen Ben, Marcelo P. Karaan, Escolastico Cruz, S. Z. Misa, Carlos Guidotti, Sebastian Ugarte, Gerry Urbina, Jesus Urbina, Jr., Pilar Urbina, Jose Trillo, Mercedes Urbina, Pilar G. Urbina, Efrain C.
