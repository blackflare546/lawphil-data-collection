CONCEPCION, 
C.J.:


Petitioner Emilia Somodio seemingly seeks the review by 
certiorari 
of an order of Commissioner Rufo S. Sucaldito, of the Eighth Regional District of the Court of Agrarian Relations. 


Said Mrs. Somodio is admittedly the owner of a small tract of land of about two (2) ""fanegas"", located in the barrio of Bita-og-Taytay, municipality of Zarraga, province of Iloilo, which had been cultivated by Isidro Sotelo, as her tenant. On June 8, 1962, the latter filed with said Regional District a complaint — docketed as CAR Case No. 1284 — alleging that he had been cultivating said land, as Mrs. Somodio's tenant, since 1952; that, on or about May 29, 1962, after he had prepared the seedbed and plowed half of the land Mrs. Somodio — who had, prior thereto, threatened to eject him therefrom — caused the remaining portion of the land to be plowed by her agents; that she had, for several years, given him less than the share due him under the law; and that, despite his demands, she had refused to give him the balance of the share to which he was legally entitled. Sotelo prayed, therefore, that a writ of preliminary injunction be issued restraining Mrs. Somodio or her agents from threatening to dispossess, or committing acts tending to dispossess him of said land and that, after due hearing, said injunction be made permanent and Mrs. Somodio ordered to deliver to him the aforementioned balance of his share, as well as to pay attorney's fees and other expenses of litigation. 


Upon denial of a motion to dismiss of Mrs. Somodio, she filed her answer denying some allegations of the complaint and admitting other allegations thereof, and affirming, 
inter alia
, that Sotelo had been her tenant, but only from 1959 to 1961; and that, in the latter year, he voluntarily returned the land to Mrs. Somodio. She, likewise, set up a counterclaim for moral damages and attorney's fees. 


Subsequently, or on July 16, 1962, Sotelo filed an urgent motion for a preliminary injunction, which was not objected to by Mrs. Somodio, despite the fact that her counsel had seasonably received copy thereof. Before passing upon the merits of said motion, Commissioner Sucaldito of the aforementioned Regional District, issued an order authorizing Atty. Salvador Baylon, a Legal Aide of the CAR, to conduct an ocular inspection, on July 22, 1962, at 9:00 a.m., in the presence of the parties or their authorized representatives, and find out who among the parties is in actual, physical possession of the land. Immediately after making said ocular inspection, Atty. Baylon, submitted his report stating that the land is in the material possession of Sotelo. The next day, or on July 23, 1962, Commissioner Sucaldito issued the order complained of, directing Mrs. Somodio ""to desist from disturbing, harassing, or threatening"" Sotelo; ""to refrain from working"" on said land; and ""to maintain petitioner peacefully thereon until final determination of this case."" 


On July 31, 1962, Mrs. Somodio moved for the reconsideration of said order and filed an 
ex-parte 
urgent motion to stay the execution thereof. But both were denied on August 1, 1962. On August 22, 1962, Mrs. Somodio filed with this Court the herein petition for review by 
certiorari
, praying, 
inter alia
, that said petition be given due course, pursuant to Republic Act No. 1267, Section 13; that the order of respondent Sucaldito dated August 1, 1962 be declared null and void; and that, pending decision by this Court, a writ be issued suspending the execution of the order of July 23, 1962. On October 10, 1962, this Court issued said writ.

The present proceedings should be dismissed. 


To begin with, it purports to be an appeal under Section 13, of Republic Act No. 1267, which is quoted on the margin.
1
 Said provision refers, however, to 
final 
orders or decisions of the Court of Agrarian Relations. It is inapplicable to the orders complained of, the same being interlocutory.
2
 In fact, no decision or final order has as yet been rendered, either by the Court of Agrarian Relation or by Commissioner Sucaldito. 


If Mrs. Somodio did not agree with the orders of July 23 and August 1, 1962, her remedy was to appeal to the Associate Judge assigned to the Eighth Regional District the CAR, but Mrs. Somodio has not done so. 


Thirdly, the records do not show that Commissioner Sucaldito had abused his discretion in issuing said orders. It should be noted, in this connection, that one of the main issues — if not the most important issue — raised in the pleadings is whether or not Sotelo was actually in possession of the landholding in question, and that, before passing upon the merits of Sotelo's urgent motion for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, Commissioner Sucaldito caused an ocular inspection to be made in the presence of Mrs. Somodio and her counsel and that the ocular in inspection revealed that the party in possession of the litigated land is Sotelo, not Mrs. Somodio. 


Fourthly, although a bond had not been filed by Sotelo before the issuance of said writ, this appears be justified by the language of Rule 11 of the Rules of the CAR. Indeed, Section 3 of said Rule 11
3
 explicity authorizes CAR Commissioners to ""issue interlocutory orders in ejectment cases directing the landholder to desist from ejecting the tenant from the landholding pending the final determination of the case on its merits,"" 
without 
requiring a bond. Upon the other hand, Section 2 of the same Rule 
expressly 
provides that the Court may require, not only a bond, but ""a 
cash 
bond"" to stay the execution of the aforementioned interlocutory orders.
4
 Thus, the intent to permit the issuance thereof, without requiring a bond therefor, is manifest. What is more, it is easily understandable, for, otherwise, the order of desistance would, in many, if not most, cases, be useless since tenants generally have no property that could serve as security for a bond.


Wherefore, the petition herein should be, as it is hereby dismissed, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this Court on October 10, 1962, dissolved, with costs against petitioner Emilia Somodio. 


It is so ordered. 


Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Regala Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez and Castro, JJ., concur.
