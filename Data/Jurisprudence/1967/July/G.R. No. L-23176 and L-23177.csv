REYES, J.B.L., 
Actg. C.J.:


This is a petition for review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, which reversed the joint decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal in the 
certiorari 
case, entitled ""Fortunato Cruz, et al. vs. Pablo R. Tongco, et al."" (Civ. Case No. 4942) and the action for recovery of possession of real property, entitled ""Pablo A. Tongco vs. Fortunato Cruz, et al."" (Civ. Case No. 4991).


The facts of these cases, as found by the Court of Appeals, may be stated as follows:


Lot No. 26, Block 3 of the Tambobong Estate, formerly belonging to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, was originally leased by one Catalina Guevara who, in 1926, allegedly, donated her leasehold right to Pablo R. Tongco. 


In 1937, Fortunato Cruz leased from Tongco 175 square meters of the abovementioned lot whereon the former built his residential house, paying to the latter monthly rentals therefor. In 1938, his brother Eugenio Cruz, who also built his house on the lot, became a lessee of another portion (of Lot No. 26), with an area of 150 square meters. After the Estate was acquired by the government in 1947, the Cruz brothers, ""on instruction of the Rural Progress Administration, continued paying rentals but this time direct to the office of the Rural Progress Administration.""


Claiming to be 
bona-fide 
tenants and occupants, the Cruz brothers thereafter applied to the Rural Progress Administration for the purchase of the portions of Lot No. 26 occupied by them, which were then referred to as Lots No. 26-A and 26-D. The application was opposed by Pablo Tongco, who also filed an application, contending that as lessee thereof, he has preference to purchase the whole of Lot No. 26.
