CONCEPCION, 
C.J.:


Petition for review by 
certiorari
 of a decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations granting the petition of herein respondents, Rodrigo Macapagal and ten (10) other persons,
1
 for a change of their tenancy contract with petitioners herein, Glicerio Tinio and Teodora Limban, from share to leasehold system, as provided in Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, granting the tenant the unilateral right to make such change.
2


Petitioners assail the constitutionality of the grant of said option as a denial of both due process and equal protection. These objections have, however, been repeatedly rejected by this Court,
3
 upon the ground that the contested legal precept is a reasonable and valid exercise of the police power of the State, to afford a relief to a socioeconomic problem existing in the Philippines, and we find no justification to revise or, otherwise alter our view thereon. Wherefore, the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioners-appellants. It is so ordered.
