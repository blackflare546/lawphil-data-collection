DIZON, 
J.:


This is an original action for 
certiorari
 on the ground of lack of jurisdiction and/or grave abuse of discretion filed against the Public Service Commission and other parties. The order of the Commission complained of was issued on March 5, 1964 and granted to each of one-hundred twenty-five applicants and oppositor counter-applicants
 provisional permits
 to operate taxicab units principal party in the City of Manila totalling in all 1,000 units.

On September 25, 1964 Jose M. Silva, one of the respondents, filed a motion to dismiss the present case upon the ground that on September 4 of the same year, the respondent Commission had rendered its decision granting
 permanent certificates of public convenience
 to him and his herein co-respondents, either confirming or increasing the number of units granted to each of them under its order of March 5, 1964 mentioned in the preceding paragraph, this obviously rendering the present action for 
certiorari
 moot and of no practical importance. A copy of the said decision rendered by the respondent Commission was attached to the motion to dismiss.


Required to answer the motion aforesaid, petitioners, on October 26, 1964, made of record that they interpose no objection to the dismissal of the following cases:
