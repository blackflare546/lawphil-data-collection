DOMINGO PO CHU SAM,

vs.


REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES,
 oppositor-appellant.


V. S. Caamiño for petitioner-appellee.

Office of the Solicitor General for oppositor-appellant.




SANCHEZ, 
J.:


State's appeal from a judgment of the Misamis Occidental court admitting Domingo Po Chu Sam to Philippine citizenship. The case must go for the State. The petition avers that petitioner has an annual income of P2,400.00, more or less. His income tax return for 1961, the year he filed his petition, shows that his income was P2,514.74, consisting of P1,514.74 in salary and P1,000.00 in bonus. Contingent and speculative, bonus is not to be reckoned in determining his income. Married, without a child, petitioner's income of P1,514.74 does not meet the requirement of lucrative occupation (Section 2 Naturalization Law; Yu Kian Chie vs. Republic, L-20169, February 26, 1965; Co vs. Republic, L-19502, April 29, 1966).

Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the petition for naturalization of Domingo Po Chu Sam is denied. Cost against petitioner. So ordered.
