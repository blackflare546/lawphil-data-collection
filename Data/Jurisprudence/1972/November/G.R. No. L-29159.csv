p


These two (2) cases were jointly tried before and decided by the Court of First Instance of Catanduanes, owing to the identical issues raised therein, namely, the validity of two ordinances of the Municipality of Virac, the herein defendant-appellant.

Approved, September 30, 1966.






Both ordinances were assailed upon the ground that they partake of the nature of a tax on imports or exports and a tax on purchases, as well as double taxation; that they effect an increase in taxes by more than 50% ""without the requisite approval of the Secretary of Finance that the taxes imposed are unjust, excessive and confiscatory; and that the imposition thereof is 
ultra vires
. Shortly after the filing of the complaints in Case No. 588 of the lower court — L-29160 of this Court — the trial court, on motion of the plaintiffs, ordered the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the defendants from enforcing Ordinance No. 5, series of 1966, pending the resolution of said case on the merits.


In due course, thereafter, said court rendered a decision, the dispositive part of which We quote:






WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Court hereby finds Sections 3(a), 3(b) and 3(i) of Ordinance No. 6, Series of 1965 under question in Civil Case No. 581 and Section 1 of Ordinance No. 5, Series of 1966 under question in Civil Case No. 588, null and void, as contrary to the provisions of subsection 3 of section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 472 and section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264. Unless purged of their infirmity, the provisions are unenforceable.


In Civil Case No. 581, the defendants are hereby ordered to reimburse to the plaintiffs the taxes paid by them under protest, as follows: 






(1) Celestino Tatel .............................................	P3,659.50 

(2) Juan Molina .................................................	3,330.00 

(3) Ang Kee Hian ..............................................	3,432.00 

(4) Ang Ban Giok ..............................................	5,464.00 

(5) Tio Son Kuan ..............................................	834.00 

(6) Bennie Co. ...................................................	1,604.00 






In Civil Case No. 588, the defendants are ordered to reimburse the taxes paid by the plaintiffs also under protest, as follows: 






(1) Gulf Fibers Corporation ..............................	P2,845.00 

(2) Juan Molina ..................................................	3,142.50 

(3) Celestino Tatel .............................................	3,000.00 

(4) Ang Ban Giok ...............................................	2,952.00 

(5) Ang Kee Hian ...............................................	2,346.00 

(6) Bennie Co. .....................................................	1,201.00 

(7) Liu Lim ...........................................................	435.00










with interest at the legal rate from the time of the filing of the complaint up to final judgment.






The preliminary injunction is hereby made permanent.


With costs against the defendants.


SO ORDERED.






Hence, this appeal by the Municipality of Virac.


The decision appealed from declared said ordinances illegal upon the ground that they provide for an increase in taxes by more than 50% without the approval of the Secretary of Finance and that they impose taxes on articles subject to specific tax, as well as over forest products.


We are unable to share this view. To begin with, the provision of Commonwealth Act No. 472 requiring the prior approval
 
of the Secretary of Finance, when an ordinance increases by more than 50% municipal taxes prescribed in previous ordinances, has been impliedly repealed by Republic Act No. 2264, which vests in municipal, city and municipal district councils ample discretion to impose taxes and even municipal license taxes, and, instead of demanding said
 prior approval 
of the Secretary of Finance to ordinances increasing taxes by more than 50% of the previous rates, vests in said official no more than the authority to 
suspend
 the effectivity of any ordinance, within 120 days after its passage, when, in his opinion, the taxes imposed are ""unjust, excessive, oppressive or confiscatory."" 


Moreover, the ordinances in question do not tax specific goods. They impose license taxes, or regulate and tax those engaging in the businesses or occupations, or exercising the privileges, therein enumerated. They categorize said businesses, occupations or privileges on the basis of the nature thereof — such as ""merchants, sari-sari store owners, wholesale and retail dealers of general merchandise,"" manufacturers of 

hollow-blocks or similar products, lumber yards, etc. — or of the products they handle — such as pharmaceutical products, rice and corn, abaca and copra, furniture, rattan and nipa shingles, liquor or tobacco. Some of these categories are sub-classified, depending upon whether the business or occupation being taxed is undertaken with or without machineries, or whether the lumber yard is merely for deposit, or without a ""yard"" properly, ""but with space to keep already sawed lumber and with office to accept orders for lumber.""


Secondly, the license tax prescribed in each category is graduated, the amount thereof being dependent upon the ""capital investment or purchases for the previous year, whichever is higher.""


The power to impose such license taxes is explicitly authorized in Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 2264, which provides that:






SEC. 2.	
Taxation
. — Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, all chartered cities, municipalities and municipal districts shall have authority to impose municipal license taxes or fees upon persons engaged in any occupation or business or exercising privileges in chartered cities, municipalities or municipal districts by requiring them to secure licenses at rates fixed by the municipal board or city council of the city, the municipal council of the municipality, or the municipal district council of the municipal district; to collect fees and charges for service rendered by the city, municipality or municipal district; to regulate and impose reasonable fees for services rendered in connection with any business, profession or occupation being conducted within the city, municipality or municipal district and otherwise to levy for public purposes, just and uniform taxes, licenses or fees: 
Provided
, That municipalities and municipal districts shall, in no case, impose any percentage tax on sales or other taxes in any form based thereon nor impose taxes on articles subject to specific tax, except gasoline, under the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code: 
Provided, however
, That no city, municipality or municipal district may levy or impose any of the following: 


(a)	Residence tax; 


(b)	Documentary stamp tax; 


(c)	Taxes on the business of persons engaged in the printing and publication of any newspaper, magazine, review or bulletin appearing at regular intervals and having fixed prices for subscription and sale, and which is not published primarily for the purpose of publishing advertisements; 


(d)	Taxes on persons operating waterworks, irrigation and other public utilities except electric light, heat and power; 


(e)	Taxes on forest products and forest concessions; 


(f)	Taxes on estates, inheritances, gifts, legacies, and other acquisitions 
mortis causa
; 


(g)	Taxes on income of any kind whatsoever; 


(h)	Taxes or fees for the registration of motor vehicles and for the issuance of all kinds of licenses or permits for the driving thereof; 


(i)	Customs duties registration, wharfage on wharves owned by the national government, tonnage and all other kinds of customs fees, charges and dues; 


(j)	Taxes of any kind on banks, insurance companies, and persons paying franchise tax;


(k)	Taxes on premiums paid by owners of property who obtain insurance directly with foreign insurance companies; and


(l)	Taxes, fees or levies, of any kind, which in effect impose a burden on exports of Philippine finished, manufactured or processed products and products of Philippine cottage industries.


A tax ordinance shall go into effect on the fifteenth day after its passage, unless the ordinance shall provide otherwise: 
Provided, however
, That the Secretary of Finance shall have authority to suspend the effectivity of any ordinance within one hundred and twenty days after its passage, if, in his opinion, the tax or fee therein levied or imposed is unjust, excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory, and when the said secretary exercises this authority the effectivity of such ordinance shall be suspended.


In such event the municipal board or city council in the case of cities and the municipal council or municipal district, council in the case of municipalities and municipal districts may appeal the decision of the Secretary of Finance to the court during the pendency of which case the tax levied shall be considered as paid under protest.






It should be noted that, under the penultimate paragraph of the foregoing section, the power of the Secretary of Finance is limited to 
suspending
 ordinances imposing taxes that he considers ""unjust, excessive, oppressive or confiscatory,"" and that the 
only
 qualification of that power is that it be exercised within 120 days after the passage of the ordinance. What is more, his action may be
 appealed 
to the courts of justice, unlike the power of approval or disapproval given to said officials under Section 4 of Com. Act No. 472, reading:






SEC. 4.	The approval of the Secretary of Finance shall be secured:


(1)	Whenever the rates of municipal license taxes fixed or imposed by ordinance of the municipal council or municipal district council by virtue of the provisions of this Act exceed the rates of fixed internal revenue privilege taxes regularly imposed by the National Government upon the same businesses or occupation, except on hotels, restaurants, cafes, refreshment parlors, race tracks, and retail dealers in vino liquors and fermented liquors, and any tax or fee on livery stables, garages, and other places or establishments where public vehicles and other conveyances are kept for hire;


(2)	Whenever the rate of fixed municipal license taxes on businesses not excepted in this Act or otherwise covered by the preceding paragraph and subject to the fixed annual tax imposed in section one hundred eighty-two of the National Internal Revenue Law, is in excess of fifty pesos per annum; and


(3)	Whenever the municipal license tax on any business, occupation, or privilege the rate of which is not limited above is increased by more than fifty
 per centum
.

Considering that the purpose of Rep. Act No. 2264 is to grant more autonomy to our local governments, 
1
 
and that the object of section 2 thereof is identical to that of Com. Act No. 472, We are satisfied that the provisions of the latter — relied upon by 

plaintiffs-appellees herein and applied by the lower court — have been repealed by the Local Autonomy Act (Rep. Act No. 2264). And this is borne out by the statements made on the floor of the House of Representatives, during the consideration of the Bill which later became R.A. No. 2264. Thus: 






MR. YANCHA: But is not the gentleman aware of the fact that the taxes being imposed under this proposed measure are practically the same taxes that are now being imposed by the municipal council? 


MR. ZOSA: Now, gentleman from Samar, they are not. Under Commonwealth Act 472, these are not the same taxes. The power of the municipality to tax under the present law is 
limited
, but
 this bill removes the limitation
, so that under this amendment of the Committee
 the power to tax has become very broad
.


MR. YANCHA: If the gentleman from Cebu reads section 3, he will find that there is a limitation to the taxing power of the Municipal Council being proposed in the amendment.


MR. ZOSA: Yes, but if the gentleman reads Commonwealth Act 472, together with that amendment, he will realize that the power of taxation given under this amendment has become very broad.


MR YANCHA: Precisely, because 
the purpose of this law is to give more local autonomy
 if he will not increase their finances, and the only way to increase the finances of municipalities is to broaden a little bit their power of taxation so that they will not be burdening the national government by asking certain things that they cannot do themselves.

Further confirmation of Our view on this point is supplied by Provincial Circulation No. 24, of the Secretary of Finance — the officer principally charged with the duty to enforce tax measures, and whose views thereon, although mainly persuasive, carry much weight — dated March 31, 1960, in which, referring to the effect of said R.A. No. 2264 upon his power of approval (or disapproval) under C.A. No. 472, said official said:






In lieu
 of the power of approval of the rates of municipal taxes in certain instances granted the Secretary of Finance under Sec. 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 472, said official is now authorized to 
suspend 
the effectivity of any ordinance within one hundred and twenty days after its passage, if, in his opinion, the tax or fees therein levied or imposed is unjust, excessive, oppressive or confiscatory.






Neither is there any merit in the theory that the contested ordinances impose taxes on specific goods, or on forest products, which are excluded by section 2 of R.A. No. 2264 from the general power of taxation therein granted, inasmuch as the rate of taxation imposed in said ordinances is dependent upon the ""capital investment or purchases for the previous year"" — which, likewise, reflects the ""capital Investment"" — ""whichever is higher."" It is Our considered view that the nature of the business or occupation taxed, and the amount invested therein, which is, also, reflected in the ""purchases"" — not the ""sales"" — made ""for the previous year"" are reasonable grounds for the classification made in said ordinances and the graduated taxes imposed therein.


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby reversed, with costs against plaintiffs-appellees herein. It is so ordered.


Zaldivar, Castro, Fernando, Barredo, Makasiar, Antonio and Esguerra, JJ., concur.


Makalintal, J., is on leave.

TEEHANKEE, 
J., 
concurring and dissenting: 


I concur in the main opinion of the Chief Justice insofar as it upholds the validity of the questioned municipal ordinances imposing municipal license taxes on all persons engaged in any business, occupation or in the exercise of privilege within the Municipality of Virac, Catanduanes, on a progressive scale based on the 
capital investment 
of the business, which, as therein stated, is a reasonable ground for the classification made in the said ordinances and for the graduated taxes imposed therein.


I am constrained to dissent, however, where such taxes are imposed on an alternative basis of ""(
capital investment
 or)
 purchases for the previous year, whichever is higher
"" and imposes what amounts to percentage tax, in addition to the basic tax, of, for instance, P10.00
 per annum for every P1,000 in excess of P10,000 of purchases for the previous year
 in the case of ""merchants, wholesale or retail dealers of lumber materials.""
1
 
This amounts to one (1%) per cent for every P10,000 of purchases and is thus easily determinable as a percentage of the purchases made by the taxpayer. 
2
 


Similar percentage taxes based on the amount of 
purchases for the previous year
 are imposed on general merchants, sari-sari store owners, wholesale or retail dealers of general merchandise, pharmaceutical products, rice and corn, merchants (buyers and sellers) of abaca and copra, proprietors or operators of bakery and other food products, and wholesale or retail dealers of rattan and nipa shingles. 
3




The merchants concerned ""are required to submit a statement of their
 purchases 
from January to June, 1965 on or before July 10, 1965 and to submit their monthly purchases on or before the 10th day of the subsequent months which should be under oath in a prescribed form from the office of the municipal treasurer, where the report shall be submitted.""


I respectfully submit that such progressive taxes fall within the express prohibition of section 2 of R.A. No. 2264 that ""municipalities ... shall, in no case, impose any 
percentage tax
 on 
sales
 or other 
taxes in any form based thereon
 ..."" and that using purchases rather than sales as the basis for the tax should be taken as a transparent device to go around the statute's limitations, since the purchases made by merchants are obviously for 
sales
 purposes in the ordinary course of business.


The graduated taxes so imposed, based on the monthly purchases of the merchants and required to be reported within the 10th day of the following month to the municipal treasurer for the imposition of the tax should be held to violate the prohibition against municipalities imposing any
 percentage tax
 or any other form of tax based on 
sales
. This would be in consonance with the Court's ruling in Marinduque 
4


that ""the ordinance in question, while not providing for a percentage tax, but a graduated tax (the progressive tax therein reposed not being 
calculated on a percentage 
of the sales made by the taxpayer), nevertheless, (it) prescribes a
 tax based on sales
, contrary to the statute (R.A. 2264). It is true that the ordinance purports to base the tax on either ""gross output or sales;"" but the 
only standard
 provided for measuring the 
gross output
 is its
 peso value
, as determined from ""true copies of receipts and/or invoices (which are precisely the evidence of sales) that the taxpayer is required to submit to the municipal treasurer (section 3), without deduction being provided for freight insurance, or incidental costs. 
Directly or indirectly
, the amount of payable tax under this ordinance is determined by the gross sales of the taxpayer, and violates the explicit prohibition that the municipality must not levy, or impose, ""taxes in any form based on sales.""


I vote, therefore, in partial affirmance of the appealed decision, for declaring the questioned ordinances invalid insofar as they would impose the taxes hereinabove referred to on the basis of the plaintiffs-appellees' ""purchases for the previous year"" rather than simply on the basis of their capital investment.
