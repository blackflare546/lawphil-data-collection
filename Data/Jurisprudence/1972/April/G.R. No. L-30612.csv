Such a comment was received on March 27, 1972. According to the then Solicitor General, now Associate Justice, Felix Q. Antonio: ""On March 15, 1972, the Director of Prisons, pursuant to the letter-request of the undersigned, submitted to the Office of the Solicitor General a copy of the certificate of death of Bonifacio Alison, Prisoner No. 9486, 45 years old, male, with address at Bo. Pasig, Claveria, Masbate; The data appearing in the aforesaid death certificate and those in the records of the case (handwritten notes of the proceedings by the Presiding Judge of the trial court, pp. 320-321, rec.) show that the Bonifacio Alison mentioned therein are one and the same person; The death of accused-appellant Bonifacio Alison having been established, and considering that there is as yet no final judgment in view of the pendency of the appeal, the criminal and civil liability of the said accused-appellant Alison was extinguished by his death (Art. 89, Revised Penal Code; Reyes' Criminal Law, 1971. Rev. Ed., p. 717, citing People vs. Castillo and Ofemia C.A., 56 O.G. 4045); consequently, the case against him should be dismissed.""
