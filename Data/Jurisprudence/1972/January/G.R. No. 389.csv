Respondent Armando Puno, of Zamboanga City, in Administrative Case No. 389, petitions for the lifting of the disbarment decree issued against him by this Court in its decision of 28 February 1967,
1
 
pleading that since then he has striven to lead and has led a model and exemplary life, despite the hardships undergone by him and his family. His exemplary conduct since his disbarment is attested by public officials and civic organizations of Zamboanga City, specially the local chapters of the Jaycees and the Boy Scouts, the Family Workshop of the Philippines, the Zamboanga City Amateur Athletic Federation and the Amateur Basketball Association, in which he has served as officer thereof. All of them have certified to this petitioner's proper and irreproachable behaviour during the past four years. 


Considering that the complainant has expressed no objection to his reinstatement in the practice of the law, provided said respondent supports his child by the aforesaid complainant, to which condition respondent Armando Puno has expressly agreed: and considering that this Court is now convinced that said respondent has evidenced his moral reform and willingness to atone for the misconduct that led to his exclusion from the bar, and will endeavor in the future to lead an upright and irreproachable life, assiduously avoiding occasion to bring the profession into disrepute. 


As prayed for, respondent Armando Puno is ordered reinstated in the practice of the law as a member of the Philippine Bar, subject to the conditions that (1) he shall formally acknowledge his child, Armando Puno, Jr., now in the care of the mother, complainant Flora Quingwa, and (2) the said petitioner will provide a minimum amount of P125.00 per month for the support of said child starting from 31 January 1971. Let the name of said respondent be restored to the roll of attorneys upon his taking anew the corresponding oath of office before this Court, and upon his submittal of the formal acknowledgment of his child. So ordered. 


Concepcion, C.J., Makalintal, Zaldivar, Castro, Fernando, Teehankee, Barredo, Villamor and Makasiar, JJ., concur.
