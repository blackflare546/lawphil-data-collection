QUISUMBING, 
J.:


This special civil action for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assails the resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission promulgated on May 17, 1991, which modified the decision of the labor arbiter.


Respondent company is a domestic corporation engaged in road construction projects of the government. From 1968 to 1989, it engaged the services of the following workers to work on various projects on different dates: Rodolfo Monteclaro (mechanic), Edgar Juesan
1 
 (painter), Victorio Lunzaga (tanker driver), Alfredo Jalet (batteryman), Julito Macabodbod (trailer helper), Ramon Tabada (carpenter), Remsy
2 
 Asensi (machinist), Armand Acero (helper mechanic), Lordito Tatad (painter helper), Rogelio Tantuan (painter), Teodoro Tabio (checker), Gemudo
3 
 Asejo (electrician), Roland Olivar (latheman), Valeriano Mijas
4 
 (driver), Jose Noval (welder), Felimon Lagbao (mechanic), Pedro Roche (head welder), and Justiniano Sollano (carpenter). Their contracts indicate the particular project they are assigned, the duration of their employment and their daily wage.

In February 1989, the above-named workers joined petitioner union as members. Accordingly, petitioner union filed a petition for certification election with the regional office of the labor department. Respondent company opposed the petition on the ground that the workers were project employees and therefore not qualified to form part of the rank and file collective bargaining unit. Not for long, the Med-Arbiter dismissed the petition for certification election. On appeal, the Secretary of Labor and Employment reversed the Med-Arbiter's decision and ordered the immediate holding of a certification election.


Meanwhile, the national president of petitioner union sent a demand letter to respondent company seeking the payment of wage differentials to some affected union members. As said demand was unheeded, petitioner union and the concerned workers filed a complaint for payment of wage differentials and other benefits before the Regional Office of the Department of Labor and Employment.


Shortly thereafter, respondent company terminated the employment of aforementioned workers owing to the completion of its projects or the expiration of workers' contracts. Respondent company explained the circumstances surrounding the separation of the workers from the service as follows:




(1)	The Contract No. 2AIPD-C-10 Second Agusan Irrigation Project of NIA wherein some of the herein complainants were assigned was already 98% completed when complaints were filed. With the near completion of the contract, services of the following complainants were no longer needed:




(a)	Gerundio Asejo


(b)	Victorio Lunzaga


(c)	Ramon R. Tabada


(d)	Alfredo E. Julet (
sic
)


(e)	Julito C. Macabodbod




(2)	In the case of Contract No. 2AIPD-C-11-second Agusan Irrigation Project of NIA, the following complainants were terminated because of the 95% completion of the phase of the project and expiration of their contract of employment:




(a)	Remsy B. Asensi


(b)	Rolando G. Olivar


(c)	Edgar A. Juezan


(d)	Rodolfo G. Monteclaro


(e)	Valeriano S. Meyas (
sic
)


(f)	Jose F. Noval


(g)	Pedro M. Roche




(3)	In Contract Package R11 1/209, Davao del Norte, the contracts of employment of Armand T. Acero and Felimon J. Dagbao (
sic
) Jr. expired.


(4)	In the Widening and Improvement of Rafael Castillo St., Davao City Project, where complainant Teodoro Tabio was assigned, he was terminated because he went on absent without leave (AWOL) while Lordito Tatad's contract of employment expired.

However, the affected workers claim that they were dismissed because of their union activities. In view of the alleged illegal dismissals and harassment by their employer, the workers staged a strike on May 17, 1989. Upon complaint of respondent company, Labor Arbiter Newton Sancho declared said strike illegal and decreed further that Victorio Lunzaga, Alfred Jalet, Julito Macabodbod, Ramon Tabada and Remsy Asensi, who had participated in the strike, were deemed to have lost their employment status.


On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission affirmed said decision. Petitioner union then elevated the matter to this Court by way of petition for 
certiorari
 which was eventually dismissed.

Meanwhile, the aggrieved workers filed with the Regional Arbitration Branch of the NLRC their individual complaints against private respondent company for illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, underpayment of wages, 13th month pay, holiday pay and overtime pay. They also sought reinstatement with back wages. The cases were consolidated and assigned to Labor Arbiter Nicolas Sayon for arbitration. However, noting that a similar case had been filed before the regional office of the labor department, the labor arbiter refrained from resolving the issue of underpayment of monetary benefits. He also found the charge of unfair labor practice untenable. But, on the charge of illegal dismissal, he ruled on October 31, 1989, as follows:




WHEREFORE in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the dismissal of the following complainants illegal; namely:




1. Victorio C. Lunzaga


2. Julito C. Macabodbod


3. Alfredo E. Jalet


4. Gerundio F. Asejo


5. Ramon R. Tabada




Respondent ALGON Engineering Construction Corporation and Alex Gonzales and Edith Yap, are hereby ordered to reinstate the above-named complainants to their former positions without loss of seniority rights plus six months backwages based on their latest salary rate at the time of their dismissal, which is P65.00 per day equivalent to monthly rate of P1,700.83, a total of P10,204.99 per complainant or in the total amount of P51,024.95.


The case of illegal dismissal filed by Armand Acero, Lordito Tatad, Teodoro Tabio, Ramon Olivar, Valeriano Miyas, Jose Noval, Felimon Lagbao, Pedro Roche, Remsy Asensi, Rodolfo Monteclaro, Edgar Juesan and Justiniano Sollano are hereby ordered dismissed for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED.

Petitioners and private respondents separately appealed the Labor Arbiter's ruling to the National Labor Relations Commission. Pending appeal, Edgar Juesan, Lordito Tatad and Ramon Tabada filed their respective duly sworn affidavits of desistance and motions to withdraw their complaints and money claims against private respondents. Said motions were seasonably granted.


On May 17, 1991, the NLRC promulgated its resolution modifying the decision of Labor Arbiter Nicolas Sayon. It held that the labor arbiter erred in not resolving the issue of underpayment of wages because not all of the original complainants filed the same money claims with the labor department.

 Thus, it awarded monetary benefits to qualified workers. The NLRC disposed of the case as follows:


Accordingly, the appealed decision is hereby modified as follows:




1. Respondent ALGON Engineering Construction Corporation is hereby ordered to pay the complainants hereinafter enumerated, the following sums:


WAGE DIFFERENTIALS:
