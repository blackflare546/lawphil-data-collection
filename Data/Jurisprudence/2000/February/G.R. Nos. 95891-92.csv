The prosecution's version of the incident as summed in the people's brief:




In the morning of November 1, 1986, Francisco Salva was riding on a horse and pasturing some cows and carabaos within the premises of Hacienda Ong located in Lumagaob, Barrio Sainz, Mati, Davao Oriental.
9


Thereupon, he saw two boys gathering young coconuts.
10
 Salva approached the two boys and asked them why they were gathering young coconuts and the two boys replied that ""they were thirsty"".
11


Thereafter, Salva reported the matter to appellant (who was overseer of the Hacienda) and the latter promptly ordered Salva and some other persons including accused Edgar Gibone to board a jeep which he drove to the place where the two boys were gathering coconuts.
12
 When they arrived at the place, the two boys were already on a hill, prompting appellant and his group to chase them, but they failed to catch them.
13


Thereafter, appellant and his companions returned to appellant' s house bringing with them two bundles of firewood allegedly gathered and left by the two boys. When they arrived at appellant's house, appellants and his companions ""ate"" and thereafter appellant sent somebody to fetch accused Rolando Tano and Jack.
14


Later in the afternoon, Rolando Tano and Jack arrived at appellant's house. Thereupon, Salva and Edgar Gibone were summoned by appellant and were instructed to go with Rolando Tano and Jack to the place where the two boys were earlier seen gathering coconuts to apprehend them should they return.
15
 Upon arriving at the place, they allegedly hid in the ""Canyan tree"" and after a while the two boys appeared. After a brief chase, they were able to catch the two boys. The two boys were ""hand-tied"" and brought to the house of Joaquin Reyes.
16


Upon reaching the house of Joaquin Reyes, Jack ordered Salva and Gibone to hide.
17
 Thereafter, Jack and Tano asked Felisa Reyes, the wife of Joaquin Reyes, for water to drink and also instructed the latter to fetch appellant at the latter's house.
18


Felisa Reyes complied with the request and proceeded to appellant's house and informed the latter that two persons were waiting for him in her house. She described the two persons to appellant who, in turn, told her that said persons were Jack and Boy Negro.
19


Thereafter, appellant instructed Felisa Reyes to go home as he and his companions ""will just follow"".
20
 Felisa Reyes went back home and after a while appellant, together with two other persons arrived. Upon seeing the two boys, appellant allegedly started scolding them and called them thieves.
21


After scolding the two boys, appellant and jack had a conversation during which they allegedly agreed that the two boys be killed.
22
 Thereafter, appellant and his two companions left. Jack then ordered Salva and Gibone to proceed to the ""dead creek"" which they promptly did.


Later on, Jack, Rolando Tano and the two boys also arrived at the ""dead creek"" followed by appellant.
23


At the ''dead creek"", Jack removed the shirts of the two boys upon being ordered to do so by appellant.
24
 Jack and Rolando Tano tore the shirts and with the torn shirts covered the mouths of the two boys.
25
 Jack stabbed the smaller of the two boys, who was later identified as Napoleon Aldeguer, with a bolo at the latter's abdomen.
26
 Upon being stabbed, Napoleon fell to the ground as Jack kept on stabbing him.
27


Jack handed the bolo to Rolando Tano and the latter started stabbing the other boy who was later identified as Mateo Aldeguer.
28


Rolando Tano handed the bolo to Edgar Gibone who was threatened by Jack that should he not stab Mateo Aldeguer, he will, in turn, be stabbed by Jack. Edgar Gibone complied by stabbing Mateo Aldeguer.
29


Edgar Gibone was instructed by Jack to hand the bolo to Salva but the latter refused to accept the bolo prompting Jack to threaten him with death. Salva accepted the bolo and hacked the left thigh of Napoleon Aldeguer as instructed by Jack.
30


Jack took the bolo from Salva and hacked the neck of Napoleon Aldeguer.
31


After stabbing the Aldeguers, Jack and Rolando Tano left and ""followed"" the dead creek. Appellant Edgar Gibone and Salva left and proceeded to the house of one Nardo where appellant allegedly warned Gibone and Salva ""not to reveal what happened.
32


Later in the day, Rolando Tano and Jack allegedly arrived at the house of appellant and were met by the latter in his office where he gave each a small envelope.
33


In the afternoon of November 2, 1986, the bodies of Napoleon and Mateo Aldeguer were found in Hacienda Ong.
