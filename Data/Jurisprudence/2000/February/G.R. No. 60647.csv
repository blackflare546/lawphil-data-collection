THE ASSOCIATED ANGLO-AMERICAN TOBACCO CORPORATION,
 petitioner,

vs.


COURT OF APPEALS, ANDRES LAO, JOSE LAO, and TOMAS LAO,
 respondents. 


PURISIMA, 
J.:


These consolidated petitions for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court revolve around discrepant statements of accountability between a principal and its agent in the sale of cigarettes.


The common factual background at bar follows:


On April 6, 1965, The Associated Anglo-American Tobacco Corporation (Corporation for brevity) entered into a ""Contract of Sales Agent"" with Andres Lao. Under the contract, Lao agreed to sell cigarettes manufactured and shipped by the Corporation to his business address in Tacloban City. Lao would in turn remit the sales proceeds to the Corporation. For his services, Lao would receive commission depending on the kind of cigarettes sold, fixed monthly salary, and operational allowance. As a guarantee to Lao's compliance with his contractual obligations, his brother Jose and his father Tomas executed a deed of mortgage
1
 in favor of the Corporation in the amount of P200,000.00.


In compliance with the contract, Lao regularly remitted the proceeds of his sales to the Corporation, generating, in the process, a great deal of business. Thus, the Corporation awarded him trophies and plaques in recognition of his outstanding performance from 1966 to 1968. However, in February 1968 and until about seven (7) months later, Lao failed to accomplish his monthly sales report. In a conference in Cebu, Ching Kiat Kam, the President of the Corporation, reminded Lao of his enormous accounts and the difficulty of obtaining a tally thereon despite Lao's avowal of regular remittances of his collections.


Sometime in August and September 1969, Esteban Co, the vice-president and general manager of the Corporation, summoned Lao to Pasay City for an accounting. It was then and there established that Lao's liability amounted to P525,053.47. And so, Lao and his brother Lao Y Ka, enlisted the services of the Sycip Gorres and Velayo Accounting Firm (SGV) to check and reconcile the accounts.


Ching Kiat Kam allowed Lao to continue with the sales agency provided Lao would reduce his accountability to P200,000.00, the amount secured by the mortgage. The Corporation thereafter credited in favor of Lao the amount of P325,053.47 representing partial payments he had made but without prejudice to the result of the audit of accounts. However, the SGV personnel Lao had employed failed to conclude their services because the Corporation did not honor its commitment to assign two of its accountants to assist them. Neither did the Corporation allow the SGV men access to its records.


Subsequently, the Corporation discovered that Lao was engaging in the construction business so much so that it suspected that Lao was diverting the proceeds of his sales to finance his business. In the demand letter of April 15, 1979,
2
 counsel for the Corporation sought payment of the obligations of Lao, warning him of the intention of the Corporation to foreclose the mortgage. Attached to said letter was a statement of account indicating that Lao's total obligations duly supported by receipts amounted to P248,990.82.


Since Lao appeared to encounter difficulties in complying with his obligations under the contract of agency, the Corporation sent Ngo Kheng to supervise Lao's sales operations in Leyte and Samar. Ngo Kheng discovered that, contrary to Lao's allegation that he still had huge collectibles from his customers, nothing was due the Corporation from Lao's clients. From then on, Lao no longer received shipments from the Corporation which transferred its vehicles to another compound controlled by Ngo Kheng. Shipments of cigarettes and the corresponding invoices were also placed in the name of Ngo Kheng.


On May 21, 1970, Andres, Jose and Tomas Lao brought a complaint for accounting and damages with writ of preliminary injunction
3
 against the Corporation, docketed as Civil Case No. 4452 before the then Court of First Instance of Leyte, Branch I in Tacloban City, which court
4
 came out with its decision
5
 on March 26, 1975, disposing as follows:




IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING PREMISES, and upon a clear preponderance of evidence in favor of the plaintiffs, the court hereby renders judgment as follows:




1.	Ordering both the plaintiffs and defendant corporation to undergo a Court supervised accounting of their respective account with the view of establishing once and for all, by a reconciliation of their respective books of accounts, the true and correct accountability of Andres Lao to the defendant corporation. Pursuant thereto, both plaintiff Andres Lao and the defendant The Associated Anglo-American Tobacco Corporation are directed to make available all their records pertainting [
sic
] to their business transactions with each other under the contract of sales agent, from 1965 up to the time Andres Lao ceased being the agent of the defendant. A Committee on Audit is hereby formed to be composed of three (3) members, one member to be nominated by the plaintiffs, another to be nominated by the defendant corporation and the third member who shall act as the Committee Chairman to be appointed by this Court. As Committee Chairman, the Court hereby appoints the Branch Clerk of Court of this Court, Atty. Victorio Galapon, who shall immediately convene the Committee upon appointment of the other two members, and undertake to finish their assigned task under his decision within two (2) months.


2.	Ordering the defendant corporation to pay Plaintiffs the amount of P180,000 representing actual loss of earnings.


3.	Ordering the defendant to pay plaintiffs moral damages in the amount of P130,000.00.


4.	Ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs, exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00.


5.	Ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs, attorney's fees in the amount of P40,000.00.


6.	Ordering the plaintiffs and the defendant to pay the compensation of the commissioners pro-rata.


7.	Finally ordering the defendant to pay the cost of this suit.




SO ORDERED.






The Committee of Audit that was eventually constituted was composed of Atty. Victorio L. Galapon, Jr., as chairman, Wilfredo Madarang, Jr. and Cesar F.P. Corcuera, as representatives of the Corporation, and Lao himself. On September 16, 1976, said committee submitted a report
