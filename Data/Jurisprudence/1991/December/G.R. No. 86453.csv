(Rollo, pp. 26-27)




The appellant raises the following assignment of errors, to wit:


I


THE COURT 
A QUO
 ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH MULTIPLE HOMICIDE.


II


ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY AS CHARGED, THE COURT 
A QUO
 ERRED IN IMPOSING UPON HIM THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA ON THREE (3) COUNTS. (Appellant's Brief, p. 1)


The appellant contends that the evidence presented by the prosecution is not sufficient to convict him of the crime of robbery with multiple homicide. But before we discuss the assigned errors, we would like to comment on the crime charged. He alleges that there is no evidence of the taking of the wristwatches, the Betamax machine and its accessories. In fact, the Betamax machine and its accessories were still in the house but were only moved from their usual setting. As to the wristwatches, he state that the testimony of Pat. Orig who related to the court that Pfc. Chua frisked him and found two wristwatches and the push button of the Betamax machine, is hearsay evidence as Orig had no personal knowledge of said fact as he was not the one who frisked the appellant. The appellant likewise, alleges that there is no evidence linking him to the killing as no one actually saw him kill the victims.


These allegations must fail.


But before we discuss the following errors, we would like to comment on the crime charged.The designation of the crime as robbery with multiple homicide is incorrect. Assuming that a complex crime was committed, it should be categorized as robbery with homicide regardless of the number of persons killed by reason or on occasion of the robbery. (People v. Maranion, G.R. No. 90672-73, July 18, 1991; People v. Nunag, G.R. No. 92570, April 22, 1991)


The taking of the wristwatches and the remote control gadget of the Betamax machine has been established by the testimony of Orig. The appellant was caught red-handed in possession of the wristwatches, belonging to the victims Ricardo and Alicia Rivera, and the remote control of the Betamax machine. Such testimony of Orig is not hearsay as Orig was personally present when Pfc. Chua frisked the appellant and found the aforementioned articles in the appellant's possession. He had personal knowledge of the frisking and the items found on the appellant; therefore, his testimony cannot be categorized as hearsay evidence.


Because the appellant was caught in possession of the stolen property, he is presumed to be the taker in the absence of satisfactory explanation of his possession. This is in accordance with Rule 131 Section 3 (j) of the Revised Rules on Evidence (Rule 131, Section 5 (j) of the Rules of Court) which states:


That a person found in possession of a thing taken in the doing of a recent wrongful act is the taker and the doer of the whole act; otherwise, that things which a person possesses, or exercises acts of ownership over, are owned by him.


In the case at bar, the appellant did not offer any explanation as to the property found on him.


With regards to the killing, although it is true that there was no eyewitness to the actual killing of the victims, there are several circumstances, which when pieced together will lead to a definite conclusion that the appellant actually perpetrated the killing. These circumstances pointing clearly to the guilt of the appellant are: (1) the prosecution witnesses placed the appellant at the scene of the crime; he, himself, testified that he was there. (2) Sanchez and Orig, saw the appellant with a knife (3) Fernandez-Rivera stated that the appellant took out a bladed instrument, approached her and Alicia and brandished the weapon at them. She also saw the appellant lunge at Alicia (4) Silvestre saw Ricardo Rivera already dead, saw the appellant holding a knife stained with blood and saw that the appellant had bloodstains on the upper portion of his pants. The appellant admitted on cross examination that his pants were covered with blood. Silvestre also stated that the appellant admonished him not to touch Alicia.


Direct evidence of the appellant's participation in the actual stabbing is not necessary when circumstantial evidence sufficiently establishes that fact. (People v. Santito, Jr., G.R. No. 91628, August 22, 1991 citing People v. Roa, 167 SCRA 116, 122 [1988]) Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if (1) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. (Rule 133, Section 4, Revised Rules on Evidence; formerly Rule 133, Section 5, Rules of Court) All the aforementioned requisites are present in the instant case.


From the foregoing, the records show beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant killed the three victims and took the wristwatches and the remote control of the Betamax machine. The fact, however, are not adequate to convict the appellant of the crime of robbery with homicide. To sustain a conviction for this special complex crime, the original criminal design of the culprit must be robbery and the homicide is perpetuated with a view to the consummation of the robbery, by reason or on the occasion of the robbery (People v. Manalang, 170 SCRA 149, 162 [1989]). The intent to commit robbery must precede the taking of human life (People v. Luna, 58 SCRA 198, 208 [1974]). The records must show conclusively that the homicide was committed for the purpose of robbing the victim because a mere presumption of such fact is not sufficient to sustain a conviction for robo con homicidio. When a person is charged with robbery, the intent to rob must be proven. (See People v. Lanseta, 95 SCRA 166, 176 [1980]).


In the case at bar, the requisite criminal design was not duly proven. There was no showing of the appellant's intention, determined by his acts, prior to, contemporaneous with and subsequent to the commission of the crime, to commit robbery. (See People v. Guiapar, 129 SCRA 539, 553 [1984]) The appellant's actuation do not show his intention to commit robbery. The appellant was a friend of one of the victims, Ricardo Rivera. What started as a drinking spree among friends ended in a killing spree by the appellant. The appellant himself admitted that he was drunk and under the influence of drugs. That robbery was his purpose does not appear to be a logical deduction. It is more logical to infer that the taking of the wristwatches was just an afterthought by the appellant after he had killed his three victims. To constitute robbery with homicide, there should be a direct relation, an intimate connection between the robbery and the killing—whether the latter be prior or subsequent to the former, or whether both crimes were committed at the same time. (People v. Verdad, 122 SCRA 239, 244 [1983] citing People v. Hernandez, 46 Phil. 48 [1924]). In the case at bar, the direct relation or intimate connection between the robbery and the killing was not established.


We, therefore, follow the rule laid down in 
People v. Manalang, supra
, to wit:




We already had several occasions to hold that if the original design was not to commit robbery but that the idea of taking the personal property of another with intent to gain came to the mind of the offender after the homicide only as an afterthought or as a minor incident in the homicide, the criminal acts should be viewed as constituting two distinct offenses and not as a single complex crime; the crimes would be either homicide or murder, as the case may be, and theft. (People v. Atanacio, et al., No. L-11844, November 29, 1960, 110 Phil. 1032; People v. Elizaga, 86 Phil. 364 [1950]; People v. Glore, 87 Phil. 739 [1950])




Following this rule, the appellant is thus, convicted of three (3) separate crimes of homicide and another offense of theft. Notwithstanding that the information charged the appellant with robbery with multiple homicide, it is a well settled rule that when two or more offenses are charged in a single complaint or information, and the accused fails to object before trial, the Court may convict the accused of as many offenses as are charged and proved, and impose on him the penalty for each and every one of them, setting out the findings of fact and law in each case. (People v. Manalang, 
supra
) As the allegations in the information determine what offense is charged, the appellant may be convicted of each homicide as alleged and proved and of theft as alleged and proved. Each separate homicide and the crime of theft have been proved.


The aggravating circumstances of dwelling and abuse of confidence or obvious ungratefulness are appreciated in the killing of Ricardo Rivera. Ricardo Rivera was killed in his own home (See People v. Cuyo, G.R. No. 76211, April 30, 1991) by the appellant who was a guest of the deceased. (People v. Lobetania, 116 SCRA 297, 302, [1982]).


As to the circumstance of intoxication, there is no doubt that the appellant was drunk. This alternative circumstance cannot be considered mitigating as the appellant, aside from his self-serving testimony that he could not remember anything, has failed to prove that the liquor he drank impaired his mental faculties and that his drinking was not habitual or subsequent to the plan to commit the felony. (People v. Serenio, 179 SCRA 379, 383 [1989]) In fact, it should be considered as an aggravating circumstance since it was admitted by the appellant himself that he had been drinking liquor for a long time (TSN, March 2, 1988, p. 7) and he took part in at least 10 drinking sessions held in Ricardo Rivera's house (TSN, March 2, 1988, p. 5) He further stated that he tried to stop drinking liquor but he went back to his old habit. (TSN, March 2, 1988, p. 11) He was even drinking after this July 29, 1986 incident. (TSN, March 2, 1988, p. 12) Not only was the appellant drunk, but he testified that it was his habit to take prohibited drugs while drinking liquor. (TSN, March 2, 1988, p. 6) On the night in question, he admitted to have taken an estimate of 15 pieces of bluemax tablets and an undetermined amount of ""exponie"" tablets. (TSN, March 2, 1988, pp. 13-14)
