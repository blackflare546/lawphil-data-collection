REGALA, 
J.:


On February 28, 1961, Pedro de Guzman filed with the Court of Agrarian Relations a petition for the conversion of his tenancy relationship with Felicisima Manubay from the crop sharing system to the leasehold system. After the responsive pleadings to the said petition were filed, and the case was heard on the merits, the respondent Court authorized the change in the said relationship of the parties as prayed for by the petitioner. A motion for reconsideration of the said decision having been denied by the trial court, the respondent therein, Felicisima Manubay, went to this Court on appeal.


The appeal to this Court was submitted for decision on January 21, 1964. On July 28, 1965, however, the counsel for the appellant manifested that on May 3, 1965, the litigants had entered into an amicable settlement of the case under review. This Court was furnished a copy of the said agreement together with a motion for the resolution of the case at bar in accordance with the terms of the said document.


From the ""Malayang Pag-aayos"" entered into by the litigants herein, this Court finds that the terms of their agreement are as follows:




1. The landholder' petitioner-appellant, shall cancel and condone the indebtedness of the tenant, Pedro de Guzman, to her of 15 cavans and 17.5 kilos of palay;


2. The 43 cavans and 34 kilos of palay deposited with the P.L. Villaroman Bonded Warehouse shall be released iii favor of the landholder;


3. The respondent-appellee herein, Pedro de Guzman, shall return to the petitioner-appellant, Felicisima Manubay, the land subject of this controversy and the latter shall be free to hire her own tenant for the said land;


4. In consideration of the above, the petitioner-appellant herein, Felicisima Manubay, shall pay the respondent-appellee herein, Pedro de Guzman, P600.00, Philippine Currency;


5. The land in question shall be delivered to the petitioner-appellant herein, Felicisima Manubay, upon receipt by the respondent-appellee, Pedro de Guzman, of the above amount of P600.00. (As summarized and translated by this Court.)




Finding nothing in the above agreement to be contrary to any existing law or sound public policy, the above agreement, denominated by the parties hereto as ""Malayang Pag-aayos"" and dated May 3, 1965, is hereby approved and judgment is hereby rendered in this case in accordance with the terms thereof.
