REYES, J.B.L., 
J.:


Upon verification of the records in the Court of Appeals of the case subject of the present petition, entitled ""Victoria Hardware Company, plaintiff-appellee, versus Max Chamorro, et al., defendants-appellants"", CA-G.R. No. 30321-R, it has been found that judgment was rendered on 28 January 1964, affirming the decision of the trial court; that said decision became final and executory on 17 February 1964; and the records of the case had been remanded to the court of origin on 20 March 1964.


Considering that said final judgment was rendered in favor of the petitioner herein, it is evident that the instant petition for 
certiorari
 (complaining of allegedly excessive liberality of the Appeals Court in granting extensions to respondent Chamorro) has already become moot and academic.


WHEREFORE, this petition for 
certiorari
 is ordered dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs.
