REGALADO, 
J.:


This Court, in a resolution dated December 18, 1964, requested the parties to show cause why the petition in this case should not be dismissed for the reason that the strike of the Northwest Airlines Flight Engineers in the United States, which precipitated the action of the petitioners, had already been settled. The petitioner, in its manifestation, stated that the dispute of the International Association of Machinists, in behalf of the Flight Engineers of the Northwest Airlines, which gave rise to the labor dispute, had already been submitted to an arbitration board in America. The petitioner further admitted that the picketing in the strike of the Flight Engineers had therefore ceased.


However, the petitioner feels that the question to be decided is whether the term ""affiliation"" provided in Republic Act No. 875 in the interpretation of section 9 (d) therefor would be construed to mean an international affiliation, and this question should still be decided by the Supreme Court as a guide for future labor disputes. Hence, the petitioner wants this case to be decided in the interest of jurisprudence.


This Court, however, feels that the case has become moot and academic, hence, the petition is hereby dismissed. Without costs.
