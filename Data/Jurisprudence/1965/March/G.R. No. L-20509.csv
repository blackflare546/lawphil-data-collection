REYES, J.B.L., 
J.:


On November 17, 1964, this Court adopted in the above-entitled case a minute resolution couched as follows:




In L-20509, 
Lesme Baquilod, et al. vs. Hon. Marcelo Bobadilla, et al.,
 the record showing that the case involves an election protest originating in the elections held in November of 1959, for the positions of municipal councilors of Borongan, Samar; and it appearing that the terms for said positions expired with the year 1963, and that new elections have been held in November of said year, the Court RESOLVED to require the parties to show cause, within ten (10) days from receipt of a copy of this resolution, why this case should not be dismissed.




The period fixed in said resolution has lapsed without any action from either party. This inaction is proof that both parties acquiesce with the proposed action in the resolution previously quoted. Indeed, since new elections have been held in 1963, all questions relating to the election in 1959 automatically become academic.


WHEREFORE, the issues in this case having become moot, the same is hereby dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.
