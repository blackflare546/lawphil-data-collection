BARRERA, 
J.:


Charged, in an information filed on July 30, 1963 in the Court of First Instance of Manila, with the offense of damage to property through reckless imprudence, arising out of an accident that occurred on April 10, 1963, Jose Adolfo y Raymundo was found guilty and sentenced to pay to the offended party damages in the sum of P485.55, and a fine of P971.10, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. The accused appealed to the Court of Appeals, questioning, among others, the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Manila to pass upon the case, for the reason that, as it was alleged in the information that the amount of damage sustained by the offended party was P890.49, the maximum penalty imposable therefor, under Article 365, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code,
 1
 is only fine in an amount not more than three times the value of the damage or not more than P2,671.47. However, under paragraph (c) of Section 87 of the Judiciary Act,
 2
 as amended by Republic Act 3828 which took effect on June 22, 1963, offenses for which the penalty provided by law is a fine of not more than P3,000.00 fall within the original jurisdiction of the municipal court. It is thus contended that the trial court was without jurisdiction over the subject matter.


On his allegation, the Solicitor General tried to sustain the jurisdiction of the lower court by contending that the incident that gave rise to the suit occurred on April 10, 1963 whereas the amendatory provision invoked by appellant took effect only on June 22, 1963. As correctly commented on by the Court of Appeals, the jurisdiction of a court to try a criminal action is determined not by the law in force at the time of the commission of the offense, but by the law in force at the time of the institution of the action.
 3
 Consequently, as the maximum imposable penalty for the offense allegedly committed by appellant is a fine of three times the value of the damage to the property, or P2,671.47,
 4
 the case really is cognizable by the municipal court and not by the court of first instance.


IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision appealed from is hereby set aside, and the information filed therein is dismissed. Without costs. So ordered.
