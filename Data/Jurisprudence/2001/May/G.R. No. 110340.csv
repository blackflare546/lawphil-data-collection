The Facts




SLC was the owner of a 229-foot general cargo vessel, known as ""Dinky,"" which had an actual value of four million pesos (P4,000,000.00).
6


On February 14, 1983, SLC entered into a contract of services with WSSI for the conversion of ""Dinky"" into an LCT, to be known as ""Loadmaster"" which involved the lengthening of the ship to 268 feet, the extension of the vessel's moulded breath to 54 feet and moulded depth to 14 feet.
7


In accordance with the contract of services, SLC paid WSSI two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00).
8


On or about February 28, 1983, the vessel was docked at WSSI's shipyard.
9


Under the contract of services, completion and delivery to SLC of the renovated vessel shall be within one hundred thirty (130) calendar days from the docking of the vessel and WSSI had the obligation to pat demurrage to SLC in the amount of P10,000.00, a day for everyday of delay beyond the 130 calendar day period.
10


On January 30, 1986, SLC filed with the Regional Trial Court, Pasay City a complaint against WSSI for ""rescission of contract with damages and replevin.""
11
 SLC alleged that: 
First
, even after repeated demands, WSSI defaulted on its commitment to deliver the vessel to SLC after the stipulated period. 
Second
, WSSI violated the terms and conditions of the ""contract of services,"" with respect to the scope of work to be accomplished and the quality thereof. 
Third,
 the vessel has been in the continued possession of WSSI and has suffered deterioration due to exposure to the element; and 
Fourth
, due to the delay or demurrage incurred by WSSI, SLC has suffered unrealized profits the non-operation of the vessel at the minimum rate of four hundred thousand pesos (P400,000.00) a month.
12


Apparently there were two contracts for services, Annex ""A"" attached to SLC's complaint and Annex ""I"" attached to WSSI's answer. Doubt existed as to which of the two contracts was to be applied. A perusal of the two contracts of services show that they essentially have the same provisions except for the following, quoted verbatim:
