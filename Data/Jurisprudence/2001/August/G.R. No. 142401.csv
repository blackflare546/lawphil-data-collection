'That we, brother and sister, acknowledge the said amount as a just and valid obligation and therefore undertake to pay the same under the following terms which is in accordance with our present financial capacity;


'Within one (1) week from the date of this affidavit, we bind ourselves to pay WU SEN WOEI the amount of TWENTY THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS ($20,000.00) Cash;
