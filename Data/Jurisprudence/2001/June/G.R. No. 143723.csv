""As to the factual milieu, the contending parties have diametrically opposed versions. Vigan tells it this way; She was hired by the Litonjua Group of Companies on February 2, 1979 as telex operator. Later, she was assigned as accounting and payroll clerk under the supervision of Danilo Litonjua. She had been performing well until 1995, when Danilo Litonjua who was already naturally a (sic) very ill-tempered, ill-mouthed and violent employer, became more so due to business problems. In fact, a complaint letter (Annex ""I"", p. 85, rollo) was sent by the Litonjua Employees to the father and his junior regarding the boorishness of their kin Danilo Litonjua but apparently the management just glossed over this.

Danilo Litonjua became particularly angry with Vigan and threw a stapler at her when she refused to give him money upon the instructions of Eddie Litonjua. From then on, Danilo Litonjua had been rabid towards her – berated and bad-mouthed her, calling her a ""mental case"" ""psycho"", ""sira ulo"", etc. and even threatened to hit her for some petty matters. Danilo Litonjua even went so far as to lock her up in the comfort room and preventing others to help her out. Not contented, Danilo Litonjua would order the security guards to forcibly eject her or prevent her entry in the office premises whenever he was angry. This occurred twice in July of 1995, first on the 5th then on the 7th. The incidents prompted Vigan to write Danilo Litonjua letters asking why she was treated so and what was her fault (Annexes ""F"", ""G"" & ""K"", pp. 82, 83 & 87, rollo). She suspected that Danilo Litonjua wanted her out for he would not let her inside the office such that even while abroad he would order the guards by phone to bar her. She pleaded for forgiveness or at least for explanation but it fell on deaf ears.


Later, Danilo Litonjua changed tack and charged that Vigan had been hysterical, emotional and created scenes at the office. He even required her to secure psychiatric assistance. (Annexes ""L"" to ""N"", pp. 88-90, rollo) But despite proof that she was not suffering from psychosis or organic brain syndrome as certified to by a Psychiatrist of Danilo Litonjua’s choice (Annex ""H"", p. 84, rollo), still she was denied by the guards entry to her work upon instructions again of Danilo Litonjua. Left with no alternative, Vigan filed this case for illegal dismissal, alleging she was receiving a monthly salary of P8,000.00 at the time she was unlawfully terminated.


The Litonjuas have a different version. They negate the existence of the Litonjua Group of Companies and the connection of Eduardo Litonjua thereto. They contend that Vigan was employed by ACT Theater, Inc., where Danilo Litonjua is a Director. They dispute the charge of illegal dismissal for it was Vigan who ceased to report for work despite notices and likewise contest the P8,000.00 monthly salary alleged by Vigan, claiming it was merely P6,850.00.


They claim that Vigan was a habitual absentee specially on Tuesdays that fell within three days before and after the ""15th"" day and ""30th"" day of every month. Her performance had been satisfactory, but then starting March 15, 1996 she had become emotional, hysterical, uncontrollable and created disturbances at the office with her crying and shouting for no reason at all. The incident was repeated on April 3, 1996, May 24, 1996 and on June 4, 1996. Thus alarmed, on July 24, 1996 Vigan was required by management to undergo medical and psychological examination at the company’s expense and naming three doctors to attend to her. Dr. Baltazar Reyes and Dr. Tony Perlas of the Philippine General Hospital and Dr. Lourdes Ignacio of the Medical Center Manila. But they claim that Vigan refused to comply.


On August 2, 1996, Vigan again had another breakdown, hysterical, shouting and crying as usual for about an hour, and then she just left the premises without a word. The next day, August 3, 1996, Saturday, she came to the office and explained she was not feeling well the day before. After that Vigan went AWOL and did not heed telegram notices from her employer made on August 26, 1996 and on September 9, 1996 (Annexes ""1"" & ""2"", pp. 108 to 109, rollo). She instead filed the instant suit for illegal dismissal.""




On June 10, 1997, Labor Arbiter Ernesto S. Dinopol rendered his decision

 finding Vigan diseased and unfit for work under Article 284 of the Labor Code

 and awarded the corresponding separation pay as follows:
