vs.


HECTOR MARIANO y TENGCO,
 accused-appellant. 


PARDO, 
J.:


The case is an appeal from the decision
1
 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 276, Muntinlupa City finding accused Hector Mariano y Tengco guilty beyond reasonable doubt of possession of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu),
2
 a regulated drug, and sentencing him to life imprisonment.


On September 21, 1995, Senior State Prosecutor Theodore M. Villanueva filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 276, Muntinlupa City an Information
3
 charging accused with violation of Section 16, Article III, R. A. No. 6425, as amended, to wit:




""That on or about August 10, 1995 in the City of Muntinlupa and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court above-named accused did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly have in his possession, custody and control three hundred forty two and point four (342.4) grams more or less of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu), a regulated drug, without any prescription, authority, permit or license from the government to have and possess such regulated drug.


""CONTRARY TO LAW.""




On November 9, 1995, upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty.
4
 Forthwith, trial ensued.


On August 3, 1995, P/Sr. Insp. Joselito M. Daniel received an information that a certain Oscar G. Sanga, or ""Oca"" was engaged in the illegal traffic of dangerous drugs. P/Sr. Insp. Daniel relayed the information to P/Chief Inspector Joel D. Pagdilao, who ordered the formation of a buy-bust team to be headed by P/Sr. Insp. Daniel.
5
 


P/Sr. Insp. Daniel and the confidential informant proceeded to the house of Oscar Sanga. P/Sr. Insp. Daniel presented himself as a buyer of shabu, and that he was buying three (3) kilos. Oscar Sanga quoted the price at P950,000.00 per kilo. They agreed that the sale would take place at the house of the confidential informant in Mintcor Subdivision, Alabang in the morning of August 8, 1995.
6
 


After two failed attempts, the sale finally took place in the early morning of August 10, 1995. Oscar Sanga arrived past 12:00 midnight on board a green KIA Pride with Plate No. TLK-560. His driver remained inside the car, while Oscar Sanga and P/Sr. Insp. Daniel proceeded to the garage. Oscar Sanga asked P/Sr. Insp. Daniel if he had the money, and when he answered in the affirmative, Oscar Sanga went to the KIA Pride car and took out a black and white Felix the Cat pillowcase from the back seat. He tore the pillowcase open and removed two plastic bags containing some white crystalline substance. At this point, P/Sr. Insp. Daniel beeped his Voyager, a two-way radio transmitter, as a pre-arranged signal to the other members of the team who were strategically positioned within the vicinity.
7
 


The team immediately rushed to the garage. P/Sr. Insp. Daniel and PO2 Francisco T. Duran apprehended Oscar Sanga, while SPO2 Ruben T. Manibo checked on the driver of the KIA Pride car, later identified as accused Hector Mariano y Tengco. SPO2 Manibo confiscated a black belt bag from accused Mariano. The bag contained five (5) small plastic bags of shabu with a total weight of more or less 342.4 grams. SPO2 Manibo arrested accused Mariano.
8
 Separate charges were filed against accused Sanga and Mariano.


However, on November 29, 1995, before SPO2 Manibo could testify, he was killed while conducting another buy-bust operation.
9
 The prosecution was constrained to present the testimonies of P/Sr. Insp. Daniel and PO2 Duran against accused Mariano.


P/Sr. Insp. Daniel testified that SPO2 Ruben Manibo apprehended accused Mariano. He had no participation in the frisking of accused Mariano and has no knowledge whether the 342.4 grams of shabu were actually found in accused Mariano’s possession.
10
 


PO2 Duran testified that he assisted P/Sr. Insp. Daniel in apprehending Oscar Sanga. He claimed that, at the same time, SPO2 Manibo conducted a search on accused Mariano. SPO2 Manibo recovered five small pieces of plastic from the black belt bag which accused Mariano was then wearing.
11
 While testifying in the court 
a quo
, a black belt bag
12
 was shown to PO2 Duran and he identified the same as the bag worn by accused Mariano.
13
 During the cross-examination, accused Mariano’s counsel asked accused to wear the belt bag, but the same did not fit his waistline.
14
 


The prosecution dispensed with the testimony of the forensic chemist, Julieta C. Flores. Her qualification as an expert witness, the purpose of her testimony and her laboratory reports were the subject of a stipulation of facts.
15
 


After the prosecution rested its case, the defense filed a demurrer to evidence, but the trial court by resolution dated November 27, 1997, denied the demurrer.
16
 On December 16, 1997, accused Mariano filed a motion for reconsideration, but the trial court likewise denied the same.
17
 


In the meantime, accused Mariano jumped bail prior to the filing of the motion for reconsideration. However, the bondsman subsequently surrendered him to the court on February 23, 1998.
18
 


On April 28, 1999, the trial court rendered a judgment
19
 
sans
 defense evidence, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:




""PREMISES considered, for Possession of Methamphetamine Hydrocholoride in the quantity of 342.4 grams, Hector Mariano is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, and is sentenced to suffer life imprisonment. He should therefore be committed to the New Bilibid Prison where he may serve his sentence.


""It is SO ORDERED.


""Muntinlupa City, April 16, 1998.
