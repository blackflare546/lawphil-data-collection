JAIME T. TORRES,

vs.


HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL and NINFA GARIN, 
respondents. 


GONZAGA-REYES, 
J.:


Assailed in this special civil action for 
certiorari 
is the July 13, 2000 Resolution
1
 of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal dismissing the election protest of herein petitioner Jaime T. Torres in HRET Case No.98-017; and the August 3, 2000 Resolution thereof denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration. Petitioner Torres questioned the election of private respondent Ninfa S. Garin as Member of the House of Representatives representing the First Legislative District of Iloilo.


Petitioner Jaime T. Torres and private respondent Ninfa S. Garin were among the candidates for the said Congressional seat in the May 11, 1998 elections. On May 17, 1998, upon canvassing the votes cast, the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Iloilo proclaimed the private respondent as the winner, with Sixty Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty One (60,851) votes, over petitioner's Fifty Nine Thousand Four Hundred Forty Seven (59,447) votes, or a margin of One Thousand Four Hundred Four (1,404) votes.


Petitioner seasonably filed an election protest before the Tribunal questioning the results of the elections in all the precincts of the seven (7) municipalities of the First Legislative District of Iloilo.
2
 He claimed, in essence, that a number of votes cast in his favor were invalidated and not counted, while a number of invalid votes were counted in private respondent's favor.


In her Answer with Counter Protest, private respondent denied the allegations in the protest. She counter-protested the results of the elections in all the 158 precincts of Miag-ao and 126 precincts of Tigbauan. She claimed that it was petitioner who had committed various election frauds, anomalies and irregularities particularly in the precincts of Miag-ao and Tigbauan.


In the preliminary conference held on August 6, 1998, the parties agreed and stipulated, among other things, that the issues involved are: (1) revision, recount and appreciation of ballots; and (2) election irregularities, fraud, etc. as alleged in the counter-protest. The parties likewise designated their respective pilot precincts in accordance with Rule 68 of the 1998 House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal Rules - 185 for the petitioner and 67 for the private respondent, 15 of which were commonly protested or a total of 237 precincts.
3
 During revision, however, a total of 5 precincts were deducted from the original lists of pilot precincts submitted by the parties. It turned out that there were only 232 ballot boxes belonging to the pilot precincts - 182 for the petitioner and 65 for the private respondent, 15 of which were commonly protested.
4


Based on the Election Returns (ERs), Tally Boards (TBs) (when ERs are missing or unreadable), or from the Statement of Votes (SOVs) (when both ER and TB are not available), the respective votes of the parties, prior to revision, were 
17.023 
for the petitioner and 
22.087 
for the private respondent in the pilot protested and counter-protested precinct’s, broken down as follows:
