PRODUCERS BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES,

vs.


NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION and PRODUCERS BANK EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION,
1
 respondents.


GONZAGA-REYES, 
J.
:


Before us is a special civil action for certiorari with prayer for preliminary injunction and/or restraining order seeking the nullification of (1) the decision of public respondent in NLRC-NCR Case No. 02-00753-88, entitled ""Producers Bank Employees Association v. Producers Bank of the Philippines,"" promulgated on 30 April 1991, reversing the Labor Arbiter's dismissal of private respondent's complaint and (2) public respondent's resolution dated 18 June 1991 denying petitioner's motion for partial reconsideration.
1âwphi1.nêt
 


The present petition originated from a complaint filed by private respondent on 11 February 1988 with the Arbitration Branch, National Capital Region, National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), charging petitioner with diminution of benefits, non-compliance with Wage Order No. 6 and non-payment of holiday pay. In addition, private respondent prayed for damages.
2
 


On 31 March 1989, Labor Arbiter Nieves V. de Castro found private respondent's claims to be unmeritorious and dismissed its complaint.
3
 In a complete reversal, however, the NLRC
4
 granted all of private respondent's claims, except for damages.
5
 The dispositive portion of the NLRC's decision provides – 




WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed Decision is, as it is hereby, SET ASIDE and another one issued ordering respondent- appellee to pay complainant-appellant: 


1. The unpaid bonus (mid-year and Christmas bonus) and 13
th
 month pay;


2. Wage differentials under Wage Order No. 6 for November 1, 1984 and the corresponding adjustment thereof; and 


3. Holiday pay under Article 94 of the Labor Code, but not to exceed three (3) years. 


The rest of the claims are dismissed for lack of merit. 


SO ORDERED. 




Petition filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration, which was denied by the NLRC in a Resolution issued on 18 June 1991. Hence, recourse to this Court.


Petitioner contends that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in ruling as it did for the succeeding reasons stated in its Petition - 


1. On the alleged diminution of benefits, the NLRC gravely abused its discretion when (1) it contravened the Supreme Court decision in Traders Royal Bank v. NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 88168, promulgated on August 30, 1990, (2) its ruling is not justified by law and Art. 100 of the Labor Code, (3) its ruling is contrary to the CBA, and (4) the so-called ""company practice invoked by it has no legal and moral bases"" (p. 2, Motion for Partial Reconsideration, Annex ""H"");


2. On the alleged non-compliance with Wage Order No. 6, the NLRC again gravely abused its discretion when it patently and palpably erred in holding that it is ""more inclined to adopt the stance of appellant (private respondent UNION) in this issue since it is more in keeping with the law and its implementing provisions and the intendment of the parties as revealed in their CBA"" without giving any reason or justification for such conclusions as the stance of appellant (private respondent UNION) does not traverse the clear and correct finding and conclusion of the Labor Arbiter.


Furthermore, the petitioner, under 
conservatorship
 and 
distressed
, is exempted under Wage Order No. 6.


Finally, the ""wage differentials under Wage Order No. 6 for November 1, 1984 and the corresponding adjustment thereof"" (par. 2, dispositive portion, NLRC Decision), has prescribed (p. 12, Motion for Partial Reconsideration, Annex ""H"").


3. On the alleged non-payment of legal holiday pay, the NLRC again gravely abused its discretion when it patently and palpably erred in approving and adopting ""the position of appellant (private respondent UNION)"" without giving any reason or justification therefor which position does not squarely traverse or refute the Labor Arbiter's correct finding and ruling (p. 18, Motion for Partial Reconsideration, Annex ""H"").
6
 


On 29 July 1991, the Court granted petitioner's prayer for a temporary restraining order enjoining respondents from executing the 30 April 1991 Decision and 18 June 1991 Resolution of the NLRC.
7


Coming now to the merits of the petition, the Court shall discuss the issues 
ad seriatim.


Bonuses


As to the bonuses, private respondent declared in its position papers filed with the NLRC that –


1. Producers Bank of the Philippines, a banking institution, has been providing several benefits to its employees since 1971 when it started its operation. Among the benefits it had been regularly giving is a mid-year bonus equivalent to an employee's one-month basic pay and a Christmas bonus equivalent to an employee's one whole month salary (basic pay plus allowance);


2. When P.D. 851, the law granting a 13
th
 month pay, took effect, the basic pay previously being given as part of the Christmas bonus was applied as compliance to it (P.D. 851), the allowances remained as Christmas bonus;


3. From 1981 up to 1983, the bank continued giving one month basic pay as mid-year bonus, one month basic pay as 13
th
 month pay but the Christmas bonus was no longer based on the allowance but on the basic pay of the employees which is higher;


4. In the early part of 1984, the bank was placed under conservatorship but it still provided the traditional mid-year bonus;


5. By virtue of an alleged Monetary Board Resolution No. 1566, bank only gave a one-half (1/2) month basic pay as compliance of the 13
th
 month pay and none for the Christmas bonus. In a tabular form, here are the bank's violations:

Private respondent argues that the mid-year and Christmas bonuses, by reason of their having been given for thirteen consecutive years, have ripened into a vested right and, as such, can no longer be unilaterally withdrawn by petitioner without violating Article 100 of Presidential Decree No. 4429 which prohibits the diminution or elimination of benefits already being enjoyed by the employees. Although private respondent concedes that the grant of a bonus is discretionary on the part of the employer, it argues that, by reason of its long and regular concession, it may become part of the employee's regular compensation.
10


On the other hand, petitioner asserts that it cannot be compelled to pay the alleged bonus differentials due to its depressed financial condition, as evidenced by the fact that in 1984 it was placed under conservatorship by the Monetary Board. According to petitioner, it sustained losses in the millions of pesos from 1984 to 1988, an assertion which was affirmed by the labor arbiter. Moreover, petitioner points out that the collective bargaining agreement of the parties does not provide for the payment of any mid-year or Christmas bonus. On the contrary, section 4 of the collective bargaining agreement states that –




Acts of Grace
. Any other benefits or privileges which are not expressly provided in this Agreement, even if now accorded or hereafter accorded to the employees, shall be deemed purely acts of grace dependent upon the sole judgment and discretion of the BANK to grant, modify or withdraw .
11




A bonus is an amount granted and paid to an employee for his industry and loyalty which contributed to the success of the employer's business and made possible the realization of profits. It is an act of generosity granted by an enlightened employer to spur the employee to greater efforts for the success of the business and realization of bigger profits.
12
 The granting of a bonus is a management prerogative, something given in addition to what is ordinarily received by or strictly due the recipient.
13
 Thus, a bonus is not a demandable and enforceable obligation,
14
 except when it is made part of the wage, salary or compensation of the employee.
15


However, an employer cannot be forced to distribute bonuses which it can no longer afford to pay. To hold otherwise would be to penalize the employer for his past generosity. Thus, in 
Traders Royal Bank v. NLRC
,
16
 
we held that - 




It is clear x x x that the petitioner may not be obliged to pay bonuses to its employees. The matter of giving them bonuses over and above their lawful salaries and allowances is entirely dependent on the profits, if any, realized by the Bank from its operations during the past year.


From 1979-1985, the bonuses were less because the income of the Bank had decreased. In 1986, the income of the Bank was only 20.2 million pesos, but the Bank still gave out the usual two (2) months basic mid-year and two months gross year-end bonuses. The petitioner pointed out, however, that the Bank weakened considerably after 1986 on account of political developments in the country. Suspected to be a Marcos-owned or controlled bank, it was placed under sequestration by the present administration and is now managed by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). 


In light of these submissions of the petitioner, the contention of the Union that the granting of bonuses to the employees had ripened into a company practice that may not be adjusted to the prevailing financial condition of the Bank has no legal and moral bases. Its fiscal condition having declined, the Bank may not be forced to distribute bonuses which it can no longer afford to pay and, in effect, be penalized for its past generosity to its employees. - 


Private respondent's contention, that the decrease in the mid-year and year-end bonuses constituted a diminution of the employees' salaries, is not correct, for bonuses are not part of labor standards in the same class as salaries, cost of living allowances, holiday pay, and leave benefits, which are provided by the Labor Code.




This doctrine was reiterated in the more recent case of 
Manila Banking Corporation v. NLR
17
 
wherein the Court made the following pronouncements –




By definition, a ""bonus"" is a gratuity or act of liberality of the giver which the recipient has no right to demand as a matter of right. It is something given in addition to what is ordinarily received by or strictly due the recipient. The granting of a bonus is basically a management prerogative which cannot be forced upon the employer who may not be obliged to assume the onerous burden of granting bonuses or other benefits aside from the employee's basic salaries or wages, especially so if it is incapable of doing so.

Clearly then, a bonus is an amount given 
ex gratia 
to an employee by an employer on account of success in business or realization of profits. How then can an employer be made liable to pay additional benefits in the nature of bonuses to its employees when it has been operating on considerable net losses for a given period of time? 


Records bear out that petitioner Manilabank was already in dire financial straits in the mid-80's. As early as 1984, the Central Bank found that Manila bank had been suffering financial losses. Presumably, the problems commenced even before their discovery in 1984. As earlier chronicled, the Central Bank placed petitioner bank under comptrollership in 1984 because of liquidity problems and excessive interbank borrowings. In 1987, it was placed under receivership and ordered to close operation. In 1988, it was ordered liquidated. 


It is evident, therefore, that petitioner bank was operating on net losses from the years 1984, 1985 and 1986, thus, resulting to its eventual closure in 1987 and liquidation in 1988. Clearly, there was no success in business or realization of profits to speak of that would warrant the conferment of additional benefits sought by private respondents. No company should be compelled to act liberally and confer upon its employees additional benefits over and above those mandated by law when it is plagued by economic difficulties and financial losses. No act of enlightened generosity and self-interest can be exacted from near empty , if not empty coffers.




It was established by the labor arbiter
18
 and the NLRC
19
 and admitted by both parties
20
 that petitioner was placed under conservatorship by the Monetary Board, pursuant to its authority under Section 28-A of Republic Act No. 265,
21
 as amended by Presidential Decree No. 72,
22
 which provides – 




Sec.28-A. Appointment of conservator. - Whenever, on the basis of a report submitted by the appropriate supervising and examining department, the Monetary Board finds that a bank is in a state of continuing inability or unwillingness to maintain a condition of solvency and liquidity deemed adequate to protect the interest of depositors and creditors, the Monetary Board may appoint a conservator to take charge of the assets, liabilities, and the management of that banking institution, collect all monies and debts due said bank and exercise all powers necessary to preserve the assets of the bank, reorganize the management thereof and restore its viability .He shall have the power to overrule or revoke ""the actions of the previous management and board of directors of the bank, any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, and such other powers as the Monetary Board shall deem necessary.
1âwphi1.nêt

Under Section 28-A, the Monetary Board may place a bank under the control of a conservator when it finds that the bank is continuously unable or unwilling to maintain a condition of solvency or liquidity .In 
Central Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals
,
23
 
the Court declared that the order placing petitioner herein under conservatorship had long become final and its validity could no longer be litigated upon. Also, in the same case, the Court found that sometime in August, 1983, some news items triggered a bank-run in petitioner which resulted in continuous over- drawings on petitioner's demand deposit account with the Central Bank; the over- drawings reached P143.955 million by 17 January 1984; and as of 13 February 1990, petitioner had over-drawings of up to P1.233 billion, which evidences petitioner's continuing inability to maintain a condition of solvency and liquidity, thus justifying the conservatorship. Our findings in the 
Central Bank 
case coincide with petitioner's claims that it continuously suffered losses from 1984 to 1988 as follows –






YEAR




NET LOSSES IN MILLIONS OF PESOS






1984




P 144.418






1985




P 144.940






1986




P 132.940






1987




P 84.182






January-February 1988




P 9.271








These losses do not include the interest expenses on the overdraft loan of the petitioner to the Central Bank, which interest as of July 31, 1987, amounted to P610.065 Million, and penalties on reserve deficiencies which amounted to P89.029 Million. The principal balance of the overdraft amounted to P971.632 Million as of March 16, 1988.
24
 


Petitioner was not only experiencing a decline in its profits, but was reeling from tremendous losses triggered by a bank-run which began in 1983. In such a depressed financial condition, petitioner cannot be legally compelled to continue paying the same amount of bonuses to its employees. Thus, the conservator was justified in reducing the mid-year and Christmas bonuses of petitioner's employees. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the reason for the conservatorship which is to preserve the assets and restore the viability of the financially precarious bank. Ultimately, it is to the employees' advantage that the conservatorship achieve its purposes for the alternative would be petitioner's closure whereby employees would lose not only their benefits, but their jobs as well.


13
th
 Month Pay


With regard to the 13
th
 month pay, the NLRC adopted the position taken by private respondent and held that the conservator was not justified in diminishing or not paying the 13
th
 month pay and that petitioner should have instead applied for an exemption, in accordance with section 7 of Presidential Decree No. 851 (PD 851), as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1364, but that it did not do so.
25
 The NLRC held that the actions of the conservator ran counter to the provisions of PD 851. 


In its position paper,
26
 private respondent claimed that petitioner made the following payments to its members –
