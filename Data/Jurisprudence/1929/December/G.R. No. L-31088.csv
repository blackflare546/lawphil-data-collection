ROMUALDEZ, 
J.:


This action is for the recovery from the defendant of the sum of P56,246 which he, according to the complaint, collected from the plaintiff in excess of what he should have collected by way of income tax, in accordance with the declaration presented for that purpose. 


PROCEEDINGS


To the complaint filed with the trial court on July 9, 1928, the defendant interposed his answer which was subsequently amended, denying generally and specifically the allegations of the complaint, setting up a special defense and praying that he be absolved from the complaint. 


On September 13, 1928, the parties presented a stipulation of facts upon which they submitted the case to the court for decision, which was decided and the defendant absolved from the complaint with costs against the plaintiff. 


The latter appealed from said judgment, and the case is before us upon the respective briefs of both parties.

VI.

""DON MIGUEL J. OSSORIO

Taxpayer's name.

Yangco, which were adjudicated to her as a testate inheritance in a partition approved by a judicial order dated March 12, 1909, entered in the estate proceedings No. 5853 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, which partition appears not only in the aforesaid estate proceeding but also in the register of deeds for the City of Manila, where a certified copy thereof was filed a few days after order approving the same was entered.

VI.	That in the foregoing assessment notice, Exhibit B, of this complaint, the defendant assessed the plaintiff alone the additional tax upon the sum total of the income accruing to the plaintiff and his wife, according to the declarations referred to in paragraph V of this complaint. (Pages 48 to 49, Bill of Exceptions.) 




QUESTIONS RAISED 


The basic point of discussion between the parties is whether the paraphernal property of the plaintiff's wife constitutes her ""separate estate"" within the scope and meaning of this phrase for the purpose of the additional income tax, so that she is entitled to file a separate declaration, and to have the additional tax on the income from her paraphernal property separately assessed. 


There is no dispute between the parties as to whether the property in question is paraphernal property. In fact it is paraphernal, because the plaintiff's wife acquired it by inheritance. (Art. 1381, Civil Code; Alvaran vs. Marquez, 11 Phil., 263.) 


As the rules governing the income tax in the Philippines are derived from North America, it is necessary to determine whether or not the ""paraphernal property"" under our Civil Code is the so-called ""separate estate"" of North American law and jurisprudence. 


In our opinion the paraphernal constitute the property designated in the United States law and jurisprudence, ""statutory separate estate"" as distinguished from the ""equitable separate estate"" which is a creation of the English Common Law, not in force in the Philippines, because our law on the matter has been derived from Spain, and through Spain from the Roman Law. This is one definition of the wife's separate estate"": 


""A wife's separate estate is that from which the dominion and control of the husband is excluded, and from which he is to derive no benefit by reason of the marital relation. It may be equitable or statutory, according to the mode of its creation,"" and notes (30 Corpus Juris, 795). 


We are convinced that what we consider ""paraphernal property"" is equivalent to the ""statutory separate estate"" of North American law, of which one definition is made in the decision appealed from and cited in the brief of the Attorney-General, to wit: 




Both in England and in this country statutes have been enacted which usually provide that the real and personal property of any married woman which she may have at the time of marriage, or which she may thereafter acquire, shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband, nor liable for his debt, but shall continue her sole and separate property as if she were a feme sole. (13 R. C. L., 1147, sec. 170.) (Pages 7 and 8, Attorney-General's brief.) 




According to the Civil Code in force in the Philippines, by paraphernal property is meant that which the wife brings to the marriage without including it in the dowry, and that which she later acquires without adding it thereto. The wife retains the ownership over such property; the husband cannot exercise any action of any sort with respect to such property without the intervention or consent of his wife, who has the management of said property, unless she has made it over to him before a notary in order that he may administer it, in which case the husband is bound to give a mortgage for the value of the personal property received by him, or to give security therefor in the manner provided for in dowered estate. The husband's personal obligation shall not be collected from the income of the paraphernal property, unless it be proved that they have been for the benefit of the family. (Arts. 1381, 1382, 1384, and 1386 of the Civil Code.) 


It should be noted that both with respect to the ""paraphernal property,"" and to the ""statutory separate estate,"" the ownership thereof belongs to the wife exclusively, and the income is not at the husband's disposal, nor is she responsible for his personal obligations. 


The following citation from Ruling Case Law is invoked in support of the contention that ""separate estate"" is not the same as paraphernal property: 




Under the several statutory and constitutional provisions the rents, profits, increase and income of the wife's separate property are generally her separate property as fully as the corpus of the property itself, and it is not material that such profits are produced by the skill and labor of the woman in the use and management of her separate property, while living with her husband. (13 R.C.L., 1151, sec. 175.) (Page 8, Attorney-General's brief), to show that the ""separate estate"" differs from the ""paraphernal property"" are a part of the conjugal property (art. 1385). 




But it must be observed that the citation from the Ruling Case Law quoted above start out by saying: ""Under the several statutory and constitutional provisions,"" and it does not state that such is the prevailing rule in 
all 
of the North American States. The truth is, as everybody knows, that some of the North American States are governed by laws of Roman origin, brought thither through Spanish and French legislation. Thus the conjugal property system prevails in Texas, Arizona, California, Washington, Louisiana, and New Mexico (T. D. 3071, ""Cumulative Bulletin"" No. 3, page 221). 


The fact that under the law the income from the paraphernal property passes to the conjugal property does not prevent it from being income derived from the wife's separate estate, and taxable as such. It must not be lost sight of that the income tax shall be collected at the source, ""collection at the source."" (Income Tax, Black, 4th edition, pages 245 
et seq
.) 


When the wife's income passes to the marriage property, 
it is not added as income from the conjugal property
, but as a part of the funds or capital of said property. The income tax cannot be assessed against it as though it were conjugal property income, because it is not; neither can it be assessed as a tax on the husband's income, because it is not his income. If the income from the paraphernal property is to be taxed as income of any other person or entity. Otherwise, the income from the paraphernal property could not be subject to the income tax; such a tax could not be assessed against the wife because it forms a part of the conjugal property; and it could not be assessed against the conjugal partnership because it is not the income of said partnership. 


The court being of the opinion that the paraphernal property is the equivalent of the North American so-called ""wife's separate estate,"" and that the income therefrom is taxable as the wife's income, and not as a part of the
 funds 
(not 
income
) of the conjugal partnership, we see no reason for not applying to the instant case the resolution of the Unites States Department of the Treasury passed upon a case that originated in the Philippines, and therefore, arrived at after a consideration of our laws on conjugal property and those on separate property of husband and wife, quoted with approval in the case of 
Madrigal and Paterno vs. Rafferty and Concepcion 
(38 Phil., 414), as follows: 




The only occasion for a wife making a return is where she has income from a sole and separate estate in excess of $3,000, or where the husband and wife neither separately have an income of $3,000, but together they have an income in excess of $4,000, in which latter event either the husband or wife may make the return but not both. In all instances the income of husband and wife whether from separate estates or not, is taken as a whole for the purpose of the normal tax. Where the wife has income from a separate estate and makes return thereof, or where her income is separately shown in the return made by her husband, while the income are added together for the purpose of the normal tax they are taken separately for the purpose of the additional 

tax. . . . 




Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and it is ordered that the defendant make two separate assessment of the additional income tax, one against the plaintiff, and the other against his wife on her paraphernal property, returning the sum of P56,203.59 to said plaintiff, without prejudice to his levying against and collecting from said plaintiff's wife upon her own separate individual declaration, in accordance with law, the additional income tax for the income from her paraphernal property. 


Judgment without express award of costs.
