 plaintiffs-appellees,

vs.


JUAN N. EVANGELISTA,
 defendant-appellant.


Provincial Fiscal Santos for appellant.

Gonzalez and Virola for appellees.


VILLA-REAL, 
J.:


The defendant, Juan N. Evangelista, appeals to this court from the judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, the disposition part of which reads as follows:




Wherefore, the court is of the opinion and so holds that the preliminary injunction issued in this case should be declared permanent, and furthermore orders the defendant herein to indemnify the plaintiffs in the sum of one hundred pesos (P100) for every day of the ordinary cockpit days, and five hundred pesos (P500) for every day of extraordinary ones permitted by the law, during which the operation of the cockpit in question was suspended by order of the said defendant, with the costs him. So ordered.




In support of his appeal, the appellant assigns the following alleged errors as committed by the court 
a quo
 in its decision, to wit:




1.	The lower court erred in declaring that the plaintiff-appellee Antonio Abad had obtained due permit from the defendant to transfer to, establish and operate his cockpit at the barrio of San Nicolas, Municipality of Gapan, Province of Nueva Ecija.


2.	The lower court erred in holding that ordinance No. 8, series of 1932, duly passed and approved by the municipal council of Gapan, Province of Nueva Ecija, is null and void because it is partial.


3.	The lower court erred in sentencing the defendant, a public officer, being the municipal president of Gapan, Nueva Ecija, to indemnify the plaintiffs in the sum of P100 for every of the ordinary cockpit days and P500 for every day of extraordinary ones during the days the plaintiffs' cockpit was suspended from operation by the defendant.




The pertinent facts necessary for the resolution of the questions raised in the present appeal are as follows:


Desiring to transfer his cockfighting business together with the cockpit from the barrio of San Lorenzo to that of San Nicolas, both in the municipality of Gapan, Nueva Ecija, Antonio Abad, one of the plaintiff-appellees herein, sought an interview with the president of the aforesaid municipality, the herein defendant-appellant Juan N. Evangelista, regarding the matter. Acting upon the latter's suggestion, Antonio Abad addressed him the following communication (Exhibit A) on February 9, 1932:




The undersigned hereby applies for a permit to transfer to and to reconstruct his 
camarin
 of wood with iron roof, measuring 30 x 15 meters, on the land belonging to Mr. Agustin Garcia in the barrio of San Nicolas in this municipality. This 
camarin
 will be used as a cockpit, and is already assessed for tax purposes under Tax Declaration No. 20522 in the name of the herein applicant.


Trusting that you will give this application prompt attention and due consideration, I remain.






Very respectfully yours,

(Sgd.) ANTONIO ABAD"
