Acting Attorney-General Zaragoza for appellee.


CARSON, 
J.:


An appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance, Fourth Judicial District, convicting the appellants of
 
a violation of a gambling ordinance of the city of Baguio, rendered on appeal from the court of the justice of the peace of that city.


The right of the appellants to maintain this appeal turns
 
upon our ruling as to the question raised by them as to
 
the validity of the ordinance of the violation of which they
 
were convicted. (U.S. 
vs.
 Tamparong, p. 321, 
ante.
)


Counsel for appellants contend that the municipal council of the city of Baguio is not clothed with power to enact an ordinance defining, prohibiting and penalizing gambling by its charter (Act No. 1963), from which, as counsel
 
properly contend, all lawful powers exercised by the council must be derived.


The trial judge was of opinion that the power to enact
 
the ordinance in question was secured to the city council
 
of Baguio under subsection 
(e)
 of section 32 of the Baguio Incorporation Act (No. 1963), which provides that ""all laws
 
or parts of laws of the Philippine Islands which, prior to
 
the passage of this Act, were applicable to the territory
 
comprising the city of Baguio and which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act shall remain in full
 
force and effect."" The trial judge was of opinion that since the provisions of section 29 of Act No. 1397 (The
 
Township Government Act) confer in express terms
 
authority upon township councils organized under that Act
 
in the Province of Benguet to ""prohibit gambling, opium smoking, or the sale of opium for smoking,"" the power
 
with which township councils under that Act are thus
 
expressly clothed should be held to be conferred upon the
 
municipal council of the city of Baguio.


We are of opinion, however, that since the express powers
 
conferred in section 29 of the Township Government Act
 
(No. 1397) are conferred only upon townships organized
 
under the provisions of that Act, those powers cannot
 
properly be held to have been conferred upon the municipal
 
council of the city of Baguio, which was incorporated under
 
the provisions of the Baguio Incorporation Act, and not
 
under the provisions of the Township Government Act (No. 1397). It is true, as indicated in the opinion of the
 
trial judge, that the provisions of Act No. 1397 are ""parts
 
of laws of the Philippine Islands which,"" prior to the
 
passage of the Baguio Incorporation Act, were applicable to
 
the ""territory comprising the city of Baguio,"" but it will be
 
observed that they are applicable thereto only in the event
 
of the organization in that territory of a township under
 
and by virtue of the Township Government Act (No. 1397).


We think, however, that the validity of the ordinance under discussion and the power of the city council of Baguio to enact it must be sustained under the provisions of
 
subsection 
(gg)
 of section 8 of the Baguio Incorporation Act (No. 1963), as amended by section 2 of Act No. 2106, in
 
which the title of the subsection is changed to subsection 
(ll)
 of section 8 of Act No. 1963. the provisions of that
 
section are as follows (section 8, subsection 
(ll)
, Act No .1963, as amended):




The city council shall have power by ordinance or
 
resolution
 — 


(c)	
To make such further ordinances and regulations
 
not repugnant to law as may be necessary to carry into
 
effect and discharge the powers and duties conferred by
 
this charter and such as shall seem necessary and proper to provide for the health and safety, promote the prosperity, improve the morals, peace, good, order, comfort, and
 
convenience of the city and the inhabitants thereof, and for
 
the protection of property therein; and enforce obedience
 
thereto with such lawful fines or penalties as the city council
 
may prescribe under the provisions of subsection 
(kk)
 of
 
this section.




General grants of police powers of this character in municipal charters are frequently referred to as ""the general welfare provisions"" of the municipal charter in which they
 
are found, and the provisions of the above-cited subsection of the charter of the city of Baguio will hereinafter be
 
referred to as the general welfare provisions of that charter.


It will be seen that very extensive police powers are
 
conferred upon the municipal council of the city of Baguio, and there can be but little ground for discussion as to the
 
power of the city council to adopt appropriate and reasonable ordinances, defining, prohibiting and penalizing gambling,
 
under the authority of the above-cited general welfare provisions of the Baguio Incorporation Act, unless it appears
 
that the ordinance as enacted is repugnant to or inconsistent with some general law of the Philippine Islands.


The principal contention of counsel for the appellants is that the Philippine Legislature having enacted a statute (Act No. 1757) defining, prohibiting and penalizing gambling, the exercise of power by the city council of Baguio to define, prohibit and penalize gambling should be held to be repugnant to or inconsistent with the prior exercise of
 
like power by the Philippine Legislature.


In the case of United States 
vs.
 Joson (26 Phil. Rep., 1), we ruled under the authority of many cases cited from the
 
reports of the courts of last resort in the United States, that under an 
express
 authority ""to provide against the evils of gambling, gambling houses, and disorderly houses of
 
whatever sort
 
.... An ordinance adopted in strict accordance with said charter provisions is valid, even though
 
there is a state law existing upon the same subject, regulating the same question."" In that case we cited with
 
approval Mcquillin to the effect that ""the general doctrine
 
is supported by the weight of judicial authority that an act
 
may be made penal offense under the statutes of the state, and further penalties may be imposed for its commission or omission by municipal ordinance."" We also quoted with
 
approval Cooley and Dillon as follows:




""Indeed, an act may be a penal offense under the laws
 
of the State, and further penalties, under proper legislative
 
authority, be imposed for its commission by municipal by- laws (ordinances) and the enforcement of the one would
 
not preclude the enforcement of the other."" (Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 6th ed., 239.).




Judge Cooley adds that ""such is the clear weight of
 
authority, though the decisions are not uniform.""


Judge Cooley quotes from the opinion in the case of
 
Rogers 
vs.
 Jones (1 Wend., N. Y., 238, 261), where it is
 
said"" ""But it is said that the by-law (ordinance) of a town
 
or corporation is void, if the legislature have regulated the
 
subject by law. If the legislature have passed a law regulating certain things in a city, I apprehend the corporations are not thereby restricted from making further
 
regulations. Cases of this kind have occurred and never
 
been questioned on that ground;
 
... the legislature
 
have imposed a penalty of $1 for servile labor on Sunday .The corporation of the city of New York have passed a
 
by-law imposing the penalty of $5 for the same offense. As
 
to storing gunpowder in New York, the legislature and the
 
corporation (of the city of New York) have each imposed
 
the same penalty. Suit to recover the penalties have been
 
sustained under the corporation law. It is believed that
 
the ground has never been taken that there was a conflict
 
with the State law.""


Judge Dillon, in his work on municipal corporations (5th
 
ed.), which has long been recognized as a standard, after a lengthy discussion and citation of authorities, fully
 
recognizing the conflict which exists, quotes approvingly from
 
Judge Cooley the following:""Although the decisions are not
 
uniform, the clear weight of authority is that the same act
 
may constitute an offense both against the State and the
 
municipal corporation and both may punish it without violating any constitutional principal.""




The question here presented, however, is distinguished from that considered in the former case by the fact that
 
the Baguio Incorporation Act (No. 1963), unlike the general
 
statutes for the organization of municipalities throughout
 
the Islands, contains no express grant of power to enact ordinances prohibiting and penalizing gambling; and that
 
the city council of Baguio enacted the ordinance in question not under an express grant of authority to define, prohibit, and penalize gambling but under and by virtue of the general police powers conferred upon the city by the above-cited
 
""general welfare provisions.""


This question is not without difficulty sa will readily be
 
seen from the far uniform rulings announced in the large array of cases treating of this subject to be found in the reports, many of which are cited in the footnotes, paragraph 895, volume 3, McQuillin on Municipal Corporations,
 
and paragraphs 631, 632, 633, volume 2, Dillon on Municipal Corporations, fifth edition.


We think, however, that the fair and logical conclusion which should be drawn from the decided cases, as well as
 
from the general principles which should control in such
 
cases, is well stated by Dillon, as follows:




. . . There are many acts of such a nature that
 
they 
may
, if the legislature has so provided, be an offense against the state at large, and also against the special and
 
local government of the municipality. Accordingly, where
 
an act is prohibited both by statute and by ordinance, it
 
may constitute two offenses, one against the State and the
 
other against the city or town, and where such is the case
 
a conviction of one may not be pleaded as constituting former jeopardy when the offender is prosecuted for the other,
 
and where such is the case the weight of authority also
 
seems to hold that power to enact ordinances with reference
 
thereto may be included in the general powers conferred
 
on cities and towns by statue. (Dillon on Municipal
 
Corporations, vol. II, 5th ed., 633.)




In our former opinion, United States 
vs.
 Joson (
supra
), we said that, under the general doctrine, ""an act may be
 
made a penal offense under the statutes of the state, and
 
further penalties may be imposed for its commission or
 
omission by municipal ordinance."" Under that decision we
 
held that the express grant of power to a municipality to
 
enact ordinances prohibiting and penalizing a particular act
 
sufficiently disclosed the legislative intent that notwithstanding the fact that the commission of the act may have
 
been made a penal offense against the state at large, it
 
may, by municipal ordinance, be lawfully denounced and
 
penalized as an offense against the special and local government of the municipality.


Upon like reasoning, we are of opinion that where the commission or omission of a particular act is, in its nature, such that that its commission or omission within the territorial
 
limits of a certain municipality constitutes a separate offense
 
against the municipality, or in any case wherein it appears
 
that the commission or omission of an act penalized under
 
the general laws of the state within the territorial limits of
 
a particular municipality, aggravates the character of the
 
offense and necessitates or justifies the adoption of additional repressive measures for its suppression by the
 
municipality, such municipality may adopt ordinances
 
prescribing additional penalties for the commission or omission of such act under and by virtue of the general police powers
 
conferred upon it by the ""general welfare clause"" of its charter. Of course, the subject matter of the ordinance must, in such cases, fall within the purview of the general police powers conferred upon the municipality under the
 
""general welfare clause"" of its charter; but if it does, the
 
mere fact that the commission or omission of the prohibited
 
act has already been penalized by general statute is not
 
sufficient to negative the legislative intent to empower the
 
municipality to enact ordinances with reference thereto
 
under the general police powers set forth in the ""general
 
welfare clause"" of the municipal charter. Thus it was said in
 
Wood 
vs.
 City of Brooklyn (14 Barb., 425, 426): ""There
 
are the very best of reasons why cities should be authorized
 
to impose penalties in addition to those inflicted by the
 
laws of the State. ""Particular acts may be far more
 
injurious, while the temptation to commit them may be much
 
greater in a crowded city than in the State generally. They
 
consequently require more severe measures for prevention .State laws are, of course, for the general good, and cannot
 
always answer the peculiar wants of particular localities.""


Thus drunkenness, disorderly conduct, smoking of opium and the keeping of opium dens, gambling, and the keeping of gambling dens and the like, are offenses the commission of which within the limits of a thickly settled urban
 
community may well carry with it consequences peculiarly
 
subversive of the good order and general welfare of such a
 
community which would be wholly, or in large part, absent
 
if committed in a sparsely settled community. It would
 
seem, therefore, that special repressive measures by the
 
municipal authorities under a general grant of police powers are justified and ofttimes necessary in dealing with those offenses.


We are aware that the rulings of the courts of last resort
 
in the United States are not altogether consistent in this
 
regard, but, as pointed out by McQuillin, in par. 889, vol.
 
III: ""It is certain that the recent judicial decisions incline
 
to give a more extensive scope to the police power than the
 
earlier cases. The general welfare idea is expanding rapidly. In its application to urban life it is wide and varied. This generation has witnessed a decided change in the views
 
of the courts relating to the construction and practical operation of police ordinances. Greater power is conceded to be vested in the public authorities. Their judgment and
 
discretion is more respected. The public welfare in its
 
broadest sense has been adopted as the basis of construction. This position is sound, and is certain to aid materially
 
the development of better urban conditions.""


And to like effect in paragraph 876, volume II: ""The
 
decisions on this subject are numerous and conflicting. Perhaps on no single topic of municipal corporation law have
 
there been so many discordant utterances even by the same
 
courts and the same individual judges. But the best
 
considered cases, especially the more recent ones, have properly
 
extended the sphere of activity of the municipal corporation
 
in dealing with police offenses. The necessity of thus
 
enlarging municipal jurisdiction is obvious to the careful
 
student of the conditions and needs of the crowded modern
 
urban centers of population. The earlier conceptions of
 
our courts on this subject are less definite and satisfactory.""


We conclude that an ordinance enacted under a general
 
grant of police powers, prohibiting and penalizing the
 
commission of one of these offenses as an offense against the
 
peace and good order of the municipality, is not necessarily
 
inconsistent with, or repugnant to a general statute prohibiting and penalizing the commission of the act as an offense
 
against the state.


The appellants inn this case were convicted of a violation of an ordinance of the city of Baguio prohibiting and
 
penalizing gambling enacted under and by virtue of the
 
powers conferred by the above-cited subsection (
ii
) of
 
section 8 of the Baguio Incorporation Act. The powers thus
 
conferred in general terms on the municipal council of the
 
city of Baguio are manifestly wide enough in scope to
 
include the enactment of an ordinance prohibiting and
 
penalizing gambling, unless such ordinance appears to be
 
repugnant to or inconsistent with some general statute. The general purpose and objection of the ordinance, looking as
 
it does to the suppression of gambling in the city of Baguio, is manifestly in harmony with the provisions of the general
 
statute prohibiting and penalizing gambling; and from what
 
has already been said we think it must be held that there
 
is nothing inherently repugnant in the enactment of an
 
ordinance prohibiting and penalizing gambling as an offense
 
against the peace and good order of the city of Baguio, notwithstanding the fact that under the general statute, gambling has been declared to be a penal offense against the
 
peace and good order of the state.


Appellants having failed to establish their contentions as to the invalidity of the ordinance, their appeal must be
 
dismissed with the costs of this instance against them, under
 
the rule laid down in the case of United States 
vs.
 Tamparong (
supra
). So ordered.


Arellano, C.J., Torres, Johnson, Trent, and Araullo, JJ.,
