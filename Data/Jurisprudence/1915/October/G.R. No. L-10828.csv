G.R. No. L-10828             October 28, 1915


CANG KAI GUAN,
 plaintiff-appellant,

vs.


THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS,
 defendant-appellee.


P.E. del Rosario for appellant.

Acting Attorney-General Zaragosa for appellee.




JOHNSON, 
J.:


The plaintiff and appellant arrived at the port of Cebu on the 19th of November, 1914, on the steamship 
Linan
, and asked permission to enter the Philippine Islands. An investigation was held by the board of special inquiry who denied the petition of the plaintiff.


An appeal was taken to the Collector of Customs, the Honorable B. Herstein, who, after considering the facts, affirmed the decision of the board of special inquiry and ordered the said Cang Kai Guan deported.


Later a petition for the writ of 
habeas corpus
 was presented in the Court of First Instance of Cebu. The cause was submitted to the Honorable Adolph Wislizenus, judge, who, after hearing the respective parties, denied the petition for the writ of 
habeas corpus. 
From that decision the plaintiff appeals to this court and makes several assignments of error.

From an examination of the record, the following facts appear to be undisputed: (first) that the plaintiff arrived at the port of Cebu on the 19th of November, 1914, on the steamship 
Linan
, and asked permission to enter the Philippine Islands; (second) that he was born in China and was a Chinaman; (third) that he was eighteen years of age; (fourth) that he had never been in the Philippine Islands; (fifth) that his father had died in China about six years before; that his father, for some years before his death, had been a merchant in the Philippine Islands; (sixth) that he was not possessed of the ""section six certificate.""


The foregoing facts present the question whether or not the minor son of a Chinese merchant may enter the Philippine Islands without the ""section six certificate,"" after the death of his father. This question has been fully discussed in the case of 
Tan Lin Jo vs. Collector of Customs 
(p. 78, 
ante
), and there held that such minor can not enter the Philippine Islands without the ""section six certificate."" And without repeating here the arguments in that case, the judgment of the Court of First Instance is hereby affirmed with costs. So ordered.


Arellano, C.J., Torres, Carson, and Araullo, JJ., concur.
