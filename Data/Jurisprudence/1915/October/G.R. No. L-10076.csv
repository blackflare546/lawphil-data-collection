vs.


FERNANDA FELISA CORRALES, ET AL.,
 defendants-appellants.


Assistant City Attorney Moreno Lacalle for plaintiff.

Thos. D. Aitken for defendants.




JOHNSON, 
J.:


The present action was commenced on the 22nd of May, 1913, in the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila. It was brought for the purpose of condemning certain property under the power of eminent domain. The complaint alleged that the property in question was necessary for the purpose of opening or building a street running from Calle Marques de Comillas to Calle Nozaleda, crossing Calle San Marcelino and Taft Avenue. The plaintiff was able to purchase much of the land necessary for said construction. The property involved in the present action is represented by the following plan:




The question of the necessity for said condemnation was submitted to the court. After hearing the respective parties it was agreed that the opening or construction of said proposed street was necessary. Whereupon, by agreement of all the parties, Mauro Prieto, Alfonso Tiaoqui, and Denis J. Mahoney were appointed as commissioners to view and appraise the property involved in the present action and to report their findings and conclusions to the court. said commissioners were duly sworn and entered upon the performance of their duty. They held many sessions and heard all of the witnesses which the respective parties desired to present.


After hearing all of the proofs presented relating to the value of the property involved, said commissioners unanimously agree upon and made the following report:




By virtue of an order issued by the Honorable A.S. Crossfield, judge Court of First Instance, under date of September 1, 1913, the undersigned, Mauro Prieto, Alfonso Tiaoqui and Denis J. Mahoney were appointed commissioners to hear the parties, view the premises and assess the damages to be paid for the condemnation of the properties required to be expropriated in the above-entitled case.


The commissioners, after having duly qualified and after having duly notified all the parties concerned, inspected the premises to be expropriated on September 13, 1913, and on the same date and on various subsequent dates held various sessions at which evidence, oral and documentary, relative to the property of Fernanda F. Corrales and children was offered and received. A complete report of the proceedings is submitted herewith.


After all the evidence obtainable had been submitted by the litigants, the commissioners, after a careful analytical study of the evidence, decided to make the following appraisement and assessment of damages for the premises to be expropriated belonging to Fernanda F. Corrales and children. The land sought to be expropriated, parcel No. 2, Exhibit A hereto attached, was found to be considerably lower than the present level of Calle Marques de Comillas and lower than level of the proposed boulevard:






For parcel No. 2, city engineer's plan F-10-161 F, hereto attached and marked Exhibit A, having an area of 1,837.20 sq. m., after deducting cost of fill required to bring to normal street level
P9,284.15


This sum is arrived at by the following calculations:


30 meters deep, Calle M. de Comillas, 483.76 sq. m., @ P8.00
P3,870.08


Interior area, 1,353.44 sq. m., @ P5.00
6,767.20


Total, 1,837.20 sq. m.
10,637.28


Deduct cost of fill, 1,082.5 cubic meters, @ P1.25
1,353.13


Net value of land, present condition
9,284.15


For the tienda indicated as building No. 2 on city engineer's plan above quoted			2,000.00


For damages to residence, building No. 1 Exhibit A, and for cost of necessary rearrangement consequent on appropriation
8,105.00


For the
 litografia,
 building No. 3 Exhibit A
7,920.00


For cost of removing machinery from present site and reinstalling on another location
2,100.00


For stable or
 camarin
 known as building No. 4
376.00


For damages incident to the stoppage of business for a period of three months, more or less
2,000.00


Total
31,785.15






In reviewing the testimony of the various witnesses, that of Sellner was taken as being the most reasonable and logical with regard to the value of the land, and the uncontradicted testimony of Latimer was used as a basis on which the estimated cost of fill to be deducted was considered and determined. With regard to the main building marked No. 1, Exhibit A, and the stable marked building No. 4, the evidence of Perez Muñoz and George B. Asp were considered jointly. Asp's testimony was taken as the basis for the value placed on the
 litografia
, building No. 3, Exhibit A, and the certificate of the city assessor and collector taken for the value placed on the tienda marked building No. 2 thereon. The item of P2,100 for removing and reinstalling the machinery was agreed on between the parties in litigation and the sum of P2,000 recommended to and awarded for the stoppage of business was based on the testimony of E.C. McCullough.


It will be noted that the actual figures given in Latimer's testimony as the cost of filing were P1.65, but the undersigned believe that this price is excessive and have therefore recommended a deduction of only P1.25 per cubic meter to be allowed.


Respectfully submitted.
