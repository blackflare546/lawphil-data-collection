ESGUERRA, 
J.:


On December 29, 1964, the Court of Tax Appeals in its Case No. 1349 rendered judgment upholding the assessment of income tax made by the Collector of Internal Revenue on the estate of the late Mary McDonald Bachrach, from January 1, 1960 to August 9, 1960, and ordering the administrator thereof, herein petitioner Modesto T. Flores, to pay to respondent Commissioner of the Internal Revenue, or his representative, the sum of P316,541.00 with ½% monthly interest from April 18, 1961 to February 12, 1963. If the deficiency tax was not paid within 30 days from the date the decision becomes final, petitioner is ordered to pay surcharge and interest as provided in Section 51(e) of the National Internal Revenue Code, The petitioner appealed to this Court by petition for review for the reversal of the above-mentioned judgment. Briefs of the petitioner and the respondent were duly filed and on January 20, 1966, this case was submitted for decision.


On January 22, 1973, petitioner moved for the dismissal of the appeal from the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, on the ground that he had availed himself of the Presidential Decree No. 68 dated November 24, 1972, granting amnesty to taxpayers with delinquent tax accounts by reducing their tax liability by 40% if the delinquent tax was paid on or before January 31, 1973. Petitioner alleged in his motion for dismissal that as administrator he paid on January 10, 1973, the amount of P266,375.11 as the tax liability of the testate estate of Mary McDonald Bachrach in accordance with said Presidential Decree. This amount is more than 60% of the tax liability of the said estate in accordance with the computation of respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and payment thereof is evidenced by Official Receipt No. 488233-E dated January 10, 1973, issued therefor.


By resolution of this Court dated January 29, 1973, the motion for dismissal of the appeal was referred to the Solicitor General as counsel for the respondent herein for comment.


On February 3, 1973, the Solicitor General submitted the following comments:






1.	That petitioner did pay on January 10, 1973 to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, thru the Central Bank of the Philippines, the amount of P266,375.11;

3.	That amount paid is actually more than 60% (contrary to petitioner's own statement that it is one-half' or 50%) of the judgment under review, as shown in the computation made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (please see attached letter);


4.	That the payment is therefore in strict compliance with Presidential Decrees No. 68 dated 24 November 1972 as well as Revenue Regulations No. 14-72 dated 8 December 1972, pertinent portions of which read as follows:
