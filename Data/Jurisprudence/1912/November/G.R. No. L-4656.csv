TORRES, 
J.:


This is an appeal by bill of exceptions, from the judgment of October 5, 1907, whereby the Honorable Dionisio Chanco, judge, absolved the defendants from the complaint, and the plaintiff from a counterclaim, without special finding as to costs. 


Counsel for the spouses Ricardo y Cruz and Vicente Ortiz y Felin de Pardell, the first of whom, absent in Spain by reason of his employment, conferred upon the second sufficient and ample powers to appear before the courts of justice, on June 8, 1905, in his written complaint, alleged that the plaintiff, Vicente Ortiz, and the defendant, Matilde Ortiz, are the duly recognized natural daughters of the spouses Miguel Ortiz and Calixta Felin y Paula who died in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, in 1875 and 1882, respectively; that Calixta Felin, prior to her death, executed on August 17, 1876, a nuncupative will in Vigan whereby she made her four children, named Manuel, Francisca, Vicenta, and Matilde, surnamed Ortiz y Felin, her sole and universal heirs of all her property; that, of the persons enumerated, Manuel died before his mother and Francisca a few years after her death, leaving no heirs by force of law, and therefore the only existing heirs of the said testatrix are the plaintiff Vicenta Ortiz and the defendant Matilde Ortiz; that, aside from some personal property and jewelry already divided among the heirs, the testatrix possessed, at the time of the execution of her will, and left at her death the real properties which, with their respective cash values, are as follows:






1. A house of strong material, with the lot on which it is built, situated on Escolta Street, Vigan, and valued at
P6,000.00


2. A house of mixed material, with the lot on which it stands, at No. 88 Washington Street, Vigan; valued at
1,500.00


3. A lot on Magallanes Street, Vigan; valued at
100.00


4. A parcel of rice land, situated in the barrio of San Julian, Vigan; valued at
60.00


5. A parcel of rice land in the pueblo of Santa Lucia; valued at
86.00


6. Three parcels of land in the pueblo of Candon; valued at
150.00


Total
7,896.00






That, on or about the first months of the year 1888, the defendants, without judicial authorization, nor friendly or extrajudicial agreement, took upon themselves the administration and enjoyment of the said properties and collected the rents, fruits, and products thereof, to the serious detriment of the plaintiffs' interest; that, notwithstanding the different and repeated demands extrajudicially made upon Matilde Ortiz to divide the aforementioned properties with the plaintiff Vicente and to deliver to the latter the one-half thereof, together with one-half of the fruits and rents collected therefrom, the said defendant and her husband, the self-styled administrator of the properties mentioned, had been delaying the partition and delivery of the said properties by means of unkept promises and other excuses; and that the plaintiffs, on account of the extraordinary delay in the delivery of one-half of said properties, or their value in cash, as the case might be, had suffered losses and damages in the sum of P8,000. Said counsel for the plaintiffs therefore asked that judgment be rendered by sentencing the defendants, Gaspar de Bartolome, and Matilde Ortiz Felin de Bartolome, to restore and deliver to the plaintiffs one-half of the total value in cash, according to appraisal, of the undivided property specified, which one-half amounted approximately to P3,948, or if deemed proper, to recognize the plaintiff Vicenta Ortiz to be vested with the full and absolute right of ownership to the said undivided one-half of the properties in question, as universal testamentary heir thereof together with the defendant Matilde Ortiz, to indemnify the plaintiffs in the sum of P8,000, for losses and damages, and to pay the costs. 


Counsel for the defendants, in his answer denied the facts alleged in paragraphs 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 thereof, inasmuch as, upon the death of the litigating sister's brother Manuel, their mother, who was still living, was his heir by force of law, and the defendants had never refused to give to the plaintiff Vicente Ortiz her share of the said properties; and stated that he admitted the facts alleged in paragraph 2, provided it be understood, however, that the surname of the defendant's mother was Felin, and not Feliu, and that Miguel Ortiz died in Spain, and not in Vigan; that he also admitted paragraph 3 of the complaint, with the difference that the said surname should be Felin, and likewise paragraph 5, except the part thereof relating to the personal property and the jewelry, since the latter had not yet been divided; that the said jewelry was in the possession of the plaintiffs and consisted of: one Lozada gold chronometer watch with a chain in the form of a bridle curb and a watch charm consisting of the engraving of a postage stamp on a stone mounted in gold and bearing the initials M. O., a pair of cuff buttons made of gold coins, four small gold buttons, two finger rings, another with the initials M. O., and a gold bracelet; and that the defendants were willing to deliver to the plaintiffs, in conformity with their petitions, one-half of the total value in cash, according to appraisement, of the undivided real properties specified in paragraph 5, which half amounted to P3,948. 


In a special defense said counsel alleged that the defendants had never refused to divide the said property and had in fact several years before solicited the partition of the same; that, from 1886 to 1901, inclusive, there was collected from the property on Calle Escolta the sum of 288 pesos, besides a few other small amounts derived from other sources, which were delivered to the plaintiffs with other larger amounts, in 1891, and from the property on Calle Washington, called 
La Quinta
, 990.95 pesos, which proceeds, added together, made a total of 1,278.95 pesos, saving error or omission; that, between the years abovementioned, Escolta, and that on Calle Washington, 
La Quinta
, 376.33, which made a total of 1,141.71, saving error or omission; that, in 1897, the work of reconstruction was begun of the house on Calle Escolta, which been destroyed by an earthquake, which work was not finished until 1903 and required an expenditure on the part of the defendant Matilde Ortiz, of 5,091.52 pesos; that all the collections made up to August 1, 1905, including the rent from the stores, amounted to only P3,654.15, and the expenses, to P6,252.32, there being, consequently, a balance of P2,598.17, which divided between the sisters, the plaintiff and the defendant, would make the latter's share P1,299.08; that, as shown by the papers kept by the plaintiffs, in the year 1891 the defendant Bartolome presented to the plaintiffs a statement in settlements of accounts, and delivered to the person duly authorized by the latter for the purpose, the sum of P2,606.29, which the said settlement showed was owing his principals, from various sources; that, the defendant Bartolome having been the administrator of the undivided property claimed by the plaintiffs, the latter were owing the former legal remuneration of the percentage allowed by law for administration; and that the defendants were willing to pay the sum of P3,948, one-half of the total value of the said properties, deducting therefrom the amount found to be owing them by the plaintiffs, and asked that judgment be rendered in their favor to enable them to recover from the latter that amount, together with the costs and expenses of the suit. 


The defendants, in their counter claim, repeated each and all of the allegations contained in each of the paragraphs of section 10 of their answer; that the plaintiffs were obliged to pay to the administrator of the said property the remuneration allowed him by law; that, as the revenues collected by the defendants amounted to no more than P3,654.15 and the expenditures incurred by them, to P6,252.32, it followed that the plaintiffs owed the defendants P1,299.08, that is one-half of the difference between the amount collected from and that extended on the properties, and asked that judgment be therefore rendered in their behalf to enable them to collect this sum from the plaintiffs, Ricardo Pardell and Vicenta Ortiz, with legal interest thereon from December 7, 1904, the date when the accounts were rendered, together with the sums to which the defendant Bartolome was entitled for the administration of the undivided properties in question. 


By a written motion of August 21, 1905, counsel for the plaintiffs requested permission to amend the complaint by inserting immediately after the words ""or respective appraisal,"" fifth line of paragraph 5, the phrase ""in cash in accordance with the assessed value,"" and likewise further to amend the same, in paragraph 6 thereof, by substituting the following word in lieu of the petition for the remedy sought: ""By reason of all the foregoing, I beg the court to be pleased to render the judgment by sentencing the defendants, Gaspar de Bartolome and Matilde Ortiz Felin de Bartolome, to restore and deliver to the plaintiffs an exact one-half of the total vale of the undivided properties described in the complaint, such value to be ascertained by the expert appraisal of two competent persons, one of whom shall be appointed by the plaintiffs and the other by the defendants, and, in case of disagreement between these two appointees such value shall be determined by a third expert appraiser appointed by the court, or, in a proper case, by the price offered at public auction; or, in lieu thereof, it is requested that the court recognize the plaintiff, Vicenta Ortiz, to be vested with a full and absolute right to an undivided one-half of the said properties; furthermore, it is prayed that the plaintiffs be awarded an indemnity of P8,000 for losses and damages, and the costs."" Notwithstanding the opposition of the defendants, the said amendment was admitted by the court and counsel for the defendants were allowed to a period of three days within which to present a new answer. An exception was taken to this ruling. 


The proper proceedings were had with reference to the valuation of the properties concerned in the division sought and incidental issues were raised relative to the partition of some of them and their award to one or the other of the parties. Due consideration was taken of the averments and statements of both parties who agreed between themselves, before the court, that any of them might at any time acquire, at the valuation fixed by the expert judicial appraiser, any of the properties in question, there being none in existence excluded by the litigants. The court, therefore, by order of December 28, 1905, ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to acquire, at the valuation determined by the said expert appraiser, the building known as 
La Quinta
, the lot on which it stands and the warehouses and other improvements comprised within the inclosed land, and the seeds lands situated in the pueblos of Vigan and Santa Lucia; and that the defendants were likewise entitled to acquire the house on Calle Escolta, the lot on Calle Magallanes, and the three parcels of land situated in the pueblo of Candon. 


After this partition had been made counsel for the defendants, by a writing of March 8, 1906, set forth: That, having petitioned for the appraisement of the properties in question for the purpose of their partition, it was not to be understood that he desired from the exception duly entered to the ruling made in the matter of the amendment to the complaint; that the properties retained by the defendants were valued at P9,310, and those retained by the plaintiffs, at P2,885, one-half of which amounts each party had to deliver to the other, as they were
 pro indiviso 
properties; that, therefore, the defendants had to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P3,212.50, after deducting the amount which the plaintiffs were obliged to deliver to the defendants, as one-half of the price of the properties retained by the former; that, notwithstanding that the amount of the counterclaim for the expenses incurred in the reconstruction of the pro indiviso property should be deducted from the sum which the defendants had to pay the plaintiffs, the former, for the purpose of bringing the matter of the partition to a close, would deliver to the latter, immediately upon the signing of the instrument of purchase and sale, the sum of P3,212.50, which was one-half of the value of the properties alloted to the defendants; such delivery, however, was not to be understood as a renouncement of the said counterclaim, but only as a means for the final termination of the
 pro indiviso 
status of the property. 


The case having been heard, the court on October 5, 1907, rendered judgment holding that the revenues and the expenses were compensated by the residence enjoyed by the defendant party, that no losses or damages were either caused or suffered, nor likewise any other expense besides those aforementioned, and absolved the defendants from the complaint and the plaintiffs from the counterclaim, with no special finding as to costs. An exception was taken to this judgment by counsel for the defendants who moved for a new trial on the grounds that the evidence presented did not warrant the judgment rendered and that the latter was contrary to law. This motion was denied, exception whereto was taken by said counsel, who filed the proper bill of exceptions, and the same was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court, with a transcript of the evidence. 


Both of the litigating sisters assented to a partition by halves of the property left in her will by their mother at her death; in fact, during the course of this suit, proceedings were had, in accordance with the agreement made, for the division between them of the said hereditary property of common ownership, which division was recognized and approved in the findings of the trial court, as shown by the judgment appealed from. 


The issues raised by the parties, aside from said division made during the trial, and which have been submitted to this court for decision, concern: (1) The indemnity claimed for losses and damages, which the plaintiffs allege amount to P8,000, in addition to the rents which should have been derived from the house on Calle Escolta, Vigan; (2) the payment by the plaintiffs to the defendants of the sum of P1,299.08, demanded by way of counterclaim, together with legal interest thereon from December 7, 1904; (3) the payment to the husband of the defendant Matilde Ortiz, of a percentage claimed to be due him as the administrator of the property of common ownership; (4) the division of certain jewelry in the possession of the plaintiff Vicenta Ortiz; and (5) the petition that the amendment be held to have been improperly admitted, which was made by the plaintiffs in their written motion of August 21, 1905, against the opposition of the defendants, through which admission the latter were obliged to pay the former P910.50.

Before entering upon an explanation of the propriety or impropriety of the claims made by both parties, it is indispensable to state that the trial judge, in absolving the defendants from the complaint, held that they had not caused losses and damages to the plaintiffs, and that the revenues and the expenses were compensated, in view of the fact that the defendants had been living for several years in the Calle Escolta house, which was
 pro indiviso 
property of joint ownership.


By this finding absolving the defendants from the complaint, and which was acquiesced in by the plaintiffs who made no appeal therefrom, 
the first issue has been decided 
which was raised by the plaintiffs, concerning the indemnity for losses and damages, wherein are comprised the rents which should have been obtained from the upper story of the said house during the time it was occupied by the defendants, Matilde Ortiz and her husband, Gaspar de Bartolome. 


Notwithstanding the acquiescence on the part of the plaintiffs, assenting to the said finding whereby the defendants were absolved from the complaint, yet, as such absolution is based on the compensation established in the judgment of the trial court, between the amounts which each party is entitled to claim from the other, it is imperative to determine whether the defendant Matilde Ortiz, as coowner of the house on Calle Escolta, was entitled, with her husband, to reside therein, without paying to her coowner, Vicenta Ortiz, who, during the greater part of the time, lived with her husband abroad, one-half of the rents which the upper story would have produced, had it been rented to a stranger. 


Article 394 of the Civil Code prescribes:




Each coowner may use the things owned in common, provided he uses them in accordance with their object and in such manner as not to injure the interests of the community nor prevent the coowners from utilizing them according to their rights.




Matilde Ortiz and her husband occupied the upper story, designed for use as a dwelling, in the house of joint ownership; but the record shows no proof that, by so doing, the said Matilde occasioned any detriment to the interest of the community property, nor that she prevented her sister Vicenta from utilizing the said upper story according to her rights. It is to be noted that the stores of the lower floor were rented and accounting of the rents was duly made to the plaintiffs. 


Each coowner of realty held
 pro indiviso 
exercises his rights over the whole property and may use and enjoy the same with no other limitation than that he shall not injure the interests of his coowners, for the reason that, until a division be made, the respective part of each holder can not be determined and every one of the coowners exercises, together with his other coparticipants, joint ownership over the
 pro indiviso 
property, in addition to his use and enjoyment of the same. 


As the hereditary properties of the joint ownership of the two sisters, Vicenta Ortiz, plaintiff, and Matilde Ortiz, defendant, were situated in the Province of Ilocos Sur, and were in the care of the last named, assisted by her husband, while the plaintiff Vicenta with her husband was residing outside of the said province the greater part of the time between 1885 and 1905, when she left these Islands for Spain, it is not at all strange that delays and difficulties should have attended the efforts made to collect the rents and proceeds from the property held in common and to obtain a partition of the latter, especially during several years when, owing to the insurrection, the country was in a turmoil; and for this reason, aside from that founded on the right of coownership of the defendants, who took upon themselves the administration and care of the properties of joint tenancy for purposes of their preservation and improvement, these latter are not obliged to pay to the plaintiff Vicenta one-half of the rents which might have been derived from the upper of the story of the said house on Calle Escolta, and, much less, because one of the living rooms and the storeroom thereof were used for the storage of some belongings and effects of common ownership between the litigants. The defendant Matilde, therefore, in occupying with her husband the upper floor of the said house, did not injure the interests of her coowner, her sister Vicenta, nor did she prevent the latter from living therein, but merely exercised a legitimate right pertaining to her as coowner of the property. 


Notwithstanding the above statements relative to the joint-ownership rights which entitled the defendants to live in the upper story of the said house, yet in view of the fact that the record shows it to have been proved that the defendant Matilde's husband, Gaspar de Bartolome, occupied for four years a room or a part of the lower floor of the same house on Calle Escolta, using it as an office for the justice of the peace, a position which he held in the capital of that province, strict justice, requires that he pay his sister-in-law, the plaintiff, one half of the monthly rent which the said quarters could have produced, had they been leased to another person. The amount of such monthly rental is fixed at P16 in accordance with the evidence shown in the record. This conclusion as to Bartolome's liability results from the fact that, even as the husband of the defendant coowner of the property, he had no right to occupy and use gratuitously the said part of the lower floor of the house in question, where he lived with his wife, to the detriment of the plaintiff Vicenta who did not receive one-half of the rent which those quarters could and should have produced, had they been occupied by a stranger, in the same manner that rent was obtained from the rooms on the lower floor that were used as stores. Therefore, the defendant Bartolome must pay to the plaintiff Vicenta P384, that is, one-half of P768, the total amount of the rents which should have been obtained during four years from the quarters occupied as an office by the justice of the peace of Vigan. 


With respect to the second question submitted for decision to this court, relative to the payment of the sum demanded as a counterclaim, it was admitted and proved in the present case that, as a result of a serious earthquake on August 15, 1897, the said house on Calle Escolta was left in ruins and uninhabitable, and that, for its reconstruction or repair, the defendants had to expend the sum of P6,252.32. This expenditure, notwithstanding that it was impugned, during the trial, by the plaintiffs, was duly proved by the evidence presented by the defendants. Evidence, unsuccessfully rebutted, was also introduced which proved that the rents produced by all the rural and urban properties of common ownership amounted, up to August 1, 1905, to the sum of P3,654.15 which, being applied toward the cost of the repair work on the said house, leaves a balance of P2,598.17, the amount actually advanced by the defendants, for the rents collected by them were not sufficient for the termination of all the work undertaken on the said building, necessary for its complete repair and to replace it in a habitable condition. It is therefore lawful and just that the plaintiff Vicenta Ortiz, who was willing to sell to her sister Matilde for P1,500, her share in the house in question, when it was in a ruinous state, should pay the defendants one-half of the amount expanded in the said repair work, since the building after reconstruction was worth P9,000, according to expert appraisal. Consequently, the counterclaim made by the defendants for the payment to them of the sum of P1,299.08, is a proper demand, though from this sum a reduction must be made of P384, the amount of one-half of the rents which should have been collected for the use of the quarters occupied by the justice of the peace, the payment of which is incumbent upon the husband of the defendant Matilde, as aforesaid, and the balance remaining, P915.08, is the amount which the plaintiff Vicenta must pay to the defendants. 


The defendants claim to be entitled to the collection of legal interest on the amount of the counterclaim, from December 7, 1904. This contention can not be sustained, inasmuch as, until this suit is finally decided, it could not be known whether the plaintiffs would or would not be obliged to pay the sum whatever in reimbursement of expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in the repair work on the said house on Calle Escolta, whether or not the defendants, in turn, were entitled to collect any such amount, and, finally, what the net sum would be which the plaintiff's might have to pay as reimbursement for one-half of the expenditure made by the defendants. Until final disposal of the case, no such net sum can be determined, nor until then can the debtor be deemed to be in arrears. In order that there be an obligation to pay legal interest in connection with a matter at issue between the parties, it must be declared in a judicial decision from what date the interest will be due on the principal concerned in the suit. This rule has been established by the decisions of the supreme court of Spain, in reference to articles 1108, 1109, and 1110 of the Civil Code, reference on April 24, 1867, November 19, 1869, and February 22, 1901. 


With regard to the percentage, as remuneration claimed by the husband of the defendant Matilde for his administration of the property of common ownership, inasmuch as no stipulation whatever was made in the matter by and between him and his sister-in-law, the said defendant, the claimant is not entitled to the payment of any remuneration whatsoever. Of his own accord and as an officious manager, he administered the said
 pro indiviso 
property, one-half of which belonged to his wife who held it in joint tenancy, with his sister-in-law, and the law does not allow him any compensation as such voluntary administrator. He is merely entitled to a reimbursement for such actual and necessary expenditures as he may have made on the undivided properties and an indemnity for the damages he may have suffered while acting in that capacity, since at all events it was his duty to care for and preserve the said property, half of which belonged to his wife; and in exchange for the trouble occasioned him by the administration of his sister-in-law's half of the said property, he with his wife resided in the upper story of the house aforementioned, without payment of one-half of the rents said quarters might have produced had they been leased to another person. 


With respect to the division of certain jewelry, petitioned for by the defendants and appellants only in their brief in this appeal, the record of the proceedings in the lower court does not show that the allegation made by the plaintiff Vicenta is not true, to the effect that the deceased mother of the litigant sisters disposed of this jewelry during her lifetime, because, had she not done so, the will made by the said deceased would have been exhibited in which the said jewelry would have been mentioned, at least it would have been proved that the articles in question came into the possession of the plaintiff Vicenta without the expressed desire and the consent of the deceased mother of the said sisters, for the gift of this jewelry was previously assailed in the courts, without success; therefore, and in view of its inconsiderable value, there is no reason for holding that the said gift was not made. 


As regards the collection of the sum of P910.50, which is the difference between the assessed value of the undivided real properties and the price of the same as determined by the judicial expert appraiser, it is shown by the record that the ruling of the trial judge admitting the amendment to the original complaint, is in accord with the law and principles of justice, for the reason that any of the coowners of a
 pro indiviso 
property, subject to division or sale, is entitled to petition for its valuation by competent expert appraisers. Such valuation is not prejudicial to any of the joint owners, but is beneficial to their interests, considering that, as a general rule, the assessed value of a building or a parcel of realty is less than the actual real value of the property, and this being appraiser to determine, in conjunction with the one selected by the plaintiffs, the value of the properties of joint ownership. These two experts took part in the latter proceedings of the suit until finally, and during the course of the latter, the litigating parties agreed to an amicable division of the
 pro indiviso 
hereditary property, in accordance with the price fixed by the judicial expert appraiser appointed as a third party, in view of the disagreement between and nonconformity of the appraisers chosen by the litigants. Therefore it is improper now to claim a right to the collection of the said sum, the difference between the assessed value and that fixed by the judicial expert appraiser, for the reason that the increase in price, as determined by this latter appraisal, redounded to the benefit of both parties. 


In consideration of the foregoing, whereby the errors assigned to the lower court have been duly refuted, it is our opinion that, with a partial reversal of the judgment appealed from, in so far as it absolves the plaintiffs from the counterclaim presented by the defendants, we should and hereby do sentence the plaintiffs to the payment of the sum of P915.08, the balance of the sum claimed by the defendants as a balance of the one-half of the amount which the defendants advanced for the reconstruction or repair of the Calle Escolta house, after deducting from the total of such sum claimed by the latter the amount of P384 which Gaspar de Bartolome, the husband of the defendant Matilde, should have paid as one-half of the rents due for his occupation of the quarters on the lower floor of the said house as an office for the justice of the peace court of Vigan; and we further find: (1) That the defendants are not obliged to pay one-half of the rents which could have been obtained from the upper story of the said house; (2) that the plaintiffs can not be compelled to pay the legal interest from December 7, 1904, on the sum expanded in the reconstruction of the aforementioned house, but only the interest fixed by law, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, from the date of the judgment to be rendered in accordance with this decision; (3) that the husband of the defendant Matilde Ortiz is not entitled to any remuneration for the administration of the
 pro indiviso 
property belonging to both parties; (4) that, neither is he entitled to collect from the plaintiffs the sum of P910.50, the difference between the assessed valuation and the price set by the expert appraisal solicited by the plaintiffs in their amendment to the complaint; and, (5) that no participation shall be made of jewelry aforementioned now in the possession of the plaintiff Vicenta Ortiz. The said judgment, as relates to the points appealed, is affirmed, in so far as its findings agree with those of this decision, and is reversed, in so far as they do not. No special finding is made regarding the costs of both instances. So ordered.
