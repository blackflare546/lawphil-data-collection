BAUTISTA ANGELO, 
J.
:


On September 17, 1949, as a result of a labor dispute had between the San Miguel Brewery, Inc. and National Labor Union and Sambela (Case No. 271-V), the Court of Industrial Relations rendered a decision decreeing, among other things, that the company should not effect any dismissal, suspension or transfer except for just cause.


On April 4, 1950, the company dismissed from its service one Macario Borile, an affiliate of said labor union and, as a consequence of his dismissal, Borile filed a motion in said case alleging that he was dismissed without just cause in violation of the aforesaid decision and prayed that he be reinstated with backpay from April 4, 1950, the date of his dismissal. The company filed a written opposition on October 7, 1950 denying that Borile was dismissed without just cause or for his union activities and alleging that his dismissal was for a just cause.


On September 11, 1953, the court, through Judge V. Jimenez Yanzon, rendered a decision the dispositive part of which reads:




Wherefore, the Court decides this case according to the tenor and dispositions hereinabove stated: Hence, the motion to reinstate Macario Borile to his former position with backpay to be based on his separation pay in lieu of notice as mentioned in Exhibit ""D"" is hereby granted but his backpay is to be counted from April 4, 1950 up to August 27, 1952 the date when this case was submitted for decision;
 Provided, 
however, that a total of eight (8) months covering the periods of his two (2) suspensions be deducted therefrom. And finally, there being no proof that Macario Borile was dismissed by the company for his union activities, the prayer for contempt is hereby denied.




On September 21, 1953, the company filed a motion for reconsideration but the court
 in banc 
affirmed the decision in a resolution entered on January 19, 1954. This resolution was penned by Judge V. Jimenez Yanson and concurred in by Judges Bautista and Lanting. Judges Roldan and Castillo dissented in separate opinions, so that, as it appears, the original decision stands affirmed by a vote of 2 to 3 .From both the decision as well as the resolution affirming it, the company filed the present petition for review.


The pertinent portions of the decision of Judge V. Jimenez Yanson. which bears the affirmative vote of two other members of the trial court, which need to be considered in connection with this petition for review read as follows:


For a better understanding of this issue in this case, we reproduce hereunder the letter of Mr. J. B. Preysler, vice-president of the San Miguel Brewery, Inc., addressed to Macario Borile, enumerating the causes for his discharge:

Dear Sir:


In view of the fact that your services have proved unsatisfactory, we regret to inform you that we have to dispense with your services as member of our Security Force effective April 4, 1950. In lieu of notice, you will be allowed an extra compensation equivalent to one month salary.


Our action in your case is the culmination of a series of irregularities that you have committed and which we enumerate hereunder:


1. On March 21, 1950, at about 2:00 p.m., while on duty at the Magnolia compound from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. you left the said compound with any permission from your superior officers carrying with you the Corporation's pistol which, as you know should be used only inside the San Miguel Brewery compound and its subsidiaries and should not be taken outside;


2. On January 24, 1950, you also abandoned your post at the Magnolia compound without permission from your security officer;


3. On December 14, 1950, you conducted yourself in a manner so unbecoming a police officer in connection with the scandal made by your two paramours inside the premises of the San Miguel Brewery compound;


4. On September 17, 1949, you made a false report by stating that you were on your tour of duty as an inspector, when in fact, you witnessed the Tirso-Marino fight at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. Your presence thereat was confirmed by two officials of the Company who had seen you in the stadium on the night in question.


In view of all the foregoing circumstances, and in order to maintain the efficiency of our Security Force, we have no other recourse but to separate you from the service. 






Yours truly, 


SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC. 


J. P. PREYSLER
