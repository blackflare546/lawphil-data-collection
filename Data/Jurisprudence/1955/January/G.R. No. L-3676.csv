The Court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint with cost against the plaintiff. She has appealed. 


In 
Caoile vs. Yu Chiao,
 49 Off. Gaz., 4321;
 Talento vs. Makiki,
 49 Off. Gaz., 4331;
 Bautista vs. Uy 
49 Off. Gaz., 4331;
 Rellosa vs. Gaw Chee,
 49 Off. Gaz., 4345
 and Mercado vs. Go Bio
, 49 Off. Gaz., 5360, the majority of this Court has ruled that in Sales of real estate to aliens incapable of holding title thereto by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution 
1
 both the vendor and the vendee are deemed to have committed the constitutional violation and being thus 
in pari delicto
 the courts will not afford protection to either party.
2
 From this ruling three Justices dissented.
3


The action is not of rescission because it is not postulated upon any of the grounds provided for in Article 1291 of the old Civil Code and because the action of rescission involves lesion or damage and seeks to repair it. It is an action for annulment under Chapter VI, Title II, Book II, on nullity of contracts, based on a defect in the contract which invalidates it independently of such lesion or damages. 
4
 It is very likely that the majority of this Court proceeded upon that theory when it applied the
 in pari delicto
 rule referred to above. 


In the United States the rule is that in a sale of real estate to an alien disqualified to hold title thereto the vendor divests himself of the title to such real estate and has no recourse against the vendee despite the latter's disability on account of alienage to hold title to such real estate and the vendee may hold it against the whole except as against the State. It is only the State that is entitled by proceedings in the nature of 
office found
 to have a forfeiture or escheat declared against the vendee who is incapable of holding title to the real estate sold and conveyed to him.
5


However, if the State does not commence such proceedings and in the meantime the alien becomes naturalized citizen the State is deemed to have waived its right to escheat the real property and the title of the alien thereto becomes lawful and valid as of the date of its conveyance or transfer to him. 
6
 
The Rule in the United States that in a sale of real estate to an alien disqualified to hold title thereto, the vendor divests himself of the title to such real estate and is not permitted to sue for the annulment of his contract, is also the rule under the Civil Code. * * *Article 1302 of the old Civil Code provides: * * *Persons 
sui juris
 cannot, however, avail themselves of the incapacity of those with whom they contracted; * * *."".


Manresa's comment on this clause of article 1302 of the Civil Code is as follows:.




Irresponsabilidad del defecto alegada
.— Es la segunda de las condiciones necesarias para el ejercicio de la accion. Algunos la expresan diciendo que solo puede intrenar aquella el perjudicado, pero esta expresion puede conducir a ideas equivocadas, ya quela nulidad es independiente de la lesion, como declara el art. 1.300, y es licito al favorecido economicamente por el contrato pedir la nulidad basandose en causas a el no imputables, y en cambio no autoriza la ley el caso inverso. 


Sencilla la regla contenida en el parrafo segundo de este articulo,puede complicarse cuando coexisten dos defectos del contrato, comopuede suceder, derivandose a veces de un mismo hecho, verbigracia,el contrato celebrado con un incapaz por quien ignora que lo es: eneste ejemplo es indudable que la persona capaz no podra pedir lanulidad fundado en la incapacidad de la otra, pero si alegar elerror o el dolo que padeciera si las circunstancias del sujetoeran de decisiva influencia en el contrato. (
Supra
, pp.709-709.).




Appellant argues that if at the time of the conveyance of the real property the appellee was incapable of holding title to such real estate, the contract of sale was null or void and may be annulled, and his subsequent naturalization as a Filipino citizen cannot retroact to the date of the conveyance to make it lawful and valid. However, if the ban on aliens from acquiring not only agricultural but also urban lands, as construed by this Court in the Krivenko case, is to preserve the nation's lands for future generations of Filipinos, that aim or purpose would not be thwarted but achieved by making lawful the acquisition of real estate by aliens who became Filipino citizens by naturalization. The title to the parcel of land of the vendee, a naturalized Filipino citizen, being valid that of the domestic corporation to which the parcel of land has been transferred, must also be valid, 96.67 per cent of its capital stock being owned by Filipinos. 	 


The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without costs. 


Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, and Labrador, JJ.,
 concur.




Separate Opinions


REYES, J.B.L., 
J., 
concurring:.


I fully concur with the opinion of Justice Padilla, but wish to stress, as an additional reason for the decision in the present case, that when this action was instituted in 1948, the disability of the original vendee had been already removed, since he was naturalized in 1941; and that the stockholders of the second transferee, Li Seng Giap & Sons, Inc., who hold more than 60 per cent of its capital stock, had likewise become Filipino citizens before, and not after, the action to annul was filed.
