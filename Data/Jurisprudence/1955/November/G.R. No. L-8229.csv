Thereupon, the defendant waived the reading of the information as lastly amended, and manifested that he was already informed of the contents of the same, and that he pleaded guilty thereto. (CFI Decision, 1st Par.)


Thereupon, the Court of First Instance of Manila, presided over by Hon. Gregorio Narvasa, Judge, rendered the decision aforementioned, from which the Government has appealed. The questions raised for our determination are:


1.	May the prosecution appeal from the aforesaid decision of the lower court, upon the ground that defendant-appellee Luis Taruc should have been sentenced to a more severe penalty than that meted out therein?


2.	In the affirmative case, what penalty should be imposed upon said defendant-appellee?


The first question has already been settled by this Court in cases G.R. Nos. L-6687-6688 entitled
 People vs. Ang Cho Kio
.
 * 
"" The defendant in said cases was charged with murder, in one case, and with grave coercion with murder, in another case. Having pleaded guilty to both charges, the lower court sentenced him, in the first case, to an indeterminate penalty ranging from 12 years of 
prision mayor
 to 20 years of 
reclusion temporal
, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6,000, and to pay the costs; and, in the second case, to life imprisonment, with indemnity in the sum of P6,000 and costs. The prosecution appealed from the decision thus rendered, upon the theory that the defendant should have been sentenced, in the first case, to life imprisonment and, in the second case, to the extreme penalty. In dismissing the appeal, we said:


¿Puede el ministerio fiscal apelar?


El articulo 2 de la Regla 118 dice asi:


Quien puede apelar
. — El Pueblo de Filipinas, sin embargo, no podra apelar cuando el acusado se viese expuesto a doble 
Jeopardy
. En todos los demas casos, cualquiera de las partes podra apelar de una sentencia definitiva o de auto dictado despues de la sentencia que afecte los derechos esenciales del apelante.


Este articulo es reproduccion de los articulos 43 y 44 de la Orden General No. 58 tal como fue emendada por el articulo 4 de la Ley No. 22886. La Orden General No. 58 es de origen americano y, por eso, los precedentes anglo-americanos deben tenerse muy en cuenta.


En una larga lista de decisiones despues de decidida en casacion la causa de Kepner 
contra
 Estados Unidos, 195 U. S. 100; 11 Jur. Fil., 689, se ha establecido, invariablemente por este Tribunal la doctrina de que la acusacion no puede apelar 
contra
 una sentencia en que se absuelve al acusado, por la razon de que por segunda vez se le pone en peligro de ser castigado por el mismo delito. ""El derecho comun americano prohibia tambien un segundo juicio por el mismo delito hubiera el acusado sufrido o no algun castigo, o sido absuelto o condenado en una causa anterior.""


En la causa de Estados Unidos 
contra
 Sanges, citada en la de Kepner, se dijo: 'Desde la epoca del Lord Hale hasta la fecha del caso de Chadwick que acabamos de citar, los libros de texto, con raras excepciones, o dan por supuesto o afirman que el acusado, (o su representante), es el unico que puede obtener un nuevo juicio o recurrir en casacion en causa criminal, y una sentencia en su favor es definitiva y concluyente. (Veanse 2 Hawk., c. 47, sec. 12; c. 50, secciones 10 y siguientes; Bac. Ab. Trial, L. 9; Error, B; 1 Chit, Crim. Law, 657, 747; Stark. Crim. Pl. Segunda Edicion 357, 367, 371; Archb. Crim. Pl., (Duodecima Edicion Inglesa y Edicion sexta americana) 177, 199, Segunda Edicion, 357, 367, 371; Archb. Crim. P. I.)


. . . ""No se ha dado ningun caso de recurso de casacion 
contra
 una sentencia en favor del acusado, despues de absuelto."" (Archbold Cr. Pl & Pr., Pomeroy's Ed., 199.)


No error, however flagrant, committed by the court against the estate, can be reserved by it for decision by the supreme court when the defendant has once been placed in 
jeopardy
 and discharged, even though the discharge was the result of the error committed. (State
 vs. 
Rook, 49 L. R. A. 186, 61 Kan. 3822, 59 Pac. 653. (1 L. R. A. 242.)


Este Tribunal nunca ha resuelto una cuestion parecida a la causa presente en que el acusado fue condenado por una pena menor que la señalada por la ley y el ministerio fiscal, en apelacion, pide que de acuerdo con el Codigo Penal Revisado, se imponga al acusado una pena mayor. Si el fiscal — como el acusado — puede apelar para corregir un error de ley, entonces sera forzoso imponer al acusado la pena de reclusion perpetua. Despues de haber sido ya — por error — condenado or el tribunal inferior a la pena de 12 años de 
prision mayor
 a 20 años de 
reclusion temporal
, ¿no es poner otra vez al acusado en peligro de ser condenado a mayor pena por el mismo delito? Si el acusado fuese el apelante, no tendria derecho a quejarse si se le impusiera una pena mayor; en el caso presente el que apela es el ministerio fiscal, y dicha apelacion pone en peligro al acusado de recibir otra condena mayor. Creemos que en el caso presente se pone al acusado en doble 
jeopardy
, esto es, en el peligro de recibir la condena de
 reclusion perpetua 
despues de haber sido condenado ya por el juzgado inferior a una pena menor. Por este peligro, el ministerio fiscal no puede apelar, de acuerdo con el articulo 2 de la Regla 118 y siguiendo la garantia constitucional de que 'No se pondra a una persona en peligro de ser castigada dos veces por la misma infraccion' o en 
jeopardy
.


The prosecution in the case at bar urges a reexamination of the question decided in the Ang Cho Kio cases and a reconsideration of the view therein expressed by this Court. To our mind, however, the reasons advanced by the Solicitor General in support of his pretense are not sufficiently weighty to warrant a reversal of said view which is a mere corollary of the practice established in the Philippines and in the United States, for so long a time as to form part and parcel, not merely of the settled jurisprudence, but, also, of the constitutional law, in both jurisdictions.


Inasmuch as the prosecution cannot appeal from the decision against herein defendant-appellee, the propriety of the penalty therein meted out to him is beyond our power to review.


Wherefore, the appeal is dismissed, without special pronouncement as to costs. It is so ordered.
