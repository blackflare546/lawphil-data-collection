PADILLA, 
J.:


This is an action to annul the marriage entered into by and between Leoncio Cardenas and Florencia Rinen upon the ground that when said marriage was entered into on April 1948, the plaintiff to whom he had been married on 10 July 1927 was still alive.


In their answer the defendants plead that they have no knowledge or information as to the marriage performed by Minister George W. Wright on 10 July 1927 uniting Leoncio Cardenas and Eulogia Bigornia as husband and wife, nor as to the authority of the minister to solemnize the marriage; tha Leoncio Cardenas and Eulogia Bigornia lived together for sometime, he believing that he and she had a common home; that the defendant Florencia Rinen married Leoncio Cardenas in the honest belief and conviction that both parties were capable of entering into a valid marriage. Upon these allegations they pray that the complaint be dismissed with costs.


On the date set for the hearing of the case the parties submitted the following stipulation of facts:
