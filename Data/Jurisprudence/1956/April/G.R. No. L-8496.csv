LABRADOR, 
J.
:


This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, dismissing plaintiff's complaint. The facts alleged in the complaint are:


Plaintiff occupies the two door of an 
accesssoria
 situated on Misericordia Street belonging to the defendant. Plaintiff was an old lease, and upon the reconstruction of the building defendant allowed him to occupy the two doors beginning July 15, 1953, without fixing any definite amount of rent, except that it was to be the same as what other lessees have been to pay P300 for each door, or P600 for both, which is the rent paid by another lessee occupying better quarters, but as defendant could not make up his mind as to the amount of rent, it was agreed upon between them that plaintiff should deposit the sum of P1,000, which shall be applied for the payment of the rents from the month of January, 1954. From that time on, plaintiff had been offering a monthly rental of P600 for both doors, but defendant refused to accept this offer. On April 2, 1954, defendant demanded the payment of P700 as monthly rental from January 1, 1954. As the plaintiff is not willing to pay his rent and he fears that defendant would bring an action of unlawful detainer to eject him and to recover said rents for the premises plaintiff had been depositing the monthly sum of P600 a month as rentals, first with the defendant, later with the court. On the basis of the above facts, plaintiff prays that the court fixed a monthly rental of the premises at P600 beginning January 1, 1954, and that he be authorized to continue occupying said premises.


The complaint is dated August 23, 1954, but was filed on August 27, 1954. The defendant promptly presented a motion to dismiss, alleging that plaintiff's action is one of consignation, which is not the proper remedy, because the question involved should be decided in an action of forcible entry and unlawful detainer under Rule 72 of the Rules of Court, citing in support of his contention the case of Pue, et al. vs. Gonzales,
*
 G.R. No. L-2554-56 promulgated July 21, 1959. before the court could pass upon this motion to dismiss, counsel for defendant notified the court that on August 28, 1954, he had filed civil case No. 22492 against plaintiff herein for ejectment in the Municipal Court of Manila. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, alleging that his action was for the determination of the rental to be paid by him. After hearing the arguments the court dismissed the action on the ground that the question of the rentals will necessarily be involved in the pending action for ejectment. Nobody can force another to let the latter lease his property if the owner refuses. So the owner may not be compelled by action to give his property for lease to another.


Hence, plaintiff herein can not bring an action or has no cause against defendant. In procedured terms, there has been no violation of any right or breach of any duty of the defendant. As a matter of fact, plaintiff alleges that he had asked defendant to fix the rent and the latter fixed it at P700. If there has been a violation of any right at all, it is the plaintiff who has committed it in insisting to continue in the premises when he is not willing to pay the rents fixed by the owner.


The case of Pue, et al. vs. Gonzales, 
supra
, has been cited by the defendant-appellee between the plaintiff and the defendant should be treshed out in the ejectment case which the defendant instituted. In that case, we held thru Mr. Justice Montemayor:




Consignation in court under Art. 1176, is not the proper proceedings to determine the relation between landlord and tenant, the period of life the of the lease of tenancy, the reasonableness of the amount of rental, the right of tenant to keep the premises against the will of the landlord, etc. These questions should be decided in a case of ejectment or detainer . . . under the provisions of Rule 72 of the Rules of Court. In a case of ejectment, the landlord claims either that the lease has ended or been terminated or that the lease has forfeited his right as such or because of his failure to pay the rents as agreed upon or because he failed to refused to pay the new rentals fixed and demanded by the lessor. The lessee in his turn may put up the defense that according to law, the rental fixed and demanded to him is unreasonable, exorbitant and illegal. . . We repeat that all these questions should be submitted and decided in a case of ejectment and cannot be decided in a case of consignation.




The principle above quoted exactly covers the point at issue, i.e., that the disagreement between a lessor and a lessee as to the amount in an action of consignation but in that of forcible entry and unlawful detainer that the lessor institutes when the lessee refuses to pay the lessor the rents that he has fixed for the property. It may also be added that the consignation is proper when there is a debt to be paid, which the debtor desires to pay and which the creditor to receive, or neglects to receive, or cannot receive by reasons of his absence. The purpose of consignation is to have the obligation or indebtedness extinguished. In the case at bar, plaintiff seeks to have the obligation determined and fixed, hence this action should not be one of consignation.


For the foregoing considerations, we hold that plaintiff has no cause of action against defendant under the facts alleged in his complaint; that consignation is not the proper remedy; that it is the defendant who has the right or cause of action against the plaintiff because the latter refuses to pay the rents fixed but does not leave the property; and that if the plaintiff claims that the amount of rents demanded by the defendant is unreasonable and he desires to have it fixed judicially, he may set forth the above facts as defense in the action of ejectment filed by the defendant against him. The judgment of dismissal is hereby affirmed, with costs against the plaintiff-appellant.
