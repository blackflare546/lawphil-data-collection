RAMON DIOKNO,
 plaintiff-appellant,

vs.


REHABILITATION FINANCE CORPORATION,
 defendant-appellee.


Sixto de la Costa for appellee.


LABRADOR, 
J.
:


Plaintiff is the holder of a backpay certificate of indebtedness issued by the Treasurer of the Philippines under the provisions of Republic Act No. 304 of a face value of P75,857.14 dated August 30, 1948. On or about November 10, 1050, when the action was brought, he had an outstanding loan with the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, contracted therewith on January 27, 1950, in the total sum of P50,000, covered by a mortgage on his property situated at 44 Alhambra, Ermita, Manila, with interest at 4 per cent per annum, of which P47,355.28 was still unpaid. In this action he seeks to compel the defendant corporation to accept payment of the balance of his indebted with his backpay certificate. The defendant resists the suit on the ground that plaintiffs' demand is not only not authorized by section 2 of Republic Act No. 304 but contrary to the provisions thereof, and furthermore because plaintiff's loan was obtain on January 27, 1950, much after the passage of Republic Act No. 304, and because the law permits only ""acceptance or discount of backpay certificates,"" not the repayment of loans. The court
 a quo
 held that section 2 of Republic Act No. 304 is permissive merely, and that even if where mandatory, plaintiff's case can not fall thereunder because he is not acquiring property for a home or construing a residential house, but compelling the acceptance of his backpay certificate to pay a debt he contracted after the enactment of Republic Act No. 304. It, therefore, dismissed the complaint with costs.


The appeal involves the interpretation of section 2 of Republic Act No. 302, which provides:




. . . 
And provided, also
, That investment funds or banks or other financial institutions owned or controlled by the Government shall, subject to the availability of loanable funds, and any provision of the their charters, articles of incorporation's, by-laws, or rules and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, accept or discount at not more than 
two per centum per annum 
for ten years such certificate for the following purposes only: (1) the acquisition of real property for use as the applicant's home, or (2) the building or construction of the residential house of the payee of said certificate: . . . 




It is first contended by the appellant that the above provision is mandatory, not only because it employs the word ""shall"", which in its ordinary signification is mandatory, not permissive, but also because the provision is applicable to institutions of credit under the control of the Government, and because otherwise the phrases ""subject to availability of loanable funds"" and ""any provisions of this charter, . . . and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding"" would be superfluous.


It is true that its ordinary signification the word ""shall"" is imperative.




In common or ordinary parlance, and in its ordinary signification, the term ""shall"" is a word of command, and one which has always or which must be given compulsory meaning; as denoting obligation. It has a preemptory meaning, and it is generally imperative or mandatory. It has the invariable significance of operating to impose a duty which may be enforced, particularly if public policy is in favor of this meaning or when addressed to public officials, or where a public interest is involved, or where the public or persons have rights which ought to be exercised or enforced, unless a contrary intent appears. People 
vs.
 O'Rourke, 13 P. 2d. 989, 992, 124 Cal. App. 752. (39 Words and Phrases, Permanent Ed., p. 90.)


The presumption is that the word ""shall"" in a statute is used is an imperative, and not in a directory, sense. If a different interpretation is sought, it must rest upon something in the character of the legislation or in the context which will justify a different meaning.

vs.
 People's Nat. Bank of Lawrenceburg, 89 N. E. 904, 905 44 Ind. App. 578. (39 Words and Phrases, Permanent Ed., p. 93.)




However, the rule is not absolute; it may be construed as ""many"", when so required by the context or by the intention of the statute.




In the ordinary signification, ""shall"" is imperative, and not permissive, though it may have the latter meaning when required by the context. Town of Milton 
vs.
 Cook, 138 N.E. 589, 590, 244 Mass. 93. (39 Words and Phrases, Permanent Ed., p. 89.)


""Must"" or ""shall"" in a statute is not always imperative, but may be consistent with an exercise of discretion. In re O'Hara, 82 N.Y.S. 293, 296, 40 Misc. 355, citing In re Thurber's Estate, 162 N.Y. 244, 252, 56 N.E. 638, 639. (
Ibid
. p. 92.)


The word ""shall"" is generally regarded as imperative, but in some context it is given a permissive meaning, the intended meaning being determined by what is intended by the statute. National Transit Corporation Co. 
vs.
 Boardman, 197 A. 239, 241, 328, Pa. 450.


The word ""shall"" is to be construed as merely permissive, where no public benefit or private right requires it to be given an imperative meaning Sheldon 
vs.
 Sheldon, 134 A. 904, 905, 100 N.J. Ex. 24.


Presumption is that word ""shall"" in ordinance, is mandatory; but, where it is necessary to give effect to legislative intent, the word will be construed as ""may."" City of Colorado Springs 
vs.
 Street, 254 p. 440, 441, 81 Colo. 181.


The word ""shall"" does not necessarily indicate a mandatory behest. 
Grimsrud vs. Johnson,
 202 N. W. 72, 73, 162 Minn. 98.


Words like ""may,"" ""must,"" ""shall"" etc., are constantly used in statutes without intending that they shall be taken literally, and in their construction the object evidently designed to be reached limits and controls the literal import of the terms and phrases employed. Fields 
vs.
 United States, 27 App. D. C. 433, 440. (39 Words and Phrases, Permanent Ed., 89, 92).




In this jurisdiction the tendency has been to interpret the word ""shall"" as the context or a reasonable construction of the statute in which it is used demands or requires. Thus the provision of section 11 of Rule 4 of the Rules requiring a municipal judge or a justice of the peace to render judgment of the conclusion of the trial has been held in the directory. (Alejandro 
vs.
 Judge of First Instance
1
 40 Off. Gaz., 9th Supp., 261). In like manner section 178 of the Election Law, in so far a it requires that appeals shall be decided in three months, has been to the directory for the Court of Appeals. (Querubin 
vs.
 The Court of Appeals,
2
 46 Off. Gaz., 155).


In the provision subject controversy, it is to be noted that the verb-phrase ""shall accept or discount"" has two modifiers, namely, ""subject to availability of loanable funds"" and ""at not more that two per centum per annum for ten years."" As to the second modifier, the interest to be charged, there seems to be no question that the verb phrase is mandatory, because not only does the law use ""at not more"" but the legislative purpose and intent, to conserve the value of the backpay certificate for the benefit of the holders, for whose benefit the same have been issued, can be carried out by fixing a maximum limit for discounts. But as to when the discounting or acceptance shall be made, the context and the sense demand a contrary interpretation. The phrase ""subject"" means ""being under the contingency of"" (Webster's Int. Dict.) a condition. If the acceptance or discount of the certificates to be ""subject"" to the condition of the availability of a loanable funds, it is evident that the Legislature intended that the acceptance shall be allowed on the condition that there are ""available loanable funds."" In other words, acceptance or discount is to be permitted only if there are loanable funds.


Let us now consider the meaning of the condition imposed for accepting or discounting certificates, the ""availability of loanable funds."" On this issue the appellant contends that the mere fact that P50,000 was loaned to him and that the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation has been granting loans up to the time plaintiff offered to pay the loan with his certificate — these prove that there are ""available loanable funds"". As the court 
a quo 
did not pass on such availability, he also contends that this is a question of fact to be determined by the courts. The defendant denies the existence of ""available loanable funds."" The gist of plaintiffs' contention is that any and all funds of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation are subject to the provision of the discount or acceptance of the certificates; that of defendant-appellee is that only funds made available for the purpose of discounting backpay certificates may be used for such purpose and that at the time the action was filed there was no such funds.


The Rehabilitation Finance Corporation was created by Republic Act No. 85, which was approved on October 29, 1946. The corporation was created ""to provide credit facilities for the rehabilitation and development of agriculture, commerce, and industry, the reconstruction of property damaged by war, and the broadening and diversification of the national economy"" (section 1), and to achieve the above aims it was granted the following powers:




SEC. 2. 
Corporate powers
. — The Rehabilitation Finance Corporation shall have the power:


(

(
b

(
