JOHNSON,

dissenting: 


An appeal from a judgment of the Honorable Charles H. Burritt, judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu. 


Judgment 
should be affirmed
. 


This was an action against the defendants for the return of sixty-five logs, or their value, estimated at P1,250 and damages estimated at P225 and costs. 


On the 9th of May, 1905, the plaintiff presented the following complaint: 




The plaintiff sets forth: 


1.	That, in the month of March, 1905, the plaintiff was the owner of sixty-five logs or pieces of timber, deposited on the beach of the city of Cebu. 


2.	That on the said date the defendant, Juan Climaco, was the governor and sheriff, duly elected and qualified, of the Province of Cebu and still, at the present time, such governor and sheriff. 


3.	That in the same month of March, 1906 [1905], the defendant, Tan Bun Jua, was the plaintiff in a civil case then pending in the municipal court of Cebu, in which case one Manuel Chiong Tiqui was the defendant, and in the same month judgment was rendered in favor of the said plaintiff against the said Manuel Chiong Tiqui for a sum of more than P400. 


4.	In the same month of March, 1905, the defendant, Juan Climaco, in his capacity of governor and sheriff of the Province of Cebu, sold the plaintiff's aforementioned logs to the defendant, Diego Cabrera. 


5.	That said sale was held without the formalities required by law and at public auction in the office of the clerk of this court; that said sale was illegal and was effected to the petition and instigation of the defendant, Tan Bu Juan, under the pretext of complying with the writ of execution issued by the justice of the peace of the municipality of Cebu, in the case aforementioned. 


6.	That said sale was null and illegal and the plaintiff has been injured thereby in the sum of P250. 


7.	That the value of the said logs, sold as aforestated, was P1,250. 


8.	That the defendant, Diego Cabrera, took possession of the said logs on the same date of the sale and up to the present time still retains possession of them and unlawfully refuses to deliver them retains possessions of them and unlawfully refuses to deliver them to the plaintiff, who is their true owner. 


9.	That, by reason of the illegal acts of the defendants before named, the plaintiff has suffered injury and damage in the amount of P225. 


10.	That, therefore, the plaintiff asks that judgment be rendered against the defendant for the return of the sixty-five logs aforementioned, or, in case it be impossible to return them that the defendants be sentenced to pay the sum of P1,250 as an indemnity, the sum of P225 as losses and damages, and the costs of the trial; and for any further remedy that justice may require.




On the 19th of May, 1905, the plaintiff amended the foregoing complaint, as follows: 




The plaintiff sets forth: 


1	That he ratifies his previous complaint in all its parts, except the allegation that the said timbers are now in the possession of the defendant Diego Cabrera, and further alleges: 


That, on May 1, 1905, the defendant Diego Cabrera illegally sold and transferred the logs described in the complaint, to the defendant, the Chinaman Quina, who now has them and unlawfully refuses to deliver them to the plaintiff. 


Therefore, the plaintiff prays that judgment be rendered against the defendant for the return of the 65 logs aforementioned, or, in case it be impossible to return them, that the defendant be sentenced to pay the sum of P1,250 as an indemnity, the sum of P225 as losses and damages, and the costs of the trial; and for any further remedy that justice may require.




On the 10th of November, 1905, the defendant, Juan Climaco, filed the following answer: 




Juan Climaco, one of the defendants in the above-entitled case, in answer to the complaint filed therein, denies each and all of the allegations contained therein, and as his special defense, alleges: 


That, as governor of the Province of Cebu, he is the chief executive officer of the courts of the justices of the peace of the said province, in accordance with Act No. 136, and, as such officer, duly officiated in the case in which Tan Bunjua is the plaintiff and Chiong Tiqui the defendant, in compliance with a writ of execution addressed to him by the justice of the peace of the municipality of Cebu, which writ was and is authentic and legal, as shown by the attached copy thereof, marked Exhibit A; and that the proceedings carried out the defendant Juan Climaco, as governor of Cebu, and by his authorized deputies, are legal and are within the said defendant's powers as such chief executive officer. 


Therefore, he respectfully prays the court to absolve him from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.




Exhibit A. to which reference is made in the answer of the defendant, is as follows: 




EXHIBIT A. 


WRIT OF EXECUTION. 


To the governor of the Province of Cebu and 

his authorized deputies, greetings: 


We are that out of the personal property of the Chinaman Chiong Tiqui, a resident of Calle Felipe II of this municipality of Cebu, you collect the sum of P498, as debt and damages, with interest thereon from the date of this execution until the date of payment, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum; and the sum of P5.60, for the costs of the trial assessed in this justice of the peace court of the municipality of Cebu, on March 14, 1905, in the cause against the Chinaman Tiqui for the payment of a debt and damages, interest and costs; and that you deliver the said sums to the Chinaman Tan Bunjua, the plaintiff with the exception of your legitimate fees for the execution, and, finally, that you make return to this court within the term provided by law of the execution of this writ, recording on the back hereof the proceedings had.

Cebu, November 11, 1905. 




JUAN CLIMACO,


Governor of Cebu and Sheriff ex officio.








After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for the return of the sixty-five logs or the payment of the sum of P1,235, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent, from the 9th of May, 1905, and costs. 


From this judgment of the lower court the defendants appealed and made the following assignments of error: 




I. 


The court erred in finding that the 65 pieces of timber which were attached and sold by the deceased Juan Climaco in his capacity of sheriff, belonged to the plaintiff, and not to Chionco Tiqui. 


II. 


The lower court also erred in finding that the sale made by the sheriff of the aforesaid 65 pieces of timber, was a private sale by the sheriff and not a judicial sale or one by judicial order. 


III. 


The lower court likewise erred in finding that the sale at public auction of the said pieces of timber was null and illegally made by the sheriff, Juan Climaco. 


IV. 


Finally, the lower court erred in finding the sheriff, Juan Climaco, liable for the sale made at public auction of the logs claimed, and in sentencing him to pay, jointly with his codefendants, to the plaintiff the sum stated in the judgment; and the said court also erred in denying the motion for a new hearing, presented by the said defendant sheriff.




During the trial of the cause in the court below the plaintiff presented three witnesses. The first was the plaintiff himself; the second was Pantaleon E. del Rosario. The said Rosario in an attorney at law, and deputy sheriff of the Province of Cebu. The third witness was Quintan Chiong.

The timbers remained in the same place where they were delivered to me at Lutag from the month of August, 1904, up until sometime in the month of April or May, 1905, when upon passing through the sitio of Lutag where the timbers were deposited I found several laborers at work on these timbers. Upon inquiring of them what they were doing and why they were working on those timbers, they informed me that they were taking the timbers away by order of Juan Quina. I asked them ""why they were taking my timbers away;"" and they answered, ""because the Chinaman Juan Quina had brought them from Diego Cabrera.""

The agreement with the Chinaman Cheong Tique was: When the timbers should arrive from Dapitan, Mindanao, I was to pay him at the rate of ten pesos per piece, deducting therefrom the amount of the forestry tax which it was my obligation to pay according to the contract, depositing an amount to secure the payment of the forestry ta; which was carried into effect. The contract was made in the month of May and the Chinaman Cheong Tique went to Dapitan with the lorcha Prudencia for the purpose of bringing the timbers to Cebu, returning with them in the first days of August when the contract was carried into effect.

? — 


A.

. In effect the letters C. [and] Q. are a commercial mark which in trade means Chiong Tique.

During the trial the plaintiff offered in evidence the record in case No. 305 of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, in which Manuel Cheong Tique was plaintiff and Tan Bunjua and Juan Climaco were defendants. Said record was admitted without objection. 


From said record (No. 305) it appears that on the 15th of April, 1905, the plaintiff, Manuel Cheong Tique, who had been the defendant in the action upon which the execution in question was issued (the case of Tan Bunjua 
vs.
 Manuel Cheong Tique), commenced an action against Tan Bunjua and Juan Climaco for the purpose of having the judgment in the case of Tan Bunjua 
vs.
 Manuel Cheong Tique declared null and void, for the reason that he, Manuel Cheong Tique, had not been duly notified of the existence of said action and that said judgment was rendered against him without a hearing. The plaintiff, Manuel Cheong Tique also prayed that said sentence and execution be declared null and void. In this action (case No. 305) the defendant, Juan Climaco, made no appearance. 


After hearing the evidence, adduced during the trial, in cause No. 305 the lower court rendered a judgment decreeing that the sentence dictated by the justice of the peace, in the case of Tan Banjua 
vs.
 Manuel Cheong Tique was null and void and that the execution issued thereon, on the 25th of March, 1905, was also null and void; and the court issued an order restraining the sheriff, Juan Climaco, and his deputies, from executing the said execution. 


It was stipulated by the plaintiff and defendants that Exhibit A, attached to the answer of the defendant, Juan Climaco, correctly stated the facts relating to the execution and sale of the logs in question, as well as the return of the sheriff made in relation to the said sale. 


From the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause the following facts were fully proven and are not disputed: 


First. That the auxiliary justice of the peace of the municipality of Cebu, on the 14th of March, 1905, in an action then pending between Tan Bunjua, plaintiff, 
vs.
 Manuel Cheong Tique, defendant, rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P498 with costs. 


Second. That on the 25th of March, 1905, an execution was issued upon said judgment and was placed in the hands of the sheriff of said province, who, upon the 30th of March, levied upon the sixty-five logs which he found deposited in McClernand Street in the city of Cebu, which logs were sold at public auction in the office of the sheriff upon the 10th of April, 1905. 


Third. That the sixty-five logs in question belonged to and were owned by Nicolas Arbotante. 


Fourth. That the said Nicolas Arbotante who owned the said sixty-five logs, had no notice whatever of either the pendency of the action between Tan Bunjua and Manuel Cheong Tique, nor of the attachment or sale of the said sixty-five logs by the said sheriff, which sale took place in the office of the sheriff upon the 10th of April, 1905. 


Fifth. That the judgment of the justice of the peace rendered in the cause of Tan Bunjua 
vs.
 Manuel Cheong Tique was declared null and void by the judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu in an action (No. 305) commenced for that purpose on the 15th of April, 1905, which action (No. 305) was entitled Manuel Cheong Tique 
vs.
 Tan Bunjua and Juan Climaco, sheriff. The basis of this action was the fact that the defendant, Manuel Cheong Tique, had not been given a hearing in the cause of Tan Bunjua 
vs.
 Manuel Cheong Tique. Said action (305) was based upon the provisions of section 113 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions. Said section 113 provides: 




SEC. 113	
Relief from effect of judgments and orders
. — Upon such terms as may be just the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a judgment, order, or other proceedings taken against him through mistake, inadvertance, surprise, or excusable neglect: 
Provided
, That application therefor be made within a reasonable time, but 
in no case exceeding six months 
after such judgment, order or proceeding was taken.




The judgment in question rendered by the justice of the peace upon the 14th of March, 1905. The action (305) declaring null such judgment, was commenced on the 15th of April, 1905. 


Sixth. In the action (305) the court not only declared that the judgment of the justice of the peace in the case of Tan Bunjua 
vs.
 Manuel Cheong Tique was null and void, but also declared that the execution issued thereon was null and void. 


From the foregoing facts we have the following conclusions: 


That the defendant herein, Juan Climaco, as sheriff of the Province of Cebu, by virtue of authority of a writ of execution which was declared to be null and void, issued upon a judgment of the justice of the peace, which has also been declared null and void, levied upon property of the plaintiff, Nicolas Arbotante, and sold the same without his (Arbotante's) having had any notice whatever of said execution and sale. 


With reference to the first above assignment of error, the plaintiff proved beyond any peradventure of doubt that the said sixty-five logs belonged to him. The defendant presented no proof whatever even tending to show that the logs were not the property of the plaintiff. 


Under the second assignment of error, the appellant attempts to show that by reason of the fact that he levied upon the logs in question and sold them under an execution issued by the justice of the peace, that he was acting in a judicial capacity. This contention can not be admitted, but even if it were admitted, even then it would not be authority for the sheriff to sell the property of a third person. The execution commanded the sheriff to attach sufficient personal property belonging to the defendant, Manuel Cheong Tique, to satisfy said judgment. The execution afforded the defendant (the sheriff) no authority whatever to attach the property of another person, and when he attached the property of a third person, he violated the provisions of his order (the execution). The execution only afforded him protection when he complied with its terms, to wit, to levy upon the property of the persons mentioned therein. 


With reference to the third assignment of error, the defendant and appellant contends that his acts in levying upon and selling the logs in question were legal and valid. This contention certainly can not be maintained. The plaintiff herein, the owner of the logs in question, had had no hearing whatever with reference to the said sale. He had no notice of the execution and sale. He was deprived of his property without due process of law. 


Under the fourth assignment of error, the defendant and appellant (the sheriff) contends that inasmuch as the execution was levied upon the logs in question, and the same were sold by him in good faith, he should be relieved from all responsibility; in other words, the effect of the contention of the defendant and appellant (the sheriff) is that under a writ of execution issued by the court he may levy upon the property of any person whatsoever, and sell the same, without incurring any responsibility, so long as he acts in good faith. The lack of good faith is a fact difficult to prove. The execution was issued to the sheriff and he was directed to levy upon the property of Manuel Cheong Tique. He did not obey that order. Instead of levying upon the property of Manuel Cheong Tique, he levied upon and sold the property of Nicolas Arbotante. To sustain the good faith which he claims he exercised in said execution and sale he made no effort to show that he had made the slightest inquiry of the people living in and about the place where the logs were deposited, for the purpose of ascertaining who the real owner of the logs was. Certainly a sheriff in the execution of a writ of execution can claim no protection under said writ of execution, unless he can show that he obeyed its orders. In the present case he makes no pretense of having obeyed the writ of execution. 


An execution is an order to the sheriff to attach and sell the property of the judgment debtor. If he sells the property of another he is not obeying the order of the court. 


The officer has no authority to attach the property of any person except that of the defendant (judgment debtor). if he does so the writ affords him no justification, for the act is not obedience to its mandate. (Rhodes 
vs.
 Peterson, 3 Cal., 469; Van Pelt 
vs.
 Littler, 14 Cal., 194; Sanderson 
vs.
 Baker, 3 Wils., 309; State 
vs.
 Moore, 19 Mo., 369; Harris 
vs.
 Hanson, 11 Maine, 241; People 
vs.
 Schuyler, 4 N. Y., 173; State 
vs.
 Talom, 69 N. C., 35.)


If the sheriff takes the property of a third person he is entitled to no indulgence. The sheriff having misapplied his process, whether by mistake or design, will make no difference. He stands in the position of every trespasser and is liable to an action in the instant the trespass is committed. The circumstance that the property was in the possession of the execution debtor at the date of the judgment, amounts to nothing except proof of fraud. (Boulware 
vs.
 Craddock, 30 Cal., 190; Vose 
vs.
 Stickney, 8 Minn., 51; Dodge 
vs.
 Chandler, 9 Minn., 87; Rankin 
vs.
 Ekel, 64 Cal., 446.) 


The owner whose property has been taken under a writ of attachment, to which he was not a party, has his choice of remedies. He may sue in trespass or for the recovery of the property. (Yarborough 
vs.
 Harper, 32 Miss., 112; Gimble 
vs.
 Acklex, 12 Iowa, 27.) 


In the case of Forsythe 
vs.
 Ellis (4 J. J. Marshall (Ky.), 298) the chief justice, speaking for the court, said: 




The reason why the sheriff is responsible to the owner is a very comprehensive one and applies to all persons who take the property of others without any authority. An execution against the goods of A gives no authority to the sheriff to take the goods of B. So long as the officer confines his acts to the authority of the process he is irresponsible, but all acts which are not justified by the writ are, of course, without authority of law. The inevitable consequence, therefore, of the principle that no man shall touch the property of another without the permission of the owner or the sanction of the law, is that no plea of exemption or station, however exalted or consecrated, can exonerate a trespasser. This principle is conservative of property. Without its integrity and university, private rights would be insecure and the law would be unequal and tyrannical. The sovereign power of the State, with its ""eminent domain"" can not take from the humblest citizen a particle of his property for public use, without allowing him a just compensation. 


If an execution against one man would excuse the sheriff for taking and selling the property of another, every citizen would be at his mercy and none could call his estate his own. As the execution gives the sheriff no authority, he has none, and therefore his sale neither devises nor confers any rights. The owner of the property, therefore, sold by the sheriff without authority, may recover from the sheriff its value in an action of trespass.




Mr. Harlow, in his work on the liability of sheriffs, at section 562, says: 




An officer is liable to the owner of personal property for the seizure and sale thereof under an execution against a third party, and he is not relieved from liability by professing to sell only the ""right, title and interest"" of the defendant.




In the case of Boulware 
vs.
 Craddock (30 Cal., 190) the court said: 




If the sheriff, by virtue of an execution, seizes the property of a person other than the judgment debtor, whether by mistake or design, it is not necessary for the owner of the property thus seized to make a demand on the sheriff before commencing suit.




The defense is made for the defendant here (he does not make it for himself) that under section 451 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, he is not liable, even though he levies upon the sells the property of a third person, unless such third person should give him notice in writing and lay claim to the property which is being sold. We can not agree that said section 451 is subject to any such interpretation. We do not believe that section 451 was intended to protect a sheriff from all responsibility whatever where he sells the property of a third person under a writ of execution, where such third person fails to give him notice that the property being sold belongs to him. If that is the correct interpretation of said section 451, then we contend that that provision of said section is absolutely void under the provisions of the Philippine Bill, which provides that persons shall not be deprived of their property without due process of law. It being admitted in the present case that the property belonged to Nicolas Arbotante and that it was sold without his knowledge or consent, or without the slightest notice that the same was being levied upon and sold, 
we hold, that to justify the sheriff in said sale and to relieve him from all responsibility whatever, would constitute one of the most flagrant cases of depriving a man of his property without due process of law which could possibly come to the attention of the court
. 


The defendant and appellant makes no claim that section 451 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions relieves him of all responsibility. The defense is made for him. 


Section 451 is taken from section 689 of the California Code. So far as we have been able to discover the supreme court of California has not interpreted said section (689). In the case of Black 
vs.
 Clasby (97 Cal., 482) the supreme court of California referred to said section (689) but refused to discuss the effect of the same, for the reason that the action in that case arose prior to the time of the enactment of said provision. In that case, as they had done in many others, the supreme court of California said: 




When the sheriff, under a writ of attachment, or execution against one person, seizes the goods of another, which at the time of the seizure are in the custody either of the owner or of a person other than the defendant in the writ, he is a trespasser 
ab initio
, and no previous demand is necessary to authorize the recovery therefor.




In the case of Lammon 
vs.
 Feusier (111 U. S., 17) Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the Supreme Court of the United States said: 




The marshall (the officer corresponding to the sheriff), in serving a writ of attachment on mesne process, which directs him to take the property of that person, and of that person only; and to take only such property of his as is subject to be attached, and not property exempt by law from attachment. A neglect to take the attachable property of that person, and a taking, upon the writ, of the property of another person or of property exempt from attachment, are equally breaches of his official duty. The taking of the attachable property of the person named in the writ is rightful; the taking of the property of another person is wrongful. . . . 


A person other than the defendant named in the writ, whose property is wrongfully taken, may, indeed, sue the marshall, like any other wrongdoer, in an action of trespass, to recover damages for the wrongful taking; and neither the official character of the marshall, nor the writ of attachment, affords him any defense to such action. (Day 
vs.
 Gallup, 2 Wall., 97; Buck 
vs.
 Cobatch, 3 Wall., 334.)




For al the foregoing reasons, basing our judgment upon the facts and the law, we are of the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the lower should be affirmed with costs.
