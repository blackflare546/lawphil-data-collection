G.R. No. 5864           September 16, 1911


RAMON DOMINISAG,
 plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


MANUEL MANCILLA,
 defendant-appellant.


M. Legaspi Florendo, for appellant.

Pedro Ma. Sison, for appellee.


MORELAND, 
J.:


We affirm this judgment upon the opinion of the court below, laying special emphasis upon the fact that the defendant at the time he purchased the land in question knew the rights and interests of the plaintiff in and to the said land and had before him the instrument showing such interest in the plaintiff. Having this knowledge, he can not be said to be an innocent purchaser and he accordingly took subject to the rights of the plaintiff therein.


Torres, Mapa, Johnson and Carson, JJ.,
