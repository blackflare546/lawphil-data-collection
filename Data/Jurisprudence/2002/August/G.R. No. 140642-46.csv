vs.


ROMEO REYES 
y 
DEL ROSARIO,
 accused-appellant.


D E C I S I O N


PER CURIAM
:


This is an automatic review of the Decision, dated May 18, 1999, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12 of Malolos, Bulacan in Criminal Cases Nos. 1768-M-98 to 1772-M-98 finding accused-appellant Romeo Reyes guilty beyond reasonable doubt of five (5) counts of incestuous rape and imposing upon him the supreme penalty of death for each count.


Upon the complaint of his biological daughter, Theresa C. Reyes, five (5) informations were filed against accused-appellant. Except for the date of the commission of the crime and the age of the victim, the informations set forth similar allegations:


That sometime in the month of April 1994, in the municipality of Pulilan, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being the father of the offended party, Theresa C. Reyes, then a minor 10 years of age, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, by means of force and intimidation, with abuse of confidence and with lewd designs, have carnal knowledge of said Theresa C. Reyes, against her will and without her consent.


Contrary to law.
1 


In Criminal Case No. 1769-M-98, the information alleged that the rape was committed in May 1994 and the age of the victim was then ten (10) years old.
2 
 
In Criminal Case Nos. 1770-M-98 and 1771-M-98, the rapes were allegedly committed in June 1995 and September 1995, respectively, when Theresa was then eleven (11) years old.
3 
 
In Criminal Case No. 1772-M-98, the rape was allegedly committed in March 1996 when the victim was then twelve (12) years old.
4 


At his arraignment, accused-appellant, with the assistance of counsel, pleaded not guilty to each charge of rape. Trial ensued. The prosecution presented as its witnesses the victim, Theresa, her mother and wife of accused-appellant, Erlinda, the victim’s sister, Rodelia, and Dr. Manuel Aves.


Theresa was born on June 17, 1983
5 
 to accused-appellant and Erlinda. She was the youngest of the couple’s three (3) children. The family lived in Dampol 1st, Pulilan, Bulacan. Some time in April 1994, Theresa, then only ten (10) years old, was left alone in the house with accused-appellant. It was about 10:00 in the morning. Theresa was in the bedroom. Accused-appellant entered the room and made Theresa lie down. He removed her shorts and panty. He then inserted his right forefinger into her vagina. Theresa cried and told her father to stop but he just ignored her. Thereafter, he removed his forefinger from her vagina and lay on top of her. Accused-appellant then inserted his penis into Theresa’s sexual organ and ""made an up and down movement."" Theresa felt pain. She cried and told her father that she would tell her mother about what he did. Accused-appellant threatened to kill her and her mother if Theresa told on him.
6 


The second time that accused-appellant molested Theresa was some time in May 1994. Theresa was again left alone with accused-appellant in the house one morning. She was sleeping when accused-appellant came near her. He kissed Theresa on the lips. He pulled down her shorts and panty and lay on top of her. He unzipped his short pants and put out his then already hardened penis. Forthwith, accused-appellant inserted it into Theresa’s vagina and ""made an up and down movement."" Theresa cried. After her father was finished, Theresa went to the bathroom and washed her sexual organ. Theresa hated her father for what he did to her but she did not tell her mother about it because he again threatened to kill her and her mother.
7 


Theresa was sexually abused the third time by accused-appellant some time in June 1995
. 
As in the previous instances, only accused-appellant and Theresa were in the house at the time. Accused-appellant ordered her to lie down. Theresa at first refused to obey him but he threatened to kill her and her mother. When she lay down, accused-appellant placed himself on top of her. After removing her panty and unzipping his short pants, accused-appellant inserted his penis into Theresa’s vagina and made ""an up and down motion."" When he was done with her, accused-appellant warned Theresa against telling anyone about the incident. Theresa could not do anything but cry.
8 


The fourth instance of sexual abuse occurred some time in September 1995. Accused-appellant placed himself atop Theresa, who was then lying down. He immediately inserted his sexual organ into her vagina. He ""made an up and down movement."" Theresa again felt pain. She was very angry with her father but she could not tell anyone about it because he continued to threaten her.
9 


Some time in March 1996, accused-appellant molested Theresa for the fifth time. As in the other instances, accused-appellant and Theresa were then the only ones in the house. Accused-appellant made Theresa lie down and he placed himself on top of her. He removed her shorts. Theresa cried and pleaded to him to stop but her plea fell on deaf ears. Instead, accused-appellant proceeded to insert his penis into her vagina and ""made an up and down movement."" When accused-appellant was through, Theresa told him that she would inform her mother about the incident. Accused-appellant merely told Theresa, ""
sige bahala ka. Ikaw naman ang mapapahiya.
""
10 


Unable to endure it any longer, Theresa finally confided to her older sister, Rodelia, what their father had done to her. Rodelia was so mad at their father and chided Theresa for not telling her sooner. Rodelia decided to let their mother, Erlinda, know about it too. Thereafter, all three of them went to the police station to file a complaint against accused-appellant.
11 


Theresa categorically pointed to her father, accused-appellant, as her assailant during the course of her testimony in open court.


Rodelia testified that she is the older sister of Theresa and that accused-appellant is their father. Rodelia is already married and lives separately with her own family. On May 30, 1998, shortly after Rodelia arrived from Taiwan where she worked as an overseas contract worker, Theresa came to Rodelia’ s house and tearfully told the latter that she had been raped by accused-appellant several times. Rodelia’s heart went out to her younger sister as she embraced her. Rodelia mildly reproached Theresa saying, ""
kasi tinanong na kita hindi ka nagsalita sa akin
.""
12 


Rodelia already suspected that their father was abusing Theresa. Rodelia noticed that Theresa showed no respect to accused-appellant when she talked to him. Rodelia herself experienced being molested by accused-appellant when she was only eight (8) years old. Unlike with Theresa, however, accused-appellant was not successful in having sexual intercourse with Rodelia. Accused-appellant also threatened Rodelia that he would kill her if she told her mother that he tried to molest her (Rodelia). She averred that she felt no love for their father for what he did to her and Theresa.
13 


Erlinda is legally married to accused-appellant and the mother of the victim. On May 30, 1998, Theresa, with the help of her older sister, finally found the courage to tell her mother that accused-appellant raped her five (5)
 
times. Erlinda cried when she heard Theresa’s account of what happened. Together with Rodelia, Erlinda accompanied Theresa to the police station to file a complaint against accused-appellant.
14 


Upon the request of the local police, Dr. Aves examined Theresa on June 2, 1998. He conducted a genital examination on the victim and found that her hymen had multiple healed deep lacerations at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions. Dr. Aves concluded that Theresa was already in a ""non-virgin state"" resulting from more than one sexual intercourse. When he asked Theresa why she was no longer a virgin, she answered, ""
ginahasa ako.
""
 
She said it was her father who raped her.
15 


For his part, accused-appellant interposed the defense of denial and alibi. He testified that he is a tricycle driver and bread vendor. He is married to Erlinda and they have three (3) children: Rodelia, Martin and Theresa. He claimed that he was plying his route as tricycle driver during those instances mentioned by Theresa that he raped her. According to accused-appellant, Theresa accused him of raping her just to get back at him. She was allegedly angry with him as he always scolded her for being lazy. He denied having any knowledge about the five times that his youngest daughter was raped.
16 


After the prosecution and defense presented their respective evidence, the trial court rendered judgment finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping her daughter, Theresa, on five (5) different occasions and imposing on him five (5) death penalties. The dispositive portion of the trial court’s decision reads:


WHEREFORE, finding herein accused Romeo Reyes y del Rosario guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of rape as charged in each of the five (5)
 
informations in these five (5) cases, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the death penalty as the law so provides for each of said five (5) crimes of rape he committed against his own daughter, a minor under eighteen (18) years of age, to indemnify her in the total amount of P250,000.00 as actual damages, and to pay the costs of the proceedings.


Pursuant to Art. 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Sec. 22 of Republic Act No. 7659, let the records of these cases be forwarded to the Supreme Court for automatic review, ""within twenty (20) days but not earlier than fifteen (15) days after promulgation of the judgment or notice of denial of any motion for new trial or reconsideration.""


SO ORDERED.
17 


In his appeal brief, accused-appellant makes a lone assignment of error:


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT ROMEO REYES HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
18 


Accused-appellant assails the credibility of Theresa. Her testimony is allegedly not credible, unconvincing and contrary to human nature and the natural course of things. In her testimony, Theresa stated that the rapes occurred between 9:00 in the morning up to just before 12:00 noon, when no one else was left in the house except her and accused-appellant. It is allegedly incredible that she still allowed herself to be left alone with accused-appellant in the house knowing that he would sexually molest her. Accused-appellant likewise questions Theresa’s reasons for implicating him. Theresa explained during her testimony that she finally told Rodelia about what their father did to her ""when my older brother or 
kuya 
and I quarreled and I felt I had no ally in the family."" However, as stated in the decision of the trial court, Theresa disclosed that she sensed that accused-appellant ""planned on abusing her again when she finally revealed to her older sister 
(Ate) 
her ordeal in the hands of their father.""
19 


The appeal must fail.


In reviewing rape cases, this Court has always been guided by three well-entrenched principles: (a) that an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove, but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent to disprove; (b) that in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime which usually involves two persons, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) that the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of evidence of the defense.
20 
 Accordingly, the primordial consideration in a determination concerning the crime of rape is the credibility of the complainant’s testimony.
21 


It is well settled that the findings of the trial court on credibility of witnesses are entitled to great weight on appeal unless cogent reasons are presented necessitating a re-examination if not the disturbance of the same; the reason being the former is in a better and unique position of hearing first hand the witnesses and observing their deportment, conduct and attitude.
22 
 Absent any showing that the trial judge overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight which would affect the result of the case, the trial judge’s assessment of credibility deserves the appellate court’s highest respect.
23 


In this case, there is nothing on record that would impel this Court to deviate from the findings and conclusion of the trial court. Theresa testified in a categorical, straightforward and consistent manner, interrupted only by her tears as she recounted her harrowing experience at the hands of her father. She described how accused-appellant sexually assaulted her, not only once but five (5)
 
times in this manner:

25 


The foregoing testimony of Theresa is sufficient to establish the guilt of accused-appellant for the crimes charged.
26 
 
Indeed, it is highly inconceivable, if not completely preposterous, that Theresa, a guileless 
barrio 
lass, would concoct stories of rape against her very own father, taking into mind the societal humiliation and personal devastation which such charges entail.
27 
 
As this Court has consistently observed in countless incestuous rape cases:


A daughter would not concoct a story of defloration against her father, accuse him of so grave a crime as rape, allow an examination of her private parts, submit herself to public humiliation and scrutiny via an open public trial, if she were not truly aggrieved or her sordid tale was not true and her sole motivation was not to have the culprit apprehended and punished. In short, a teenage unmarried lass would not file a rape case against anybody, much less her own father, if it were not true.
28 


Significantly, the defense utterly failed to establish any motive on the part of Theresa to impute such grave crimes upon accused-appellant. In the face of this omission by the defense, her testimony should be accorded full credence.
29 
 
Her revelation could have been borne only by her desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed by accused-appellant against her.
30 
 Where there is no evidence to show any dubious reason or improper motive why a prosecution witness would testify falsely against an accused or falsely implicate him in a heinous crime, the testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.
31 


Contrary to accused-appellant’s contention, the Court does not find it incredible that Theresa allowed herself to be left alone in the house with accused-appellant. After all, he was her father. That she had to bear more sexual assaults before she mustered enough courage to confide in her sister could be explained by the fact that she was then only a child. She could not be expected to follow the ordinary course that other, more mature, women in the same situation would have taken. There is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted by a shocking incident. Verily, under emotional stress, the human mind is not expected to follow a predictable path.
32 


Further, Theresa’s testimony had been substantially corroborated by Dr. Aves’ findings that she was already in a ""non-virgin state."" Dr. Aves’ genital examination on Theresa showed that her hymen had multiple healed deep lacerations at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions.
33 
 
Laceration of the hymen, whether fresh or healed, is the best physical evidence of defloration.
34 
 Thus, Dr. Aves’ finding that Theresa had multiple lacerations on her hymen buttressed her testimony that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of her, his own flesh and blood.
1âwphi1


Accused-appellant’s inherently weak defense of denial and alibi cannot thus prevail over the positive, candid and categorical testimony of Theresa, whose credibility was upheld by the trial court.

By threatening to kill her and her mother, accused-appellant undoubtedly employed ""force and intimidation"" on Theresa in order for her to submit to his bestial desires. Theresa’s total obedience to accused-appellant and the stoic silence that she kept about her sufferings were all brought about by her genuine fear for the man who, on account of his moral ascendancy, needed no weapon to instill such terror in her.
36 


Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, when rape is committed on a woman who is under eighteen (18) years of age by a parent, the offender faces the imposition of the death penalty.


The prosecution adequately established that the victim, Theresa, was not over twelve (12) years old during the five (5) instances that she was raped by accused-appellant in the span of almost two (2) years from 1994 to 1996. Theresa, as well as Erlinda, her mother, testified as to her (Theresa’s) minority. Erlinda further averred that accused-appellant is her husband and the father of Theresa. The certificate of live birth
37 
 
presented likewise showed that Theresa was born on June 17, 1983 and that accused-appellant is her father. These qualifying circumstances, 
i.e., 
age and relationship, were properly alleged in the five (5)
 
informations filed against accused-appellant in Criminal Cases Nos. 1768-M-98 to 1772-M-98.


The concurrence of both the minority of the victim and her relationship to accused-appellant, having been alleged in the informations and duly proved with certainty and clearness as the crimes themselves constrains this Court to affirm accused-appellant’s conviction for five (5) counts of incestuous rape, justifying the imposition of the death penalty for each count on him.
38 


It is necessary, however, to modify the amount of damages awarded by the trial court. Under prevailing jurisprudence, if the commission of the crime of rape is effectively qualified by any of the circumstances under which the death penalty may be imposed, the civil indemnity for the victim shall be P75,000.00.
39 
 Additionally, moral damages are imposed in rape cases involving young girls, taking into account the immeasurable havoc wrought on their youthful feminine psyche. It is awarded without proof for it is assumed that the victim has suffered moral injuries entitling her such an award. The award of P50,000.00 as moral damages is accordingly in order.
40 


Three (3) members of the Court maintain the position that Republic Act No. 7659, insofar as it prescribes the death penalty is unconstitutional. Nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the Court, by a majority vote, that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty should be accordingly imposed.


WHEREFORE
, the Decision, dated May 18, 1999, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12 of Malolos, Bulacan in Criminal Cases Nos. 1768-M-98 to 1772-M-98 finding accused-appellant Romeo Reyes y Del Rosario guilty beyond reasonable doubt of five (5) counts of incestuous rape and imposing upon him the DEATH penalty for each count is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that accused-appellant is ordered to pay the victim, Theresa, the amounts of a total of P375,000.00 as civil indemnity and P250,000.00 as moral damages plus costs of suit.


SO ORDERED.
