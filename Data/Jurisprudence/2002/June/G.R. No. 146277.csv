Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the crime charged, whereupon the trial of the case followed.

Three (3) witnesses testified for the prosecution: PO2 Dorotheo Supa,
4
 Alma Margarita D. Villaseñor, and PO3 Juan Piggangay, Jr. Their testimonies established the following:


On August 16, 1999, a civilian informer, named Rose, walked into the office of Police Chief Inspector Benson Dagiw-a Leleng at the 14th Regional Narcotics Office, DPS Compound in Baguio City. She informed Chief Inspector Leleng and PO3 Juan Piggangay that a certain Albert Casimiro, accused-appellant herein, was engaged in the distribution or sale of marijuana. As proof, Rose told the police officers to wait and accused-appellant would call them up on that day. Accused-appellant, however, did not call up. Nonetheless, Police Chief Inspector Leleng formed a buy-bust team composed of P/Insp. Edgar Afalla as team leader, PO2 Dorotheo Supa as poseur-buyer, and SPO2 Marquez Madlon and PO3 Juan Piggangay, Jr. as back-up men.

The following day, August 17, 1999, Rose again told the Narcotics agents to wait for a call from accused-appellant. True enough, at around 4:00 p.m., the telephone rang. When PO2 Supa answered the telephone, he found that it was accused-appellant who was calling. Rose introduced on the telephone PO2 Supa to accused-appellant as someone who wanted to buy marijuana. Accused-appellant allegedly agreed to meet PO2 Supa at around 1:00 p.m. the following day outside Anthony’s Wine and Grocery at the YMCA Building, Post Office Loop, Upper Session Road. PO2 Supa said he wanted to buy one kilogram of marijuana and accused-appellant said it would cost 
P
1,500.00. Accused-appellant said he would wear white pants and a black leather jacket to their meeting the following day.
6


On August 18, 1999, at around 1:00 p.m., PO2 Supa and Rose went to the grocery store. SPO2 Madlon and PO3 Piggangay waited secretly inside the Post Office building, around 12 meters across the street, where they could see PO2 Supa and Rose. At around 1:30 p.m., accused-appellant arrived. Rose greeted him, ""
O Bert, heto na yung sinasabi ko sa iyong buyer. Bahala na kayong mag-usap. Aalis na ako
."" (Bert, here is the buyer I told you about. I’ll leave you two alone to talk.) Rose then left the two men alone.

PO2 Supa said he had 
P
1,500.00 with him and asked for the marijuana. Accused-appellant gave the poseur-buyer a paper bag, which contained an object wrapped in plastic and newspaper. After determining from its appearance and smell that the object inside was marijuana, PO2 Supa gave a signal for the back-up team to make an arrest by combing his hair. He testified that he no longer gave the marked money to accused-appellant because he placed the latter under arrest, reciting to him his rights, while the back-up team ran from across the street.
8


After arresting accused-appellant, the policemen took him to the 14th Narcom Office, where PO2 Supa, SPO2 Madlon, and PO3 Piggangay wrote their initials on the brick of marijuana before giving it to the evidence custodian. The policemen prepared a booking sheet and arrest report, affidavits, and a request for the laboratory examination of the confiscated marijuana.

 They also prepared a ""receipt of property seized,"" dated August 18, 1999, (Exh. L) which states:
