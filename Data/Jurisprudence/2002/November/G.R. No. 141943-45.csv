The indictees, when arraigned, pled ""not guilty"" to all the charges. The cases were tried jointly.


The Version of the Prosecution -


Marie Flamiano was a waitress at ""Sabungan Fastfood and Videoke Pub,"" located along Samson Road, in Caloocan City. At about one-thirty on the morning of 28 July 1999, she was attending to customers when seven men, she identified to be Diosdado Recepcion, Alfredo Baracas, Joemari delos Reyes, Bernardo Ranara, Dominador Recepcion, Robert Alfonso and Audie Dona, entered the pub while one was tailing behind at the entrance. The men occupied table 12 and ordered beer from waitress Eliza Bautista. A few minutes later, three men from the group transferred to table 10. Just as Marie was approaching table 13 to get the microphone from a customer, one of the men stood up and fired his gun at another customer. Marie identified this gunman to be Alfredo Baracas.


Eliza Bautista, the waitress who served the group, among them Diosdado Recepcion, Robert Alfonso, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Eduardo Palacpac, Joemari delos Reyes and Dominador Recepcion, saw another man pull out a gun and shot a customer, Rodolfo Ortega, while on his knees. The women later identified the gunman to be Diosdado Recepcion. Rosalia Juanica, a co-waitress who had meanwhile dashed out and hid at the nearby ""St. Joseph Store,"" saw Rodolfo Ortega, kneeling with both hands raised in plea, but one of the men, she likewise identified to be Diosdado Recepcion, fired his gun at pointblank range.


Jojo Paraiso was with his co-security guards having a drinking spree when a group of armed men, started shooting. Some of the men shouted, ""dapa,"" but Jojo’s companion, Benjamin Valdez, unfortunately took a bullet shot before he could get the chance to heed the warning. Jojo identified the person who fired at Valdez to be Robert Alfonso. He hid under the table and could only watch the men gone berserk. The last of the gunmen who left the pub, still firing his gun, was Joemari delos Reyes.


Jhosa Reyes, a waitress at the A & E Kitchenette just across the Sabungan, saw the gunmen and their cohorts scamper away after the shooting incident. She recognized three of the gunmen, Robert Alfonso, Joemari delos Reyes and Eduardo Palacpac, as being ""regular"" customers at the A & E Kitchenette. Shortly before the shooting, Alfonso, delos Reyes, Palacpac and another companion were drinking at the kitchenette but soon headed towards the alley near the pub.


Found sprawled on the floor, when the shooting finally stopped, were the lifeless bodies of five men - Benjamin Valdez, Augusto Billodo, Renato Cleofas, Rodolfo Ortega and Ruperto San Juan.


Ruben Labjata, a jeepney driver, was waiting for passengers at Dagohoy Street, Caloocan City, when he heard gunshots. He was about to leave with only a few passengers when, unexpectedly, three men arrived and ordered all the passengers to get off the vehicle. The men menacingly pointed their guns at Labjata and ordered him to drive. Moments later, five more men boarded his jeepney. Three of the men stayed with the driver at the front seat while the other five sat at the rear. The group directed Labjata to drive towards Monumento and then to EDSA. After stopping briefly at Petron Station to refuel, the group proceeded to Quezon City. At a ""7-11"" convenience store in Tandang Sora, some of the men alighted from the vehicle. More gunshots were fired. Boarding once again the jeepney, the men told Labjata to go north until they finally reached, hours later, Paniqui, Tarlac. At Paniqui, the men debated on the driver’s fate. After hearing one suggest that he should be killed (""tumba""), Labjata panicked and begged the group to spare him -""maawa po kayo, may pamilya po ako."" One of the men allowed him to go home with a warning that he should not report the incident to the police. In open court, he identified the malefactors to be Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Diosdado Recepcion, Bernardo Ranara, Eduardo Palacpac, Dominador Recepcion, Joemari delos Reyes and Robert Alfonso.


Conrado Marquez, a tricycle driver, was waiting for passengers along the highway of Paniqui, Tarlac, when he saw a group of men alight from a dirty jeepney. Four of the men rode in his tricycle, while the other four took two more tricycles. Marquez brought the group to Brgy. Coral, Ramos, Tarlac.


Around lunchtime on 29 July 1999, the Bulacan Police invited Ruben Labjata for questioning. Taken by police authorities to Tarlac, he pointed to the exact place where the armed men got off from his vehicle. Conrado Marquez, likewise invited by the police for interrogation, readily informed the police of the place where he brought the men who hired his tricycle. The police promptly cordoned the area and the group, along with FO1 Felipe dela Cruz, surrendered after several calls by the police. Taken into custody were Felipe dela Cruz, Joemari delos Reyes, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Eduardo Palacpac, Bernardo Ranara, Robert Alfonso, and Dominador Recepcion. Diosdado Recepcion, then a special agent of the Narcotics Command, was intercepted at the national highway of Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija, on board a tricycle. At the Tarlac Police Station, Labjata identified his passengers, namely, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Diosdado Recepcion, Bernardo Ranara, Eduardo Palacpac, Dominador Recepcion, Joemari delos Reyes and Robert Alfonso.


Diosdado Recepcion, Felipe dela Cruz, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Eduardo Palacpac, Bernardo Ranara, Joemari delos Reyes, Dominador Recepcion, and Roberto Alfonso were charged with multiple murder, violation of P.D. No. 1866, and robbery in band before the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Region, Branch 129, Caloocan City. The incident that occurred at the 7-11 convenience store also spawned several separate criminal informations (not involved in the instant cases under review).


During the trial, Diosdado Recepcion died in an escape attempt, while accused Bernardo Ranara escaped and remained at large.


The Version of the Defense


The defense interposed alibi.


According to Dominador Recepcion, he was, at the time of the reported shooting incident, fast asleep at Greenwoods Subdivision in Cainta, Rizal, where he was a construction worker. His co-workers were Eduardo Palacpac and Robert Alfonso. On the evening of 27 July 1999, the trio went to Pansi, Paniqui, Tarlac, to help Dominador Recepcion’s nephew, Joemari delos Reyes, find a job. It was after one o’clock in the afternoon when Joemari brought them to the house of his cousin FO1 Felipe dela Cruz.


Joemari delos Reyes testified that, on the afternoon of 28 July 1999, he was at home when his uncle Dominador Recepcion arrived with Robert Alfonso and Eduardo Palacpac. He brought his guests to the house of Felipe dela Cruz where they partook of beer.


Felipe dela Cruz stated that on 28 July 1999, about one o’clock in the afternoon, his father fetched him from a cousin’s house. When he arrived home, he was met by Joemari delos Reyes along with the latter’s companions, namely, Eduardo Palacpac, Robert Alfonso, and Dominador Recepcion. In the evening of the same day, about eight o’clock, he invited his visitors to join him in attending a wake just a few meters away, and they stayed there until dawn. The following morning of 29 July 1999, policemen arrived and cordoned his house. He was arrested together with Joemari delos Reyes, Audie Dona and Alfredo Baracas. During a series of questioning at the Caloocan Police Station, dela Cruz insisted that he was attending a wake at the time the shooting incident occurred in Caloocan City.


Audie Dona said that on 28 July 1999, he and his friend Alfredo Baracas, went to Pansi, Ramos, Tarlac, to visit his cousin Joemari delos Reyes and to get some fresh fish and vegetables. When he did not find Joemari at his house, he and Baracas proceeded to the place of dela Cruz where they were invited to join the group of Felipe dela Cruz, Joemari delos Reyes, Eduardo Palacpac, and Dominador Recepcion in a drinking spree. Dona and Baracas stayed until nine o’clock in the evening when they repaired to the house of Joemari to spend the night. On 29 July 1999, he and Baracas went back to see dela Cruz but found Joemari still sleeping. The two dozed off while waiting for Joemari to wake up until they all found themselves surrounded by the police.


When the trial was over and weighing the evidence before it, the court a quo found the several accused guilty in Criminal Case No. C-57208 for multiple murder but acquitted them in Criminal Case No. C-57209 for the charge of illegal possession of firearm and Criminal Case No. 57210 for robbery in band because of insufficiency of evidence.

The capital punishment having been imposed on herein appellants for the crime of multiple murder, the case was elevated to this Court for automatic review. In their brief, appellants ascribed to the trial court a number of alleged errors but, by and large, they focused on the issue of credibility of the witnesses and the imposition of the death penalty.


Appellants argue that the witnesses presented by the prosecution have committed several inconsistencies, mainly on the identities of the gunmen, said to be well enough to discredit their testimony. The poor lighting condition of the pub, they claim, could have easily blurred the vision of the witnesses frustrating any clear identification of the assailants. The defense also belabors the finding of conspiracy and, in general, of their conviction by the trial court.


In criminal cases, particularly where the capital punishment is imposed, this Court takes a most painstaking effort to ascertain the guilt or innocence of the convicted accused. Nevertheless, it has long been a standing rule that the findings on the credibility of witnesses by the trial court are hardly disturbed on appeal. The appellate court adheres to such deference in view of the vantage that a trial court enjoys in its reception of testimonial evidence, It is only when there evidently are matters of substance that have been overlooked that an appellate court would feel justified to ignore the evaluation and assessment made by the trial court on such evidence. Looking closely at the records, nothing significant is disclosed to warrant a reversal of the rule. Observe thusly -

""Q You mean to tell me that aside from Diosdado Recepcion, all the 7 accused were all standing?

On cross-examination, Paraiso continued:


""Q Mr. Witness, you said that the shooting incident happened at 1:30 in the early morning of July 28, 1999. What time did you start drinking at the Sabungan Restaurant?


""A About 12:45 a.m., sir.


""Q How many bottles of what were you drinking?

""A Yes, sir. I know that they did not notice me there under the table, sir. Maybe if they noticed me that I was there under the table looking at them, maybe they would shoot me, sir.


""Q So, we can presume that you were not shot because you were not seen by the gunman?


""A Yes, sir.


""Q You were not seen because the table was about 3 x 3 ft. Do you mean to tell us Mr. Witness that 3 ft. x 3 ft. table was able to accommodate all 5 of you?


""A Yes, sir.


""Q Now, you were also not seen by the gunman because the table was covered by the table cloth?


""A No cover, sir.


""Q You felt that at that time that you present yourself under the table was not detected by the gunman because none of them noticed you under the table?


""A I know that I was [not] noticed by them, sir. Because they have noticed me under the table and they know that I was looking at them, they will shoot me, sir.""

The eyewitnesses categorically identified the malefactors. The alleged discrepancies in the testimony of the witnesses could easily be explained by the fact that they saw the incident from different angles of the shooting. The impact of events, as well as the unconscious working of the mind, it is said, could readily warp the human perception in varying ways and degrees. Empiric data is yet to be found in order to accurately measure the value of testimony of a witness other than its conformity to human behavior and the common experience of mankind.
14




The defense of alibi proffered by appellants is much too weak against the positive identification made by the eyewitnesses. It is not enough for an alibi to prosper to prove that the person raising it has been somewhere else when the crime is committed; it must likewise be demonstrated that it would have been physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.
15
 Where there is the least chance to be present at the locus criminis, alibi will not hold much water.
16
 The bare evidence given by appellants to vouch their individual claims and establish alibi is far from being iron-clad against the possibility of their having been at the crime scene.


Article 248
17
 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659, makes a person guilty of murder if the killing is attended by, among other circumstances (but not here appurtenant), treachery or evident premeditation. An essence of treachery is not only the swiftness and the surprise in the attack upon an unsuspecting victim but also the attendance of two concurring conditions, i.e., that the malefactor must have employed means, method or manner of execution that would insure his safety from the retaliatory act of the victim, and such means, method or form of execution are consciously and deliberately adopted by the malefactor. The qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation, on the other hand, requires that the execution of the criminal act be preceded by cool thought and reflection upon a resolution to carry out the criminal intent during the space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.
18
 Evident premeditation needs proof of the time when the intent to commit the crime is engendered in the mind of the accused, the motive which gives rise to it, and the means which are beforehand selected to carry out that intent. All such facts and antecedents which make notorious the pre-existing design to accomplish the criminal purpose must be proven to the satisfaction of the court.
19


A scrutiny of the facts in evidence would indicate a scanty showing of the requirements to qualify the senseless killing of the five victims, either by treachery or by evident premeditation, to murder. While the attack upon the victims could be described as being unexpected, somehow voiding any risk to the perpetrators thereof, there, is, however, insufficient evidence to indicate that the means adopted by the appellants have consciously been adopted. Mere suddenness of the attack is not enough to show treachery; it should also be shown that the mode of attack has knowingly been intended to accomplish the wicked intent.
20
 Neither would evident premeditation qualify the offense to murder in the absence of clear substantiation that the appellants have definitely resolved to commit the offense and have reflected on the means to bring about the execution following an appreciable length of time.


The trial court, however, correctly appreciated conspiracy. The presence of conspiracy could be revealed by the acts done before, during and after the commission of the crime that made evident a joint purpose, concerted action and concurrence of sentiments.
21
 The several acts of appellants during and after the shooting rampage disclosed a unison of objectives. Not one tried to stop the other in the perpetration of the crime. All were clearly in it together, performing specific acts with such closeness and coordination as would unmistakably show a common scheme. The attendance of treachery would thus render it unnecessary for the prosecution to show who among the conspirators actually hit and killed their victims, each of them being equally liable with the other in the perpetration of the crime.


Without proof of any circumstance that would qualify it, the killing could not amount to murder. Appellants should thus be held liable only for homicide for the death of each of the victims. It was alleged in the accusatory information and shown in evidence that the crimes were indeed perpetrated with the use of unlicensed firearms. Pursuant to Republic Act 8294
22
 (amending Presidential Decree No. 1866), which was already in effect when the killing spree occurred, if ""homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance.""


The trial court has convicted FOl Felipe dela Cruz as an accessory. This Court, however, finds no evidence to convict him as such accessory. Under Article 19 of the Revised Penal Code, the actual knowledge of the commission of the crime is an important element to being an encubridor, and the records are bereft of sound proof that dela Cruz has had knowledge of any or all of the nefarious deeds earlier committed by his guests.


The arrest of appellants has been made in ""hot pursuit,"" an exception from the rule that warrantless arrests are illegal. In any event, appellants can no longer assail the illegality of their arrest since such a claim has not been brought up before or during the arraignment. The failure to timely move for the quashal of the Information on this basis operates as a waiver of the right to question the supposed irregularity of the arrest.
23


The crime of homicide is punishable under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code by reclusion temporal with a duration of 12 years and 1 day to 20 years. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the appellants may be held to suffer imprisonment, as minimum, of anywhere within the full range of prision mayor of from 6 years and 1 day to 12 years and, as maximum, to anywhere within the range of reclusion temporal in its maximum period, considering the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of ""use of an unlicensed firearm,"" of from 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 20 years.


The damages awarded by the trial court accord with prevailing jurisprudence except for the grant of P100,000.00 moral damages to the heirs of each of the victims which amount should be reduced to P50,000.00.


WHEREFORE, the assailed judgment of the court a quo convicting appellants is AFFIRMED subject to the following MODIFICATIONS, to wit:


Appellants Dominador Recepcion, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Eduardo Palacpac, Bernardo Ranara, Joemari delos Reyes and Robert Alfonso are all hereby found guilty of homicide, on five counts, and each of them shall suffer five imprisonment terms, each for the death of their five victims, of the indeterminate penalty of 9 years and 1 day of prision mayor, as minimum, to 16 years and 1 day of reclusion temporal in its maximum period, as maximum, and shall pay, jointly and severally, the sums adjudged by the trial court except that the P100,000.00 moral damages to each victim is reduced, correspondingly, to P50,000.00.


Appellant Felipe dela Cruz is ACQUITTED for insufficiency of evidence.
