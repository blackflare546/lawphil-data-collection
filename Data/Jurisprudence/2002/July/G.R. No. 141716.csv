In accordance with the sailing orders, Captain Inguito obtained the necessary sailing clearance from the Philippine Coast Guard.
3
 Loading of the cargo on the M/V Doña Roberta was completed at 8:30 p.m. of November 11, 1990. However, the vessel did not leave Mandaue City until 6:00 a.m. of the following day, November 12, 1990.


Meanwhile, at 4:00 a.m. of November 12, 1990, typhoon Ruping was spotted 570 kilometers east-southeast of Borongan, Samar, moving west-northwest at 22 kilometers per hour in the general direction of Eastern Visayas. The typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 240 kilometers per hour near the center with gustiness of up to 280 kilometers per hour.
4


At 7:00 a.m., November 12, 1990, one hour after the M/V Doña Roberta departed from Mandaue City and while it was abeam Cawit Island off Cebu, SMC Radio Operator Rogelio P. Moreno contacted Captain Inguito through the radio and advised him to take shelter. Captain Inguito replied that they will proceed since the typhoon was far away from them, and that the winds were in their favor.
5


At 2:00 p.m., while the vessel was two kilometers abeam Boljoon Point, Moreno again communicated with Captain Inguito and advised him to take shelter. The captain responded that they can manage.
6
 Hearing this, Moreno immediately tried to get in touch with Rico Ouano to tell him that Captain Inguito did not heed their advice. However, Rico Ouano was out of his office, so Moreno left the message with the secretary.
7


Moreno again contacted Captain Inguito at 4:00 p.m. of November 12, 1990. By then the vessel was already 9.5 miles southeast of Balicasag Island heading towards Sulauan Point. The sky was cloudy with southwesterly winds and the sea was choppy.
8
 Moreno reiterated the advice and pointed out that it will be difficult to take shelter after passing Balicasag Island because they were approaching an open sea. Still, the captain refused to heed his advice.
9


At 8:00 p.m., the vessel was 38 miles southeast of Balicasag Island. West-southwest winds were prevailing. At 10:00 p.m., the M/V Doña Roberta was 25 miles approaching Sulauan Point.
10
 Moments later, power went out in Moreno’s office and resumed at 11:40 p.m. He immediately made a series of calls to the M/V Doña Roberta but he failed to get in touch with anyone in the vessel.
11


At 1:15 a.m., November 13, 1990, Captain Inguito called Moreno over the radio and requested him to contact Rico Ouano, son of Julius Ouano, because they needed a helicopter to rescue them. The vessel was about 20 miles west of Sulauan Point.
12


Upon being told by SMC’s radio operator, Rico Ouano turned on his radio and read the distress signal from Captain Ingiuto. When he talked to the captain, the latter requested for a helicopter to rescue them.
13
 Rico Ouano talked to the Chief Engineer who informed him that they can no longer stop the water from coming into the vessel because the crew members were feeling dizzy from the petroleum fumes.
14


At 2:30 a.m. of November 13, 1990, the M/V Doña Roberta sank. Out of the 25 officers and crew on board the vessel, only five survived, namely, Fernando Bucod, Rafael Macairan, Chenito Sugabo, Ramil Pabayo and Gilbert Gonzaga.
15


On November 24, 1990, shipowner Julius Ouano, in lieu of the captain who perished in the sea tragedy, filed a Marine Protest.
16


The heirs of the deceased captain and crew, as well as the survivors,
17
 of the ill-fated M/V Doña Roberta filed a complaint for tort against San Miguel Corporation and Julius Ouano, docketed as Civil Case No. 2472-L of the Regional Trial Court of Lapu-Lapu City, Branch 27.
18


Julius Ouano filed an answer with cross-claim,
19
 alleging that the proximate cause of the loss of the vessel and its officers and crew was the fault and negligence of SMC, which had complete control and disposal of the vessel as charterer and which issued the sailing order for its departure despite being forewarned of the impending typhoon. Thus, he prayed that SMC indemnify him for the cost of the vessel and the unrealized rentals and earnings thereof.


In its answer to the complaint
19
 and answer to the cross-claim,
20
 SMC countered that it was Ouano who had the control, supervision and responsibilities over the navigation of the vessel. This notwithstanding, and despite his knowledge of the incoming typhoon, Ouano never bothered to initiate contact with his vessel. Contrary to his allegation, SMC argued that the proximate cause of the sinking was Ouano’s breach of his obligation to provide SMC with a seaworthy vessel duly manned by competent crew members. SMC interposed counterclaims against Ouano for the value of the cargo lost in the sea tragedy.


After trial, the court 
a quo 
rendered judgment finding that the proximate cause of the loss of the M/V Doña Roberta was attributable to SMC. Thus, it disposed of the case as follows:




WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered:


1. Declaring defendant San Miguel Corporation and its acts or omissions as having produced the proximate cause which resulted in the death of the crew members of MN Doña Roberta at past midnight of November 12, 1990 during the height of super typhoon ""Ruping"" and as such said defendant is hereby ordered and sentenced to pay to the heirs of the deceased crew members the following sum[s] plus 12% per annum from the filing of the Complaint:

B. For loss of earnings based on life expectancy less 
50% 
representing estimated living expenses except for the apprentices as they were presumed at the time of their deaths to be dependent on their parents:
