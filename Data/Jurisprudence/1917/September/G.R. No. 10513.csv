JOHNSON, 
J.:


The purpose of the present action was to recover damages for the loss of the sailing vessel 
Carmencita
, the property of the plaintiffs, and her cargo which was lost at high sea in a collision with the steamship 
Taculin
 which belonged to the defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that the said 
Carmencita
 was lost at sea through the negligence of the agents and representatives of the defendants in managing and operating the said steamship 
Taculin
. It is alleged that on or about midnight of the 27th day of April, 1914, the said 
Carmencita
 was sailing south from the city of Cebu and, at the time of the collision, was just east of the Island of Guimaras between the point Culasi of the Island of Guimaras and Pulupandan, a part of the municipality of Valladolid of the province of Occidental Negros; that the steamship 
Taculin
 was sailing north and had come from the said port of Pulupandan; and that at that point a collision took place between the said two ships, caused by the negligence of the captain and crew of the said 
Taculin
; and that as a result of said collision the sailing vessel 
Carmencita
 was totally destroyed together with her cargo as well as the life of one of the passengers, the daughter of the captain; that the value of the cargo was P225; and that the value of the said sailing vessel was P5,500. 


The defendants filed a general denial. Upon the issue presented by the petition and the answer the case was brought on for trial. After hearing the evidence, the Honorable J. S. Powell, judge, found that a preponderance of the evidence showed that the defendants, through their agents and representatives, in managing the steamship 
Taculin
 negligently destroyed the sailing vessel 
Carmencita
 together with her cargo, and rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants for the sum of P5,225 with interest from the 22d day of October, 1914, until paid, and the costs. From that judgment the defendants appealed to this court. 


In their first assignment of error the appellants alleged that the lower court committed an error in finding that the said sailing ship 
Carmencita
 carried lights at the time of the collision. Upon that question the captain of the 
Carmencita
 and several members of her crew swore positively that the said ship was lighted in accordance with the requirements of navigation. She had a green light upon the starboard and a red light upon the larboard side of the boat as well as the lights. The statements of the captain and his crew were also supported by the captain of another boat, the Estrella, who passed the 
Carmencita
 a short time before the collision took place. That captain swore that the 
Carmencita
 had the usual lights; that he passed near by the said 
Carmencita
 on the night in question. The captain of the 
Taculin
 swore that he did not see any lights upon the 
Carmencita
 at the time of or immediately before the collision took place. Upon the first assignment of error there seems to be a large preponderance of evidence in favor of the finding of the lower court. 


The appellants in their second assignment of error alleged that the court erred in finding that the captain of the 
Taculin
 was guilty of negligence. The captain of the 
Taculin
 swore that he did not see the 
Carmencita
 until he was right upon her; that he was within twenty brazas before he saw her. The captain of the 
Carmencita
 swore that he saw the 
Taculin
 approaching; that he first saw the red light of the 
Taculin
; that almost immediately he saw the green light of the 
Taculin
; and that then the collision occurred. If it be true that the captain of the 
Carmencita
 first saw the red light of the 
Taculin
 and then very shortly saw the green light that fact is proof positive that the 
Taculin
 has changed her course; for if she had continued in the direction in which she was going at the time the captain of the 
Carmencita
 saw the red light, she would have passed upon the port side of the 
Carmencita
. To have changed her course, which the captain of the 
Taculin
 admitted so as to display the green light upon the starboard side is proof positive that such a change in course brought the 
Taculin
 in a direction which would cross the path of the 
Carmencita
. The proof shows that the 
Taculin
 collided with the 
Carmencita
 upon the port side which was the natural result for the change of course above indicated, by the 
Taculin
 which enabled the captain of the 
Carmencita
 to see the green light of the 
Taculin
 after he had first seen the red light. It will be remembered that the red light are always put upon the starboard side of the ship at sea. As further proof of the negligence of the captain of the 
Taculin
 we have the declaration of captain Echevaria. He testified that had the 
Taculin
 been properly managed, the collision might have been avoided after the time when the captain of the 
Taculin
 first saw the 
Carmencita
 at a distance of twenty 
brazas 
or about 120 feet. Captain Echevaria testified that even in a shorter distance that 120 feet the collision might have been avoided. 


In considering the question of negligence we must not overlook the fact that the 
Carmencita
 was a sailing vessel while the 
Taculin
 was a ship operated by steam, nor the International Rules (article 20) for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea that; ""If two ships, one of which is a sailing ship and the other a steamship, are proceedings in such directions as to involve risk of collision, the steamship shall keep out of the way of the sailing ship."" 


Article 21 of the International Rules for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea provides that; ""Where by any of these rules one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed."" 


The proof shows that the captain of the 
Taculin
 changed the course of his ship in a way that brought it cross the path of the 
Carmencita
. We are of the opinion that a large preponderance of the proof support the conclusion of the lower court that the captain of the 
Taculin
 was negligent in the management of his ship, which directly caused the loss of the said 
Carmencita
. 


In their third assignment of error the appellants alleged that the lower court committed an error in rendering a judgment against them for the sum of P5,225. It is admitted that the cargo was valued at P225. Several witnesses testified that the 
Carmencita
 was worth more than P5,000. Some of the witnesses testified that she was worth, at least P5,500. There is sufficient proof in the record to justify the conclusion of the lower court that the 
Carmencita
 was worth, at least P5,000. Valuing the ship at P5,000 and the cargo at P225 a judgment was rendered for the sum of P5,225. We think that part of the judgment of the lower court is fully sustained by a preponderance of the proof. 


After a careful examination of the evidence we find no reasons for altering or modifying the judgment of the lower court. The same is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs. So ordered.
