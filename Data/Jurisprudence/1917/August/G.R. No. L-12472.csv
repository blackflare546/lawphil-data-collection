DY SUN TIT,
 plaintiff-appellant,

vs.


THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS,
 defendant-appellee. 


Williams, Ferrier and SyCip for appellant. 

Acting Attorney-General Paredes for appellee. 


JOHNSON, 
J.
:


The only question presented by this appeal is whether or not a minor son, who had never been in the Philippine Islands, may enter, after the death of his father who had been a resident Chinese merchant. That question has been answered in the negative so many times that we deem it unnecessary to discuss the question again except to recite the former decisions. (Lee Jua

The judgment of the lower court denying the appellant the right to enter the Philippine Islands is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs. So ordered.
