G.R. No. L-12625            August 11, 1917


THE UNITED STATES,
 plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


LEONCIO SANCHEZ or YORDAN,
 defendant-appellant. 


Ramon F. Alberto for appellant. 

Acting Attorney-General Paredes for appellee. 


JOHNSON, 
J.
:


Paragraph 3 of article 14 [6] of Act No. 2587 provides for the licensing of chauffeurs. Paragraph 8 of said article provides for the punishment of any person who attempts to operate a motor vehicle without having procured a license. The punishment for violation of said law is a fine of not less than P25 nor more than P200 for each offense, provided that if the vehicle so operated is for let or hire the penalty shall be a fine of not less than P25 nor more than P200, or imprisonment of not less than ten days nor more than thirty days, or both, in the discretion of the court for each offense. 


That the defendant and appellant was operating an automobile at the time and place mentioned in the complaint is admitted by him. That he had no license to operate motor vehicles is proved beyond question. 


Therefore, the sentence of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs. So ordered. 


Arellano, C.J., Carson, Araullo, Street and Malcolm, JJ.,
 concur.
