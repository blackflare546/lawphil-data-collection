TRENT, 
J.
:


Crispulo Martinez, the deceased husband of Dolores Arce Ignacio and father of the minor Arsenio Martinez, was a brother of Felisa Martinez and uncle of Juan Martinez, the defendants. The plaintiff's ward and the defendants were the owners in equal parts of the undivided real estate described in the complaint. Dolores Arce Ignacio, as the guardian of her minor son, instituted this action for the purpose of having the property divided real estate described in the complaint. Dolores Arce Ignacio, as the guardian of her minor son, instituted this action for the purpose of having the property divided and the one-third part belonging to the minor turned over to her. Judgment was also asked against the defendant, Felisa Martinez, for one-third of the value of the products of the land during the time the latter had been in the exclusive possession of the same. The defendant, Felisa Martinez, alleged that she and her deceased husband bought Crispulo Martinez' interest in the property in question in 1908. Judgment was entered by the court below in accordance with the prayer of the complaint, and the defendant, Felisa Martinez, appealed.


That an adult heir may sell, assign or mortgage his undivided interest in the estate of his deceased parents, although he himself has legal heirs, there can be no question. (Ramirez 
vs
. Bautista, 14 Phil. Rep., 528.) So, therefore, our inquiry is limited to the question relating to the validity of appellants' Exhibit No. 2 and the legal effect resulting therefrom. This exhibit reads as follows:

(2)	That the total value of the said property constituting our inheritance, or the assessed value of the same amounts to (P2,700) two thousand, seven hundred pesos, Philippine currency, which, divided into three equal parts, makes the share of each one (900) nine hundred pesos.


(3)	That, by my being in Manila pursuing a course of studying in secondary instruction and law during the five years immediately preceding the execution of this document, I have spent the sum of (P2,500) two thousand, five hundred pesos, which was paid by the married couple Luciano Lopez and Felisa Martinez, the said sum having been spent by me in the following manner:
