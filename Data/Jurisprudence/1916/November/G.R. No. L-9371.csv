THE FRANCISCAN CORPORATION OF THE PROVINCE OF SAN GREGORIO MAGNO,
 applicant-appellant,

vs.


THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF MANILA,
 objector-appellee.


Perfecto Gabriel for appellant.

William A. Kincaid and Thomas L. Hartigan for appellee.




ARAULLO, 
J.:


The purpose of these proceedings is to secure the inscription  in the property registry, in behalf of the applicant  corporation of a real property which, as stated in the application,  was acquired by occupation by the said corporation  for more than 334 years and is described as follows:




A parcel of land situated in the district of Santa Ana,  Manila, P. I., bounded on the north by the property of  Doña Julia Tuason; on the east, by the properties of Mauricio  Felix and Demetrio Rosales; on the south, by Calle  Lamayan; and on the west, by lot No. 2, the Santa Ana  Church. Containing 3,862 square meters.




This application was opposed by the Roman Catholic  Archbishop of Manila, a unipersonal corporation which  claimed to be the exclusive owner of the said land.


The objector moved to dismiss the application on the  ground that it was filed by the said Franciscan Corporation  without due authorization from the Holy See, which motion  was overruled, the trial court being of the opinion that the  applicant had the requisite legal capacity for the exercise  of its civil rights, and the objector excepted to the ruling.  The case was heard, evidence was submitted by both parties  and on April 10, 1913, judgment was rendered sustaining  the said opposition and finally dismissing the application,  without special finding as to costs. To this judgment the  applicant excepted and at the same time asked for a new  trial, which was denied. Exception to this ruling was likewise  taken by the applicant, which appealed to this Supreme  Court through the proper bill of exceptions and  assignment of errors.


The application for registration relates only to the land  therein described, which is a part of the land designated  in the plan Exhibit A, presented with the said application  and also in the plan Exhibit D-1 which was also presented  in evidence during the trial.


The record shows that the whole of the land shown on  the said plans covered by two buildings, to wit: the  Roman Catholic church of the district of Santa Ana of this  city, and, toward the east of this church and adjoining it,  the Convent of Santa Ana; this latter is also composed  of two parts, one of which is the parochial building, used  as a dwelling for the parish priests and is contiguous to  the church, and the other the building used as an abode for  the aged priests and those on vacation belonging to the  Franciscan Order, the applicant corporation. The application  is confined solely to the parcel of land on which this  last mentioned part of the building is constructed, known  as a whole, as the Convent of Santa Ana, and this parcel  is the one described in the application.


With regard to the land, the trial court says in the  judgment appealed from that neither the applicant nor the  objector has presented any direct proof of the manner in  which it was acquired; but that the applicant cited certain  chronicles of its order, written in the year 1738, which mention  the evangelical labors carried on by the said order in  several of the pueblos of the Philippine islands, and in  which the following appears:




Where the labor of our first founders secured the most  conspicuous results was in the following districts: Along  the Manila River, where churches and towns were erected  in Dilao, Quiapo, Santa Ana de Sapa, Antipolo. . . .




The trial court adds, however, that this chronicle proves  nothing, and the erection of churches by the Franciscan  friars does not mean that the land on which they stand  really belongs to the Franciscan Corporation, but that, were  the contrary the case, the legal presumption would be in  its favor, that is to say, if the land belonged to it, we  should be led to conclude from this fact that the churches  built thereon were also its property.


Of course we agree that the legal presumption is that  the owner of the land is also the owner of the building  erected thereon, but it is also true sometimes one person  is the owner of the land while another owns the building,  and that where a building is found on a piece of land, as is  the Convent of Santa Ana on a tract that comprises all the  area adjacent to the church of the said pueblo, as seen by  the plans Exhibits A and D-1, has stood on it for more than  a hundred years, and the owner of the land is unknown and  no one has claimed to be its owner, the legal presumption is  that the owner of the building is the owner of the land, and  the mere fact of the possession of the land by means of the  building that has stood on it for so many years is sufficient  to convert the owner or the possessor of the building into  an owner of the land by prescription. This is the feature  that must be considered in this case, for the applicant does  not seek to register the building, but the land on which it  stands, or rather that part of the land covered by a part  of the building (marked on the plan Exhibit A as Lot  E-1) which is described in the application and was designated  in the proceedings as the building used as an abode  for the aged priests and priests on vacation belonging to  the Franciscan Corporation, thus distinguishing it from  the other part of the building, that is, the parochial building  used as a dwelling for the parish priests and which is  contiguous with the church.


There is no evidence whatever in the record to show  that the parochial church of the pueblo of Santa Ana and  the convent annexed thereto were constructed at the expense  of the municipality of this pueblo, or with funds of  the objector corporation, that is, of the Archbishop of  Manila, or out of those of the Roman Catholic Church of  the Philippines. On the other hand, it is shown by the  chronicles mentioned by the lower court in the judgment  appealed from, 
Cronicas de la Apostolica Provinciua de Religiosos  Descalzos de San Francisco, en las Islas Filipinas,  China y Japon
, written by Friar Juan Francisco de San  Antonio and printed in the year 1738 (a certified copy of  the part thereof pertinent to the case at bar was presented  at the trial and admitted in evidence), that the Franciscan  friars founded, among other churches and towns along  the Manila River, those of Santa Ana de Sapa, that is, of  the church here in question, and it is impossible to refuse  credence to those chronicles written and printed more than  178 years ago. It was also disclosed by evidence that was  not challenged by the objector, that the priests of the San  Franciscan Corporation have managed the affairs of the  Santa Ana parish and since time immemorial, or rather  since its foundation, have been in possession of the building  called the Convent of Santa Ana, with the exception  of at most three years during the Revolution against Spain,  that is, until the year 1898. During the period the spiritual  administration of the pueblo was commended to Filipino  priests of the secular clergy for the reason that the  Franciscan friars were obliged to take refuge in the main  convent of their order; but at the expiration thereof they  again took possession of the said convent and again undertook  the management of the affairs of the parish and were  continuing in this possession at the time the applicant commenced  these proceedings.


The trial court says it is an admitted fact that the church  and a part of the building called the convent are the church  and parochial building of the Catholic community of the  district of Santa Ana, and that, as such, it is unquestionable  that they belong to the objector; that, furthermore,  it appears from the record that the land on which that  church and that part of the so-called parochial building  stand likewise belong to the objector.


As already stated, no question has been raised in these  proceedings with respect to the ownership of the church  and the part of the building called the convent and used  as the parochial building of the pueblo of Santa Ana; but  it is not true that the record shows that the land on which  that church and the said part of the so-called parish building  stand, belongs to the objector. At least, in so far as  concerns the land occupied by the whole building called  the convent and composed of the two parts aforementioned,  the ownership should be deemed to pertain to the persons  who were in possession of the said building since it was  erected, to wit, the Franciscan Corporation, the applicant,  and it is this point that should have been considered by the  trial court in deciding the application of the said corporation  for the registration of one of the two parts of the said  building.


The record discloses that prior to the year 1881 difference  and disagreements arose between the Archbishop of  Manila and the Franciscan Corporation with respect to the  ownership of the building called the convent of the pueblo  of Santa Ana, and, consequently, with respect to that part of  the land occupied by this building also, for this land, as  aforesaid, should have been and should be deemed to belong  to the owner or possessor of the building standing  thereon.


First of all, there is the decree of the governing chapter  of the Franciscan Order, dated December 6, 1871 (Exhibit  B). In this document the words our convent of the pueblo  of Santa Ana de Sapa"" are employed in authorizing the  father provincial of the order to incur such expenses as  he might deem necessary to put the building in good condition  and to insure its prevention, and to provide the  necessary shelter, protection and comfort of the aged friars  and priests on vacation.


In another decree by the same governing chapter, inserted  in the minutes of the provincial chapter held by the  Franciscan Order on May 31, 1873 (Exhibit E-2), the following  appears:




8th 
Prelacy 
— Minutes of the Provincial Chapter held on May 31, 1873.


1. The Venerable Governing Chapter, at the suggestion  of the Venerable 
Discreto
, hereby approves the minutes of  the last chapter, thus giving force of law to the new constitutions  referred to therein.


DECREES OF THE VENERABLE GOVERNING CHAPTER.


1. The Venerable Governing Chapter advises and charges our beloved provincial brother to conduct as soon as possible and in writing such negotiations as he may deem necessary, with His Excellency the Archbishop, until a final agreement is reached in regard to the part of the Convent of Santa Ana de Sapa to be alloted as a dwelling for the parish priest and the part thereof to be used by the friars on vacation and a sa dwelling for aged friars. After the division [between these two parts] has been clearly marked on the plan, it shall be incumbent upon the province to defray the expense of the upkeep of this last-mentioned part of the building, for which purpose the authorization which in the third decree of the congregation was given to our beloved brother, the provincial master, is renewed.

On November 30, 1880, in another decree of the same governing chapter (Exhibit E-3), the following action was taken:




Prelacy of the Franciscan Friars of the Philippines Decrees of the Venerable Governing Chapter, passed on November 30, 1880.


12th. In view of the provision of the Venerable Governing  Chapter of the Intermediate Chapter, assembled on  December 4, 1871, authorizing our beloved brother and  father provincial to expend such amounts as he may deem  necessary for the repair of our convent of Santa Ana, the  Venerable Governing Chapter advises and charges our beloved  father provincial to have a plan made of the said  convent, on which shall be indicated the part of the building  which shall serve as a dwelling for the parish priest,  in conformity with the agreement made between him and  His Grace, the Archbishop; and authorizing him, furthermore,  to expend such amount as he ay deem necessary,  for the repair of the remainder of the building. left as a  convent belonging to this holy and apostolic province. After  all the foregoing shall have been accomplished, record  shall be made in the minutes to the effect that the said  convent belongs to Our Province of Barefooted Friars of  the Philippines, of which minutes and plan, authenticated  by the proper signatures, our beloved brother shall acquire  a copy and keep it in the archives of the province.




The matter referred to in these two decreed of the Governing  Chapter of the Franciscan Friars, and especially  that mentioned in the first, to wit, the decree of May 31,  1873, having been submitted to the decision of the Very  Reverend Archbishop of Manila, the said Archbishop, Friar  Pedro Payo, on April 19, 1881, addressed to the provincial  of the San Franciscan Order the following communication  (Exhibit D) the original copy of which was presented in  evidence at the trial:




See of Manila
. — On this date I have decreed as follows:




""In view of the record in this case initiated by the communication  received in the 1st instant from the very reverend  father provincial of the San Franciscan Order, residing  in this city; and in view of the data shown on the  plan which accompanies and is a part of the said record;  and whereas, from the historical data contained in the copy  found on pages 1 to 3, the ownership of the Franciscan  Order in the convent of the pueblo of Santa Ana de Sapa  appears in a certain manner to be established; and whereas  the church of the said pueblo has not at the present time  the means whereby to defray the cost of the work made  necessary by reason of the damage occasioned by the last  earthquake; and whereas, considering its bad condition,  especially in the rainy season, if proper repairs to the said  building are not soon made the ruin and destruction of the  convent is almost certain; and whereas account has been  taken of the other reason s adduced in the communication  above mentioned, we therefore hereby accept the cession  of that part of the said convent which is designated on the  accompanying plan, as a dwelling for the parish priest; on  condition that if, through any unforeseen event, the parochial  building should become uninhabitable, the parish  priest shall take designated for the use of the said corporation,  without prejudice to the present parish priest of Santa  Ana de Sapa taking such action as may be required (as a  separate matter and after exhibition, also, of the proper  plan, in the usual manner followed in similar cases), should  his house or convent likewise require repairs. This decree  shall be referred to the very reverend father provincial  of the San Franciscan Order and to the parish priest of Santa Ana, for such action as may he required, and when this has been done, this document shall be placed on file.""




The foregoing is transmitted to your reverence for your  information and for the purposes therein mentioned.


May God guard you reverence for many years. Manila,  April 19, 1881. — (Sgd.) Friar Pedro, Archbishop. —  Very Reverend Father Provincial of the San Franciscan  Order.




As may be seen, the applicant has continually maintained,  or for more than forty years at least, as appears from the  first of the two aforementioned decrees of the governing  chapter of the said order (that of December 6, 1871), that  the convent of the pueblo of Santa Ana de Sapa belonged  to it, and that it has also since then been performing acts  of ownership and disposal in respect to the said building.  It was aware that the Archbishop of Manila might hold  another opinion with regard to the said ownership, because  of the fact that the parish priest of the pueblo was living  in a part of the said building. In order to clear up doubts  and settle the differences between the said order and the  supreme ecclesiastic authority of the Islands upon whom  it devoted to settle the matter, it recommended to the  father provincial of the order that, as soon as possible,  he should enter in writing, into such negotiations as he  might deem necessary to come to a final agreement with  the Archbishop with respect to the part of the convent to  be allotted as a dwelling for the parish priest and the part  thereof to be used for the friars on vacation and as a  dwelling for the aged friars; and it also charged the said  father provincial to mark the division between the said  two parts of the building on a plan, and renewed the authorization  previously granted to defray the cost of the repair  of the last mentioned part of the building, which should be  borne by the province. Later, on November 30, 1880, and  in view of the action decided upon in December, 1871, the  same governing chapter advised and charged the father  provincial to he a plan made of the said convent, on  which should be marked the part of the building that was  to serve as a dwelling for the parish priest, in conformity  with such agreement as might be made by himself and  the Archbishop, and he was authorized to expend such  amount as he might deem necessary for the repair of the  remainder of the building left as a convent belonging to  the said apostolic province. The governing chapter further  provided that, when this was done, record should  be entered in the minutes to the effect that the said convent  ""is a building belonging to our Province of Barefooted  Friars of the Philippines,"" and that the Father Provincial  should keep a copy of the said minutes and plan in the  archives of the province.


The plan referred to in the aforementioned decree, the  same one presented in evidence in the case at bar as Exhibit  D-1, was made one month and a half afterwards  to wit, on January 15, 1881, by the surveyor Puig y Llagostera,  as shown by the plan itself and by the testimony  of one of the friars of the said Franciscan Order, Ramon  Cabiedes (who, from 1872 to 1882 was the parish priest  of the said pueblo of Santa Ana), and Fernando Sanchez  and Tomas Moya, who were respectively the provincial  commissary of the said order and the parish priest of the  said pueblo, both of whom were still acting in the capacities  just mentioned when the complaint was filed and the trial  was commenced. These two witnesses knew of the said  plan and had seen it in the files in the house of the provincial  commissary of the said corporation. This plan or  sketch indicates, as said by its title, the parts belonging  to the convent, church and parochial building of the pueblo  of Santa Ana; there is designated thereon by the letters  A, B, C and D, the division of the building called a convent,  into two parts, one of them, being that which the Franciscan  Corporation was then trying to cede to the church  for a parochial building or dwelling for the parish priest .the last mentioned witness, Tomas Moya, explained all of  these facts in detail at the trial, with the said plan or rough  sketch before him. .


The said plan was drawn and the respective proceedings  commenced in the Archbishop of Manila, as the result of  a communication of April 1, 1881, from the father provincial  of the San Franciscan Order. On the occasion of the  diocesan visit, a conference was held in the Convent of  Santa Ana by Father Pedro Payo, Archbishop of Manila,  and Pedro Moya, father provincial of the San Franciscan  Order. This conference was also attended by Ramon Cabiedes,  the parish priest of the said pueblo, who heard the  explanations and reasons given by both parties just above  mentioned. Subsequently, on the 19th of the same month  of April, the said Archbishop issued the decree above transcribed  and on the same date it was communicated to the  father provincial of the San Franciscan Order. In this  decree as has been seen, after stating that he had examined  the said record of proceedings and the plan thereto attached,  he virtually acknowledged that, from the history related in  the copy attached to the said record of proceedings — a  history which must have been that of the foundation of  the church and the convent of the said pueblo of Santa  Ana — the ownership claimed by the Franciscan Order in  the Convent of Santa Ana de Sapa, was in a certain manner  established. He further stated that he had taken into account  the other reasons advanced in the aforementioned  communication from the father provincial, and terminated  by saying: ""We consequently accept the cession of that  part of the said convent, which, intended as a dwelling for  the parish priest, is designated on the attached plan;"" and,  in prevision of the possibility of the parochial building becoming  uninhabitable as a result of some unforeseen contingency,  he wished to have the rule established that the parish priest should lodge in one of the apartments assigned for the use of the said Franciscan Corporation, without prejudice to his taking the necessary action, as a separate matter (upon exhibition of the proper plan in the manner usually followed in similar cases) for the repair of his house or convent, should it require repair.


The Archbishop of Manila, the, approved the division  into two parts of the building called the convent of the  pueblo of Santa Ana, in the manner appearing on the plan  Exhibit D-1, drawn by the surveyor Puig y Llagostera on  January 15, 1881, by order of the governing council of the  San Franciscan Order, issued on November 30, 1880, for  the purpose of arriving at a definite understanding with the  Archbishop in regard to what part of the said convent  should be assigned as a dwelling for the parish priest an  what part of it was to be used by the aged friars and the  friars on vacation. The two parts aforementioned were  divide and were designated letters A, B, C and D.  The Archbishop accepted the division and explicitly recognized  that the Franciscan's ownership of the convent was  established and by that acknowledgment accepted the cession  of the part which, intended as a dwelling for the parish  priest, was designated on the said plan and had been made  by the Franciscan Corporation to the Archbishop of Manila.  It cannot be said that this acknowledgment of the  ownership of the Franciscan Order in the convent was not  explicit and positive merely because of the statement in  the said decree that its ownership appeared  in a certain manner established, because the fact of the  archbishop's acceptance of the cession of that part of the  convent as a dwelling for the parish priest, after recognizing  the ownership of the applicant corporation in the  whole building, shows that the Archbishop was convinced  that the grantor of the said part of the building was the  proprietor or owner of the convent, for, if he had entertained  any doubt on this point, exercising, as he did, the  supreme authority of the Church in these Islands, he could  have refused to accept the cession or could have postponed  the determination of the matter by providing that the  parish priest of the pueblo should continue to reside in  the convent, as he had been doing since the erection of that  building and of the church, especially since the parish was  then governed, as it has always been, by a member of the  San Franciscan Order.


It is, therefore, indisputable that the Archbishop of Manila,  well versed in the history of the church and convent  of Santa Ana, mentioned by him in his decree, and in view  of all the data shown in the record, considered it a matter  of strict justice to recognize the ownership of the Franciscan  Corporation in the convent, and acquiesced in the  cession made by the said corporation of a part of the said  convent to the Church to be used as a parochial building or  dwelling for the very reason that, according to the testimony  of Father Ramon Cabiedes (who at the time of the  cession was, and for ten years previously had been, the  parish priest of the pueblo of Santa Ana) although the  parish priest was a member of the San Franciscan Order,  he depended, as such, on the Archbishop and, at the same  time, as a regular he was under the orders of the provincial.  So that, as the trial court said, there ought to have been  in that pueblo a building for the parish priest, or parochial  building, of the Catholic community of that district of Santa  Ana, but as there was no such building (because the Franciscan  Corporation maintained that the building called the  Convent of Santa Ana belonged to the said corporation and  not to the Roman Catholic Church of the Philippines) the  Archbishop of Manila, the supreme chief or head of the  church, recognizing these facts and desiring that the Catholic  community of that district should not continue to be  without a parochial building of its own, accepted the cession  which the said Franciscan Corporation saw fit to make  of a part of its property in the convent building of Santa  Ana to the Roman Catholic Church of the Philippines.


Before the cession was made, the work of the repair of  the entire building, known as the Convent of Santa Ana,  had been accomplished at the expense of the applicant corporation,  and among such repairs, those made necessary by  the earthquakes of the year 1880. The cost of all these  repairs amounted to several thousand pesos and was paid  by the 
Procurador General 
of the said corporation, according  to the testimony of Friar Ramon Cabiedes, who was  then the parish priest of the said pueblo. After the cession  had been made, the repair work on the church and the  part of the edifice intended as a parochial building or dwelling  of the parish priest, was defrayed out of the funds of  the parochial church itself, that is, the so-called building  funds, which were in the custody of the parish priest, after  the latter had been expressly authorized by the Archbishop,  as appears from the documents Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6 (presented  by the objector itself) in connection with the testimony  of said witnesses Friar Ramon Cabiedes and Friar  Tomas Moya. Since then all the repair work done on the  part of the convent intended as a dwelling for the aged  priests and the priests on vacation, of the San Franciscan  Order, and which had been reserved by the applicant corporation  for itself out of its property — some of which  repairs were quite extensive, such as the tearing down of  certain walls, the strengthening of others, and the construction  of four cloisters in that part of the building — all of  these works and repairs, we repeat, were paid for by the  office of the 
Procurador general 
of the order, that is, by  the province of San Francisco, and not out of the funds of  the Archbishop of Manila, or those of the roman Catholic  Church of the Philippines, or of the parochial church of the  said pueblo. These payments were made without any prior  authorization from the Archbishop of Manila, only that  given by the provincial of the said order, as is likewise  shown by the document Exhibit E and the testimony of the  aforenamed witnesses, by that of Friar Gilberto Martin,  formerly the commissary provincial of the San Franciscan  Order, and by that of Gregorio Flores, who performed some  of the said work under the instructions of the said father  provincial, and, as he testified, collected the amounts due  therefor from the
 procurador 
of the said corporation.


The separation of the part of the Santa Ana convent building intended as a parochial house and the part which the Franciscan Corporation had retained for the use and benefit of its members was so far accomplished that in the year 1907, while Friar Fernando Sanchez was the commissary provincial of the said order, Silvino Tunon, the acting ecclesiastical governor of the Islands during the absence of the Archbishop of Manila from the Islands, asked permission of said Father Provincial to allow the young seminarist of the diocese to pass a few days' vacation in the part of the convent reserved for the Corporation; this petition having been referred to the Provincial Governing Chapter of the San Franciscan Order, the said chapter refused its consent because, besides already having granted permission to the Dominican Corporation to send the Dominican priests on vacation there, the said San Franciscan Order itself needed that part of the building for its sick and for those of its members who intended to pass their vacations in the said convent.


Notwithstanding all the facts aforestated, which go to  prove the ratification by the Roman Catholic Archbishop  of Manila, that is, the objector, of his acknowledgement of  the applicant's ownership in the part of the Santa Ana  Convent that was excluded from the cession to the Roman  Catholic Church as a parochial building of the pueblo of  Santa Ana, and which the applicant had retained for itself,  and, consequently, also its ownership in the land on which  that part of the said building is erected, the lower court  concludes that the said land belongs to the Santa Ana  parochial church from the fact, as it states, that the parish  priest of the same, on July 18, 1906, solicited and obtained  from the Archbishop of Manila authorization to incur an  expense of P250, the estimated cost for the survey of the  land belonging to the church of the said district or suburb,  the drawing of the plan thereof and the registration fees  of the land court, for the purpose of registering the said  land, under which authorization, according to the court,  the plan Exhibit A was drawn. This plan comprises not  only the land occupied by a part of the convent but also  all the land pertaining to the church and convent.


It is true that in a communication of July 18, 1906, presented  in evidence at the trial as Exhibit 1, the parish  priest of Santa Ana asked for the approval of the said  estimated expense of P250, not for the survey and drawing  of the plan ""of the land belonging to the church of the  said suburb,"" as incorrectly stated in the judgement appealed  from, but for preparing a plan ""
of all the lands 
that  belong to this church of Santa Ana,"" as stated in the said  communication itself, and to register the property anew,  in conformity with the new laws, so as to avoid litigation.  So that the said petition was for authority to expend P250,  the estimated cost, not of their survey and plan of the land  belonging to the church of that suburb, but ""for the survey  of all the lands owned by the said church,"" and this petition  was addressed by the parish priest of Santa Ana to  the Archbishop of Manila, as the matter concerned property  of the said church. But the following appeared in the  decree publishing the said authorization granted by the  Archbishop on the following day, July 19, 1906:




Having considered the petition made in the preceding  communication from the reverend parish priest of the  suburb of Santa Ana of this city, we hereby approve the  expenditure of P250, which will be the cost of the survey  of the land belonging to the church of the said suburb, of  the plan of the said land and of the fees of the Court of  Land Registration; provided, however, that such expenses  shall be paid out of the parochial funds in his charge.




In employing the words ""land belonging to the church of the said suburb,"" instead of ""all lands belonging to the church of the said suburb"" the Archbishop made a mistake, as the petition of the parish priest of Santa Ana referred to all these lands.


Now then, as appears from a statement made by the  objector's own counsel during the trial, this corporation  did in fact bring proceedings in the Court of Land Registration,  under docket number 5790, to obtain the registration  of those properties of the Santa Ana Church and in  those proceedings the plan drawn by virtue of the foregoing  authority was used. In the said proceedings the Franciscan  Corporation, the herein applicant, was the objector.  As stated by the same counsel and that of the applicant  corporation, those proceedings were pending when the present  case, No. 8438, was heard; in the latter it is to be seen  that the Franciscan Corporation is the applicant and the  Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, a unipersonal corporation,  the objector. in the present proceedings the plan  Exhibit A was also presented but the application, as already  said in the beginning, only referred to the lot E-1 or the  part of the land on which stands that part of the Santa  Ana Convent which the Franciscan Corporation reserved  to itself after having ceded the other part to the Church,  represented by the Archbishop, for a parochial building.  the dotted lines on the said plan Exhibit A were, by stipulation  of the parties and at the petitioner's request, written  thereon by the Bureau of Public Lands, in order to determine,  approximately, the limits of the building shown on  the plan D, which must be the Exhibit D-1 aforementioned  and which served as a basis for the cession accepted by the  Archbishop of Manila in his decreed of April 19, 1881, — a  division which was also clearly determined at the trial by  the same surveyor who drew the said plan, Carlos N. Francisco,  when examining and comparing that plan with  Exhibit D-1.


Therefore, the authority of the Archbishop of Manila  referred to by the trial court was not requested by the  applicant corporation, but by the parish priest of Santa  Ana; it was not requested for the drawing of the plan  and the survey of the land belonging to the church of the  said pueblo, as the lower court understood in referring to  the land sought to be registered by the Franciscan Corporation,  but to all the land owned by the church of the  said pueblo; but in his authorization the Archbishop referred  to the land that belonged to the Church — thus  evidently making a mistake because the petition of the parish  priest and this authorization are clearly incongruous.  This mistake is proved by the fact of the Archbishop of  Manila having commenced the said proceedings, No. 5790,  to secure the registration of the lands belonging to the  Santa Ana church, in which proceedings the herein applicant  corporation was an objector on account of the inclusion  of the said lot E-1 in the said plan as a part of those  properties; while in turn the Franciscan Corporation commenced  the present proceedings in which the application  included only a part of the land described in that plan,  that is, the land designated as lot E-1, the objector this  time being the unipersonal corporation, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila.


The following facts, to wit, the parish priest of Santa  Ana having asked authority from the Archbishop to incur  the necessary expenses of inscribing in the property registry the lands belonging to the church of the said pueblo; of the  Archbishop having granted this authorization, at the same  time stating that it should be understood that the said expenses  should be defrayed out of the parochial funds in his  custody; and of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila  having commenced proceedings No. 5790 for the registration  of these lands, utilizing the plan drawn the reason of the  aforementioned authorization, — proceedings in which the  Franciscan Corporation was the objector, — in themselves  prove that it cannot logically be inferred from them, as the  lower court erroneously judged, that the land in question  belongs to the parochial church of Santa Ana. Far from  warranting the deduction that the Franciscan Corporation  recognized such ownership, those facts show that it did not,  in any manner, acquiesce in the registration in behalf of the  parochial church of Santa Ana, among those lands of the  land on which is erected the part of the convent that it had  reserved for itself when it ceded to the Archbishop of Manila  the other part of the convent as the parochial building  of the said pueblo.


It is undeniable that the applicant, by the fact of having been since time immemorial in the peaceable, continuous and uninterrupted possession of the land on which the Convent of Santa Ana stands (although not proven to be the founder of the convent and church there) has acquired title of ownership in the said land by prescription; and that title was expressly recognized by the objector, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, in an official document, the decree of April 18, [19] 1881, in accepting the cesion of a part of the said convent (and, consequently, of the land on which the said part of the convent is erected) which the applicant made to him as the supreme head of the Roman Catholic Church of the Philippines.


The acceptance of the cession of a part of a property duly tendered by a person whom the cessionary recognized to be the owner thereof, and by reason of which recognition the cession is accepted, is proof of the acknowledgment of another's property rights.


This acknowledgment by the cessionary estops him form afterwards denying or attacking the title of the owner because it is a principle of law that no one may validly repudiate his own acts.




It is a principle of universal application that admission, whether of law or of fact, which have been acted on by others are conclusive against the party making them in all cases between him and the party whose conduct he has influenced, and that a man shall not be permitted to repudiate his own representations. (Toppan vs. Cleveland C .& C. R. Co., Fed. Cas. No. 14,099.)




In the case of 
Bismorte vs. Aldecoa & Co. 
(17 Phil. Rep., 480) in which the foregoing principle is cited, this court said:




Title to realty; estoppel
. — If a party receives real property from another and obtains title to the same upon the theory that such party was the owner, the purchaser is estopped from later denying the ownership. A contract which is based upon the theory that one of the parties thereto is the owner of the property involved will estop the parties, or the party alleging the fact if it be the act of but one (in the performance of the contract), from claiming a different title.


The doctrine of equitable estoppel is frequently applied  to transactions in which it is found that it would be unconscionable  to permit a person to maintain a position inconsistent  with one in which he has acquiesced or of which he  has accepted any benefit. . . . And so also the acceptance  of any benefit from a transaction or contract, with  knowledge or notice of the facts and rights, will create an  estoppel. (Ruling Case Law, vol. 10, p. 694, sec. 22, and  decisions therein cited.)




As the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, the objector,  accepted the cession tendered by the applicant of a  part of the Santa Ana Convent for a parochial building for  the pueblo of Santa Ana — an accepted it not only on the  theory, but also by the explicit acknowledgment, that the applicant  was the only owner of the convent, and, consequently, of  the land on which it is erected — and benefited by this cession,  he cannot, under any principle of justice and equity, continue  to enjoy the benefit and to retain the part of the convent  ceded to him, and, consequently, the land on which said  portion of the convent stands, and deny what he accepted  as the basis of the acceptance of the cession, to wit, the  applicant's ownership of the whole building and of the land  on which it is erected, a part of which is the land in question.  The terms of the said document have the value of a  contract between the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila  and the Franciscan Corporation; both parties thereto are  mutually bound to comply with them and it is unlawful for  either to fail to fulfill its stipulations. If the objector is  the owner of a part of the property by reason of sa title conferred  upon him by the party who, as it maintains, had such  title in order to have been able to cede the said part, said  objector cannot be permitted to deny or to refuse to recognize  the legality and validity of this title.


Therefore, the opposition of the unipersonal corporation, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, to the registration of the land described in petitioner's application and specified in the plan Exhibit A as lot E-1 is in all respects improper and without merit. By the testimony of the witnesses Friar Ramon Cabiedes and Friar Tomas Moya, and particularly by that of the surveyor Carlos N. Francisco who drew the said plan, and view of the plan Exhibit D-1, there was designated at the trial the part of the land desired to be registered by the applicant, corresponding to the part of the building called the Santa Ana Convent, intended as a dwelling for the aged priests and the priests of the San Franciscan Order on vacation; but as the said part and that ceded to the Archbishop of Manila for the parochial building of that pueblo form one single structure, and as the limits of both these parts were only approximately determined on the plan Exhibit A, in connection with the plan Exhibit D-1, by the Bureau of Public Lands, at the applicant's petition, as stated at the trial by the attorneys for both parties, such determination should be made in a precise manner and exact manner, for the purpose of the issuance of the proper title to the applicant.


For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment appealed  from and hold that the applicant corporation is  entitled to register the land described in its application and  in the plan accompanying the same, Exhibit A, thus dismissing  the opposition of the unipersonal corporation, the  Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila ,thereto, without  special findings as to the costs of both instances. Within  a reasonable period to be fixed by the court the parties shall,  before registration, precisely and accurately determine the  part of the land that corresponds to each of them, as  well as the true boundaries between both properties, and  should they not do so within the said period, then the court  shall determine the area and boundaries, taking account of  such data as it may deem necessary for this purpose. So  ordered.
