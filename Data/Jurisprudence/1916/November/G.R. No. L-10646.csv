ARAULLO, 
J.:


In a written complaint of the date of May 20, 1911, the  plaintiffs prayed to the Court of First Instance of Pampanga  to declare them to be the owners of the pro indiviso half of  the properties described therein with the costs against the  defendant. They alleged, in effect, that they were the  owners of the said
 pro indiviso 
half of the properties referred  to, and that the defendant claimed to have a right in  the said properties and was detaining them. They also  prayed the court to appoint Lorenzo Lising as guardian 
ad  litem 
for the plaintiff minors Eusebia, Lucas and Felisa  Angeles and Julita Simbulan, which appointment was made.


On July 8, 1911, the defendant answered the complaint.  He admitted the third allegation contained therein, to wit,  the relative to the minority of the above-named persons,  and, after entering a general and specific denial of the other  allegations, excepting the one a description of  the said properties, interposed two special defenses, to wit:  (1) That on April 12, 1881, Isidoro Espino and his wife  Martina Cabigting executed a joint will before the 
gobernadorcillo 
of Arayat, Pampanga, with all the formalities prescribed  by law; that this will was duly forwarded to the  
alcalde mayor 
of the said province and was by him protocolized  on the 13th of April of the same year (a copy thereof  was attached to the complaint as an integral part of the  said answer and first defense); that in the sixth clause  of this will, the spouses Isidoro Espino and Martina Cabigting  mutually named themselves as heirs, in such manner  that the surviving spouse should inherit from the deceased  consort; that in the said sixth clause and also in the last  clause of the will the said testators referred to a certain  testamentary note of codicil contained and kept in a closed  envelope signed by the 
gobernadorcillo
; that, Isidoro Espino  having died on October 2, 1882, his widow Martina Cabigting,  by virtue of the said will, succeeded to and accepted  all the property that constituted the estate left by  the said deceased. (2) That on April 9, 1909, Martina  Cabigting executed her last will in Arayat, Pampanga,  which will was duly authenticated and probated by the said  Court of First Instance of Pampanga (a copy whereof was  attached to the defendant's answer as an integral part of  the same and of his second special defense); that Martina  Cabigting, in clause 5 of her said will, made a list of her  property and a statement of the manner in which she had acquired it, and in clause 3 thereof described the parcel of  land that her deceased husband had brought to their marriage;  that in clause 6 of her said will Martina Cabigting  bequeathed to her husband's nephews and nieces the only  parcel of land brought by him to the marriage and instituted  Gabina Medina y Cabigting, the defendant's wife, as  the universal heir of her estate; and finally, in none of the  remaining testamentary clauses did the testatrix appoint  any other heirs or legatees, nor did she transfer any right whatever in the said property to any of the plaintiffs. The defendant therefore prayed the court to absolve him from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.


On July 20, 1911, the plaintiffs filed their reply in which  under oath they denied the authenticity and the due execution  of the joint will of Isidoro Espino and his wife Martina  Cabigting, and stated that if the said joint will ever existed,  it was afterwards revoked by the said Martina Cabigting,  and that it never had been probated; that the property described  in the complaint was community property, acquired  by Isidoro Espino and Martina Cabigting during their  marriage; that the former, Isidoro Espino, died intestate,  leaving the plaintiffs as heirs to the one-half of the said  property that pertained to him, and his widow, Martina  Cabigting, as heir to the usufructuary share allowed her by  law; and that, finally, as the latter had died, the property of  which she had the usufruct should revert to the plaintiff.


Subsequently the plaintiff requested that Balbino Cabigting,  Encarnacion Abad, Antonio Abad, Elacio Cabigting,  Teodoro Abad, Conrado Abad, Rita Abad, and Jose Cabigting  be included as plaintiffs, and at the same time asked for  the appointment of a guardian 
ad litem 
for the five last-named,  they being minors; for this purpose they proposed  the name of Lorenzo Lising. They also requested  that a stone masonry 
camarin 
be included among the properties  described in the complaint. After the case had been  heard and both parties had introduced their respective evidence,  the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, on June  9, 1913, rendered judgment by absolving the defendant from  the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs. The  judgment was founded on the following grounds:




The defendant's allegations are perfectly proven by the  evidence. On April 12, 1881, Isidoro Espino and his wife  Martina Cabigting Balagtas executed a joint will before the  
gobernadorcillo 
of Arayat, Pampanga. This will was duly  protocolized on April 13, 1881 (defendant's Exhibit 1). In  said will each spouse named the other as heir. Isidoro  Espino died in 1882, under this will. On April 9, 1909,  Martina Cabigting executed a will, which was duly probated  by this Court of First Instance of Pampanga on July 8,  1910, wherein she instituted as her sole and universal heir  her niece Gabina Medina y Cabigting, the defendant's wife.


Under the joint will of April 12, 1881, one that was perfectly  valid in accordance with the previous laws, Martina  Cabigting succeeded to all the property, rights and actions  of her husband, Isidoro Espino. Martina Cabigting being  the owner of the said property was free to dispose of it,  as she did in her will of April 9, 1909. Therefore, even  supposing the property specified in the complaint to be community  property, Martina Cabigting had a perfect right to  transfer her ownership thereof, as she did, to the defendant's  wife.




The plaintiff's excepted to the said judgment and moved for a new trial. Upon the denial of this motion they also excepted to the ruling and by the proper bill of exceptions appealed the case to this Supreme Court. In their brief they make the following assignments of errors:


(1)	In holding that the joint will executed by Isidoro Espino  and his wife Martina Cabigting on April 12, 1881, was  valid; (2) in holding that by virtue of the said joint will  Martina Cabigting succeeded to all the property, rights and  actions of her husband Isidoro Espino; (3) in not holding  that the said joint will was revoked by another that was  executed by Martina Cabigting on June 13, 1889, before the  notary public Genaro Heredia; (4) in holding that Martina  Cabigting was free to dispose of the property, rights and  actions of her said husband Isidoro Espino; (5) in not holding  that the plaintiffs are entitled to one-half of the property  described in the complaint; and (6) in absolving the defendant  from the complaint. .


In the will executed on April 12, 1881, by Isidoro Espino  and his wife Martina Cabigting, they mutually named each  other as heirs, so that upon the death of either spouse the  survivor should inherit the property of the other. This will  was protocolized on the following day, the 13th, in the  public registry of the Province of Pampanga, by order of  the 
alcalde mayor 
of the said province. In accordance with  the law then in force this will was duly probated by means  of this protocolization, and on Isidoro Espino's death in  the following year, 1882, it was carried into effect and the  said Espino's widow acquired full ownership of all property  that had belonged to the deceased.


On June 13, 1889, Martina Cabigting, being then a  widow, executed a will before the notary public Genaro  Heredia; but on April 9, 1909, she executed another, in  which, as in the previous one, she named her niece Gabina  Medina Cabigting as her sole and universal heir.


A joint will was allowed by law 9, title 6 of the book 3 of the  
Fuero Real
, but only between the husband and wife who  had no children (sucesion) and the Partidas, as Manresa  says in his work entitled 
Commentaries on the Civil Code
,  declared it to be null and void, in order that neither of the  testators ""might be induced to bring about the other's death  for the purpose of inheriting his or her property.""


This form of will continued to be used, however, and  gave rise to many questions and suits which, according to  Manresa, the supreme court of Spain had to decide, and  undoubtedly was sanctioned by use, notwithstanding the  prohibition contained in the Partidas, for rule 2 of the  transitory provisions of the civil Code now in force, reads:




Acts and contract entered into under the 
regime 
of  the preceding legislation, and which are valid according  to the same shall produce all their effects according to  the same legislation, with the limitations set forth in these  rules. Therefore, last wills, even when jointly executed;  powers of attorney to execute wills and testamentary notes,  executed or written before this Code was in force, shall be  valid; and the clause 
ad cautelam
, the trusts (
 fideicomisos
)  for applying the estate in accordance with the secret instructions  of the testator, and any other acts, prescribed  by the preceding legislation, shall be effective; but the  revocation or modification of these acts or of any of the  clauses contained in the same, shall not be effective, after  this Code has been enforced, except by making the testament  according to the same.




Besides this positive provision of the Code, in which,  as is seen, last wills, even joint ones, which were executed  or written before this Code came into force, are valid, the  supreme court of Spain, in a case where the execution and  putting into force of a will of this kind were called into  question, held in its decision of April 9, 1904:




That a joint will executed under the legislation in force  prior to the enactment of the Civil Code, is valid according  to that legislation and shall produce all its effects, without  other limitations than those established in the transitory  provisions of the said code, the twelfth of which does not  alter the power of the testator to instruct the testamentary  executors, appointed with joint powers, to effect the partition,  because this provision, in providing that the estate  of a person who dies after the Code shall have gone into  effect, whether such person leaves a will or not, shall be  adjudicated and distributed according to the Code, refers  only to the manner of making the partition and to the  amounts into which the inheritance should be distributed,  as shown very clearly by the last paragraph of the said  transitory provision.




There cannot, therefore, be the slightest doubt that the  joint will executed by Isidoro Espino and his wife Martina  Cabigting is valid and that by reason thereof Martina  Cabigting, who survived her said husband, succeeded to all  his property, rights and actions.


Martina Cabigting's last will was that executed on April 9, 1909, under the provisions of Act No. 190 now in force.  On February 19, 1910, the testatrix died and this will was  probated by the Court of First Instance of Pampanga on  July 8th of the same year, the will executed by her on  June 13, 1889, being therefore of no value or effect whatever.  Moreover, the said testatrix, by her said last will,  that of April, 1909, expressly annulled and revoked the  one previously mentioned, or that of June 13, 1889, and  as this latter will could not produce no effect whatever, it  follows the court did not err, as the appellant maintains  that it did, in not holding that the joint will executed by  Martina Cabigting and her husband Isidoro Espino in  April, 1881, was revoked by the will of June 13, 1889.


After Isidoro Espino and his wife Martina Cabigting  had mutually named the other as his and her heir in their  will of April 12, 1881, in such manner that, as they stated  in the 6th clause thereof, whichever survived the other  should succeed to the decedent's estate, they added the  following provision:




And when the latter also dies, we provide that he (or  she) be succeeded in whatever estate he (or she) may  leave, by the persons named in the testamentary note or  codicil that we have written, under the condition therein  stated.




And in clause 8 of the said will they make further  statement:
lawphil.net




In case that the persons instituted in the codicil, should  die before that one of us who survives the other, the said  surviving spouse may name as his or her heirs whomsoever  he or she may see fit, under the same condition as the said  persons mentioned in the codicil.




Martina Cabigting, then, did not accept the estate left  by her husband Isidoro Espino under instructions from  him to transmit all of it to the person appointed in the  said testamentary note or codicil, that is, as the fiduciary  heir of her deceased husband, since in the said sixth clause  it was set forth that they should be succeeded, in whatever  might be left by the one that survived the other, by the  persons named in the testamentary note. Therefore, the  surviving spouse was left at liberty to enjoy and dispose  of the property he or she might inherit from the other,  and was under no obligation with regard to 
what 
property  the said surviving spouse should bequeath to the persons  named in the codicil or testamentary note.


There is non evidence whatever that the plaintiffs or any  of them were the persons named in the said codicil to succeed  Martina Cabigting, nor is there any proof that one  of those persons was not the heir named by Martina Cabigting  in her last will, to wit, that of January 9, 1909,  nor that those persons had already died when Martina Cabigting  executed her last will. Therefore the latter was at  liberty to name Gabina Medina Cabigting as her heir.


In clause 9 of the said last will, that of April 9, 1909,  Martina Cabigting stated that she annulled and revoked  every testamentary provision that she had made before that  date, especially the will of April 12, 1881, executed jointly  with her husband, and that of June 13, 1889, as aforesaid.  The testatrix made no special mention of any revocation  of the testamentary note referred to in the first of the  said wills.
lawphil.net


In fact, Martina Cabigting could have revoked the said joint will and the testamentary note of codicil therein mentioned.


The supreme court of Spain on March 1, 1905, rendered  a decision in a case which involved the revocation by the  surviving wife of a joint will executed by her and her  husband in which they mutually named the other as heir.  Said will provided that whichever of them should outlive  the other should enter into the possession and enjoyment  of all the property that belonged to the decedent, whether  derived from the capital brought to the marriage, earnings  realized during the same, property inherited or which might  be inherited in the future, or derived from any other source;  that this appointment or reciprocal institution was made  with the conditions and limitations that neither of them  might, without the consent of the other, change or alter  the will except where the other spouse specially authorized  such alteration or change; that otherwise the appointment  should be null and void; that the surviving spouse could  not alienate, encumber, or dispose in any manner of the  real estate, except in a case of necessity recognized to be  such by a judge of competent jurisdiction and after his  permission to do so should first have been obtained, and  that said judge should deny such permission if the surviving  spouse should have contracted a second marriage. The  testators made various legacies and appointed their nephew  as their sole and universal heir to all the remainder of their  property. The court said:




There is no statute or legal doctrine that provides that  a will jointly executed by husband and wife shall be irrevocable.  On the contrary, it is a principle constantly maintained  by the supreme court, in accordance with the provisions  of laws 1 to 25, title 1, sixth partida, and art. 747  of the Civil Code, that the record of two last wills in one  and the same instrument is a circumstance which neither  imposes a reciprocal contract nor deprives the wills of their  essential quality of being susceptible of alteration until  the death of either of the testators in the part disposed of  by either of them and in so far as they relate to the property  and rights pertaining to each.




Martina Cabigting, by virtue of then joint will executed  by her and her husband on April 12, 1881, inherited the  latter's property (of what this property consisted the said  will does not specify) and had ample and full power to  enjoy and dispose freely of it as her own. She was not  obliged to transmit it to the persons named in the said  testamentary note or codicil, except such part thereof  as she might leave or which remained at her death. But  this will was revoked by the last will of April 9, 1909,  and admitting that this revocation included the testamentary  note or codicil, her appointment as heir, made by her  husband with regard to his property which, as before said,  came to belong to Martina Cabigting, remained unaffected;  and as by virtue of the revocation of that first will and  of its codicil she could, consequently, freely dispose of that  and also her own property in favor of whatever person  she pleased, it is evident that her action in the will of  January 9, 18909, in devising all her property to her niece  Gabina Medina Cabigting, is perfectly valid and legal, and  the plaintiffs have no right whatever in the said property,  for, as stipulated at the trial. they are the direct descendants  of the brother and sisters of Isidoro Espino, and,  consequently, not being the forced heirs of the said deceased  Espino, the latter could freely dispose, as he did  in the said will of April 12, 1881, of the private property  he then owned, in favor of his wife Martina Cabigting.


On the other hand, in clause 3 of the last will, that of  April 9, 1909, the testatrix specified the properties that her  husband Isidoro Espino had brought to the marriage and  she made a detailed statement of other properties. In  clause 5 she declared that she was then the absolute owner  of them on account of her having inherited some from  her parents and having acquired others by her own labor  and industry during the period of her widowhood. These  properties she bequeathed to her niece Gabina Cabigting,  the daughter of her sister Cornelia and the wife of Alejandro  Samia, as her sole and universal heir.


There is no evidence that any of the properties specified  by the testatrix in the said will as being of her absolute  ownership was either community property or the private  property of her husband Isidoro Espino. The fact that  Martina Cabigting became a widow in 1882 and died in  1910, and executed the said will on April 9, 1909, constitutes,  on the contrary, proof that during the 27 years  that she lived after her husband's death, that is, during  her widowhood, as she herself stated in her will, she acquired  some of these properties by her own labor and industry,  aside from those she inherited from her parents.


Moreoever, the testatrix bequeathed in her said will to  the nephews and nieces of her deceased husband the only  properties which, as she stated in clause 3, he had brought  to his marriage with her and which she had inherited  from him by virtue of the will executed on April 12, 1881,  to wit, the one reciprocally executed by both of them on  the said date. These properties consisted in a parcel of  rice land of about ten cavanes of seed. At all events and  on the supposition, which is incorrect, that these properties  continued to belong to the estate of Isidoro Espino  notwithstanding his having instituted his wife Martina  Cabigting as his heir in the mutual will of June 13, 1881,  they are the only ones that might correspond to the nephews  and nieces of the said deceased Espino.


For the foregoing reasons, as the trial court did not  incur any of the errors assigned by the appellant in his  brief and as the judgment appealed from is in accordance  with the law and the evidence, the judgment is affirmed  with the costs against the appellants. So ordered.
