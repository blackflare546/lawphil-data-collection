1993,May,"G.R. No. 102314	May 26, 1993","LEA O. CAMUS, petitioner,vs.THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, CONRADO S. DAVID and DAVID MOTORS and MARKETING CORPORATION, respondents.Juan E. Mabbayad, Jr. for petitioner.Antonio B. Fidelito for private respondents.MELO,J.:Both the trial and appellate courts construed the transaction effected between herein petitioner and private respondent on May 20, 1986 as an absolute sale of a piece of realty, but petitioner thinks otherwise, saying that it was a mere equitable mortgage. Hence, the petition at bar.Respondent court briefly narrated the background of the case which petitioner did not bother to assail in her pleadings before this Court, thus:On May 20, 1986, the parties, with plaintiff-appellant as vendor and defendant-appellee David Motors and Marketing Corporation (DMMC, for brevity) through its representative, defendant-appellee David, executed by and between themselves a ""Deed of Absolute Sale of Real Property"" over a parcel of land (Lot 7-B of the Subd. plan (LRC) psd-324403, approved as a non-subd. proj. being a portion of Lot 7 (LRC) Pcs-16468 LRC Rec. No. 5941), including all improvements thereon, situated in the barrio of  Hen. T. de Leon, Municipality of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, containing an area of Six Hundred Thirty One (631) square meters, more or less, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 119038 of the Registry of Deeds of Caloocan City, and for and in consideration of One Hundred Fifty Thousand (P150,000.00) Pesos (Exhibit ""B"" also Exhibit ""2"").On November 27, 1987, plaintiff-appellant filed the instant complaint, praying for the annulment of the subject deed of absolute sale and consequent cancellation of the certificate of title obtained by defendants-appellees by virtue thereof; the interpretation and declaration of the subject deed of absolute sale as an equitable mortgage; and for a writ of preliminary injunction (Record, pp. 1-38).In their answer, defendants-appellees, contended that the subject encumbrance was one of absolute sale (Record, pp. 51-70).After trial on the merits, the lower court rendered the impugned decision . . . (p. 62,Rollo.)In her memorandum, petitioner hastened to add a few more details on how the so-called sale in favor of private respondent evolved. According to petitioner, she previously mortgaged the same parcel of land on July 23, 1985 to Mrs. Macaria Dimafelis. Before the mortgage matured, she had to look for other sources from whom she can borrow money to liquidate the mortgage and this financial constraint led to her being introduced to Conrado S. David, herein private respondent, through one Natividad de Gula. It was in the office of private respondent where petitioner impressed that idea of utilizing the mortgaged lot as collateral for the loan which she wanted to obtain from private respondent.In response to the request, private respondent allegedly agreed to extend the loan subject to the following terms:a)	the gross principal amount of the indebtedness shall be P150,000.00;b)	repayment period will be two years with an automatic grace period of one month;c)	interest shall ten percent a month payable monthly;d)	the transaction shall be denominated as an absolute sale instead of a real estate mortgage; and thate)	out of the proceeds of the loan, P40,000.00 will be retained by private respondent as payment for a two months advance interest (P30,000.00 at P15,000.00 interest a month) and the remaining sum of P10,000.00 will be for documentation expense.Petitioner claims that she was initially reluctant to express her conformity but she nonetheless agreed to the conditions after she was supposedly assured by private respondent that the nomenclature attached to their transaction was a mere formality and that petitioner had no reason to be apprehensive inasmuch as private respondent will register the deed of conveyance only if petitioner does not pay the monthly interest. Petitioner signed the ""Deed of Absolute Sale"" and surrendered the owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title after private respondent issued a check in the amount of P109,000.00 to Mrs. Dimafelis as full settlement of petitioner's previous indebtedness. For her part, petitioner received P1,000.00 in cash and was made to sign a cash voucher to show that she received P150,000.00. Further, payment of the interest for four months was allegedly made to private respondent, who did not issue any receipt therefor, until petitioner discovered, to her dismay, that the instrument was registered which triggered the issuance of a new certificate of title in the name of respondent corporation.All of the foregoing statements were derived by petitioner from her open court declarations when she sat on the witness stand in order to develop the theory that the entire scheme was a simple loan accommodation.But the trial court was far from convinced by petitioner's disquisition and neither was respondent court which concurred with the factual observation of the court of origin that gross inadequacy of price had not been sufficiently demonstrated. In interpreting the covenant as an absolute transmission of dominion in favor of private respondent, Justices Aldecoa, Jr., Campos, and Felimon Mendoza were in unison when they declared that none of the badges of an equitable mortgage under Article 1602 of the Civil Code can be appreciated ""in favor of herein petitioner (p. 68,Rollo).Of particular significance to the resolution of the question on the true character of the disputed transaction are the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the contracting parties which have been translated into testimonial evidence in the course of the trial on the merits. Indeed, this specie of evidentiary proof, known as the Parol Evidence Rule, may well be the acknowledged adjective norm that can spell the difference between successor failure of the instant petition (Macapinlac vs. Gutierrez Repide, 43 Phil. 770 [1922]: Cuyugan vs. Santos, 34 Phil. 100 [1916]). For there can be a better appreciation of the problem at hand only if we resort to what the parties had already emphasized below to buttress their respective contentions and in this respect, the decision of respondent court seems a bit deficient considering that it relied more on the alleged sufficiency of the purchase price (p. 66,Rollo) and the bare fact that petitioner, who was accompanied by her ""businesswoman daughter"", could not have been duped into accepting private respondent's offer to purchase the property (p. 67,Rollo).We concede that on these two aspects, we do not occupy a superior position to brush aside what respondent court, arrived at but the so-called adequacy of the consideration, pegged at P150,000.00 by private respondent himself (p. 33,Rollo) for a 631 square meter lot, and the impression of petitioner's willingness to absolutely part with her possession, do not necessarily diminish the existence of other circumstances under Article 1602 of the Civil Code.Verily, petitioner endeavored to demonstrate her financial constraint and the need to pay off the mortgage in favor of Mrs. Dimafelis, which she was able to rectify approaching Conrado S. David who offered to help thus:ATTY. MABBAYAD, JR.:Q.	Mrs. Camus, are you the same Lea O. Camus who is the plaintiff in this case:A.	Yes, sir.Q.	Do you know the defendant Conrado S.

MABBAYAD:Q.	Mrs. Camus, when Mr. Conrado S. David testified as the first and only witness for the defendants, he said that although initially the transaction you approached (?) to him was one of a loan, eventually and finally it became an outright sale and that you sold the property to him for and in consideration of the price of P150,000.00. What can you say about this testimony of Mr. Conrado David?A.OUR TRANSACTION WITH HIM IS A LOAN FOR THE AMOUNT OF P150,000.00, SIR, WHEN WE APPROACHED HIM, WE REALLY INTENDED TO HAVE A LOAN WITH MORTGAGE AND THEN WHEN I ASKED HIM FOR THE AMOUNT OF P150,000.00 FOR A LOAN, HE SAID WHY IS IT BIG AND ASKED ME HOW MUCH IS THE PRICE PER SQ.METER AND I ANSWERED P500.00.COURT:Q.YOU AGREED TO A SALE?A.I DID NOT AGREE TO A SALE AND OUR AGREEMENT IS ONLY FOR A LOAN WITH MORTGAGE AND HE SAID IF HE IS GOING TO PREPARE A DEED, OF SALE, IT IS ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF FORMALITY, MA'AM.(pp. 2-3, TSN, June 15, 1989; Emphasis supplied.)The foregoing narration was corroborated by petitioner's daughter who declared:ATTY.

P30,000.00, sir.Q.

And what did your mother finally decide?A.	My mother told him that we will first talk about it, sir.Q.	When you used the word ""namin"", to whom in particular was your mother referring?A.	We, sir: my mother, myself and my sister.Q.	You are referring to your other sister Josefina?A.	Yes, sir.Q.	Going back to the rate of interest, when Mr. David told your mother that the rate of interest would be 10% per month, did your mother accept that condition of Mr. David?ATTY. FIDELINO:Already answered, your Honor. The answer is ""We would talk about the matter"".ATTY. MABBAYAD:Referring to the documentation, this is a different matter, your Honor.COURT:Answer.WITNESS:A.	She did not readily agree because she said we would talk about it first, your Honor.ATTY. MABBAYAD:Q.	You would like to tell the Honorable Court that in that second meeting that you and your group had with Mr. David nothing definite yet was arrived at or agreed upon?A.None, sir, because of that deed of sale.Q.	And since there was no meeting of the minds on that particular second meeting, was there another meeting between you and your group and Mr. David?A.	Yes, sir.Q.	When was that?A.	That was about May 19, I am not so sure about the date, sir.Q.	And when you returned, using the word ""you"" in the Plural form, to David, regarding this transaction, were you able to talk to Mr. David, using the word ""you"" to plural form?xxx			xxx			xxxQ.	On that particular third time what did Mr. David and your mother talk about?A.MY MOTHER THEN REQUESTED MR.DAVID IF IT COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT INSTEAD OF A DEED OF SALE A DEED OF REAL ESTATE DOCUMENT WOULD BE EXECUTED BUT HE SAID HE CANNOT DO ANYTHING AND HE ALSO TOLD US NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE AS LONG AS WE CAN PAY THE MONTHLY INTEREST, HE WOULD NOT HAVE THE DEED OF SALE REGISTERED, sir.xxx			xxx			xxxQ.IN SHORT, WHEN MR.DAVID REFUSED TO GRANT THE REQUEST OF YOUR MOTHER WITH RESPECT TO THE MANNER OF DOCUMENTATION OF THE TRANSACTION AND THE RATE OF INTEREST, WHAT HAPPENED?A.MY MOTHER FINALLY AGREED BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY IN NEED OF MONEY, sir.(pp. 14-22, TSN, December 8, 1988; Emphasis supplied.)On the other end of this controversy is private respondent's indifference throughout his comment (p. 81,Rollo) and memorandum as well (p. 200,Rollo)vis-a-visthe clarification made by petitioner herself and petitioner's daughter which unconcerned and nonchalant attitude inevitably leads to the conclusion that petitioner had established heronus probandiby a preponderance of evidence and that private respondent had failed to prove his positive allegations in support of his stance (Section 1, Rule 131, Revised Rules on Evidence). Apart from this procedural axiom is our belief that private respondent's demeanor in retaining a portion of the alleged purchase price, as advance interest for two months, is akin to it has precisely the very circumstance mentioned by Article 1602(4) of the Civil Code that will warrant the legal presumption of an equitable mortgage. Besides, it was erroneous for respondent court to have made a sweeping insinuation that it was petitioner as vendor who suggested the ""purchase price"" and is thus precluded from assailing the sufficiency thereof (p. 66,Rollo), on account of the admissionin judicioof private respondent that it was he who ""placed the value of P150,000.00"" as consideration on the document (p. 33,Rollo; TSN, April 6, 1989, pp. 8-11). The fact that petitioner was accompanied by her ""businesswoman daughter"" to the office of private respondent is of no practical bearing because even persons of average intelligence invariably find themselves in no position whatsoever when bargaining with their creditor (Cabigao vs. Sales, et al., (C.A.) 51 O. G. 5265; 5 Tolentino, Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code 1959 edition, p. 137) such as private respondents corporation whose primary business concern includes giving loans (TSN, March 30, 1989, pp. 8-10; p. 32,Rollo). Moreover, it may be recalled that petitioner only received the sum of P1,000.00 out of the P150,000.00 alleged as consideration for the ""sale"" (p. 18,supra). Such a measly sum is certainly another circumstance that reinforces our belief that the entire transaction was but a loan accommodation since no seller in her right senses will part with her treasured possessionviaa tedious process only to end up with a small sum of money in her pocket as certification therefor.At any rate substantive law mandates that a contract forfeited to beventa con facto de retroor an outright to be construed as an equitable mortgage for it involves a smaller transmission of rights (Olino vs. Molina, 13 Phil. 379 (1909); Villa vs. Santiago, 38 Phil. 157 (1918); 5 Tolentino,supra, at p. 15). Moreover, there is no doubt that petitioner agreed to the execution of the so-called sale in favor of private respondent because of the urgent necessity for money of the apparent vendor to liquidate her indebtedness to Mrs. Dimafelis (Claravall vs. Court of Appeals, 190 SCRA 439 (1990); Labasan vs. Lacuesta, 86 SCRA 16 (1978). This is another circumstance where it may be fairly inferred that the real intention of the parties is for the transaction to secure the payment of a debt or the performance of any other obligation (Article 1602 (6), New Civil Code).WHEREFORE, the decision of respondent court dated October 10, 1991 is hereby SET ASIDE. The deed of absolute sale executed by Lea O. Camus in favor of Conrado S. David is hereby declared as an equitable mortgage and, petitioner is declared entitled to redeem the property. Private respondent is hereby ordered to execute the necessary deed of conveyance upon full payment of the total amount of P110,000.00 with legal interest from May 20, 1986, the time the loan matured until it is fully satisfied.SO ORDERED.Feliciano, Bidin, Davide, Jr. and Romero, JJ., concur.The Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation","Republic of the Philippines

THIRD DIVISION


G.R. No. 102314	May 26, 1993


LEA O. CAMUS, petitioner,

vs.


THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, CONRADO S. DAVID and DAVID MOTORS and MARKETING CORPORATION, respondents.


Juan E. Mabbayad, Jr. for petitioner.


Antonio B. Fidelito for private respondents.




MELO,J.:
Both the trial and appellate courts construed the transaction effected between herein petitioner and private respondent on May 20, 1986 as an absolute sale of a piece of realty, but petitioner thinks otherwise, saying that it was a mere equitable mortgage. Hence, the petition at bar.


Respondent court briefly narrated the background of the case which petitioner did not bother to assail in her pleadings before this Court, thus:






On May 20, 1986, the parties, with plaintiff-appellant as vendor and defendant-appellee David Motors and Marketing Corporation (DMMC, for brevity) through its representative, defendant-appellee David, executed by and between themselves a ""Deed of Absolute Sale of Real Property"" over a parcel of land (Lot 7-B of the Subd. plan (LRC) psd-324403, approved as a non-subd. proj. being a portion of Lot 7 (LRC) Pcs-16468 LRC Rec. No. 5941), including all improvements thereon, situated in the barrio of  Hen. T. de Leon, Municipality of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, containing an area of Six Hundred Thirty One (631) square meters, more or less, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 119038 of the Registry of Deeds of Caloocan City, and for and in consideration of One Hundred Fifty Thousand (P150,000.00) Pesos (Exhibit ""B"" also Exhibit ""2"").


On November 27, 1987, plaintiff-appellant filed the instant complaint, praying for the annulment of the subject deed of absolute sale and consequent cancellation of the certificate of title obtained by defendants-appellees by virtue thereof; the interpretation and declaration of the subject deed of absolute sale as an equitable mortgage; and for a writ of preliminary injunction (Record, pp. 1-38).


In their answer, defendants-appellees, contended that the subject encumbrance was one of absolute sale (Record, pp. 51-70).


After trial on the merits, the lower court rendered the impugned decision . . . (p. 62, 
Rollo
.)






In her memorandum, petitioner hastened to add a few more details on how the so-called sale in favor of private respondent evolved. According to petitioner, she previously mortgaged the same parcel of land on July 23, 1985 to Mrs. Macaria Dimafelis. Before the mortgage matured, she had to look for other sources from whom she can borrow money to liquidate the mortgage and this financial constraint led to her being introduced to Conrado S. David, herein private respondent, through one Natividad de Gula. It was in the office of private respondent where petitioner impressed that idea of utilizing the mortgaged lot as collateral for the loan which she wanted to obtain from private respondent.


In response to the request, private respondent allegedly agreed to extend the loan subject to the following terms:


a)	the gross principal amount of the indebtedness shall be P150,000.00;


b)	repayment period will be two years with an automatic grace period of one month;


c)	interest shall ten percent a month payable monthly;


d)	the transaction shall be denominated as an absolute sale instead of a real estate mortgage; and that


e)	out of the proceeds of the loan, P40,000.00 will be retained by private respondent as payment for a two months advance interest (P30,000.00 at P15,000.00 interest a month) and the remaining sum of P10,000.00 will be for documentation expense.


Petitioner claims that she was initially reluctant to express her conformity but she nonetheless agreed to the conditions after she was supposedly assured by private respondent that the nomenclature attached to their transaction was a mere formality and that petitioner had no reason to be apprehensive inasmuch as private respondent will register the deed of conveyance only if petitioner does not pay the monthly interest. Petitioner signed the ""Deed of Absolute Sale"" and surrendered the owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title after private respondent issued a check in the amount of P109,000.00 to Mrs. Dimafelis as full settlement of petitioner's previous indebtedness. For her part, petitioner received P1,000.00 in cash and was made to sign a cash voucher to show that she received P150,000.00. Further, payment of the interest for four months was allegedly made to private respondent, who did not issue any receipt therefor, until petitioner discovered, to her dismay, that the instrument was registered which triggered the issuance of a new certificate of title in the name of respondent corporation. 


All of the foregoing statements were derived by petitioner from her open court declarations when she sat on the witness stand in order to develop the theory that the entire scheme was a simple loan accommodation.


But the trial court was far from convinced by petitioner's disquisition and neither was respondent court which concurred with the factual observation of the court of origin that gross inadequacy of price had not been sufficiently demonstrated. In interpreting the covenant as an absolute transmission of dominion in favor of private respondent, Justices Aldecoa, Jr., Campos, and Felimon Mendoza were in unison when they declared that none of the badges of an equitable mortgage under Article 1602 of the Civil Code can be appreciated ""in favor of herein petitioner (p. 68, 
Rollo
).


Of particular significance to the resolution of the question on the true character of the disputed transaction are the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the contracting parties which have been translated into testimonial evidence in the course of the trial on the merits. Indeed, this specie of evidentiary proof, known as the Parol Evidence Rule, may well be the acknowledged adjective norm that can spell the difference between successor failure of the instant petition (Macapinlac vs. Gutierrez Repide, 43 Phil. 770 [1922]: Cuyugan vs. Santos, 34 Phil. 100 [1916]). For there can be a better appreciation of the problem at hand only if we resort to what the parties had already emphasized below to buttress their respective contentions and in this respect, the decision of respondent court seems a bit deficient considering that it relied more on the alleged sufficiency of the purchase price (p. 66, 
Rollo
) and the bare fact that petitioner, who was accompanied by her ""businesswoman daughter"", could not have been duped into accepting private respondent's offer to purchase the property (p. 67, 
Rollo
).


We concede that on these two aspects, we do not occupy a superior position to brush aside what respondent court, arrived at but the so-called adequacy of the consideration, pegged at P150,000.00 by private respondent himself (p. 33, 
Rollo
) for a 631 square meter lot, and the impression of petitioner's willingness to absolutely part with her possession, do not necessarily diminish the existence of other circumstances under Article 1602 of the Civil Code.


Verily, petitioner endeavored to demonstrate her financial constraint and the need to pay off the mortgage in favor of Mrs. Dimafelis, which she was able to rectify approaching Conrado S. David who offered to help thus:

ATTY. MABBAYAD:

NO MORE, sir

(pp. 3-5, 7-10, 12, TSN, April 7, 1989; Emphasis supplied.)










To the question of whether petitioner agreed to an outright sale, she emphasized a vehement denial on June 15, 1989:










ATTY. MABBAYAD:


Q.	Mrs. Camus, when Mr. Conrado S. David testified as the first and only witness for the defendants, he said that although initially the transaction you approached (?) to him was one of a loan, eventually and finally it became an outright sale and that you sold the property to him for and in consideration of the price of P150,000.00. What can you say about this testimony of Mr. Conrado David?


A.	
OUR TRANSACTION WITH HIM IS A LOAN FOR THE AMOUNT OF P150,000
.
00, SIR, WHEN WE APPROACHED HIM, WE REALLY INTENDED TO HAVE A LOAN WITH MORTGAGE AND THEN WHEN I ASKED HIM FOR THE AMOUNT OF P150,000
.
00 FOR A LOAN, HE SAID WHY IS IT BIG AND ASKED ME HOW MUCH IS THE PRICE PER SQ
.
 METER AND I ANSWERED P500
.
00
.


COURT:


Q.	
YOU AGREED TO A SALE?


A.	
I DID NOT AGREE TO A SALE AND OUR AGREEMENT IS ONLY FOR A LOAN WITH MORTGAGE AND HE SAID IF HE IS GOING TO PREPARE A DEED, OF SALE, IT IS ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF FORMALITY, MA'AM
.


(pp. 2-3, TSN, June 15, 1989; Emphasis supplied.)










The foregoing narration was corroborated by petitioner's daughter who declared:

A.	
He said he is AMENABLE IN GRANTING THE P150,000

00 LOAN TO MY MOTHER BUT MY MOTHER WILL ONLY GET P110,000
.
00 BECAUSE THE REST WILL BE FOR THE DOCUMENTATIONS AND FOR THE ADVANCE INTEREST

 David tell your mother how much is for documentation? 


A.	
P10,000
.
00

 sir

A.	P30,000.00, sir.


Q.	How much interest was finally agreed upon between Mr. David and your mother?


A.	10% per month, sir.


Q.	
And aside from the amount of the loan and the rate of interest agreed upon by your mother and Mr
.
 David, were there other terms and conditions imposed on by Mr
.
 David?


COURT:


	Is there no written agreement?


ATTY. MABBAYAD:

ATTY. MABBAYAD:


Q.	What about other terms of payment or period of payment of the loan that was agreed upon between him and your mother?


A.	
To be paid in 2 years, sir
.


Q.	
WHEN MR
.
 DAVID TOLD YOUR MOTHER THAT THE TRANSACTION WOULD BE DOCUMENTED AS A DEED OF SALE NOT AN ORDINARY COLLATERALIZED DOCUMENT AS A DEED OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE, WHAT, DID YOUR MOTHER TELL HIM?


A.	
MY MOTHER TOLD HIM THAT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT INSTEAD OF A DEED OF SALE A DEED OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE WOULD BE EXECUTED BECAUSE IF THE DOCUMENT WOULD BE A DEED OF SALE, IT IS DANGEROUS
.


Q.	
AND WHAT DID MR
.
 DAVID REPLY TO YOUR MOTHER?


A.	
HE SAID THAT THAT IS HIS POLICY
.


Q.	And what did your mother finally decide?


A.	My mother told him that we will first talk about it, sir.

A.	We, sir: my mother, myself and my sister.


Q.	You are referring to your other sister Josefina?


A.	Yes, sir.


Q.	Going back to the rate of interest, when Mr. David told your mother that the rate of interest would be 10% per month, did your mother accept that condition of Mr. David?


ATTY. FIDELINO:


	Already answered, your Honor. The answer is ""We would talk about the matter"".


ATTY. MABBAYAD:


	Referring to the documentation, this is a different matter, your Honor.


COURT:


	Answer.


WITNESS:


A.	She did not readily agree because she said we would talk about it first, your Honor.


ATTY. MABBAYAD:


Q.	You would like to tell the Honorable Court that in that second meeting that you and your group had with Mr. David nothing definite yet was arrived at or agreed upon?


A.	
None, sir, because of that deed of sale
.


Q.	And since there was no meeting of the minds on that particular second meeting, was there another meeting between you and your group and Mr. David?


A.	Yes, sir.


Q.	When was that?


A.	That was about May 19, I am not so sure about the date, sir.


Q.	And when you returned, using the word ""you"" in the Plural form, to David, regarding this transaction, were you able to talk to Mr. David, using the word ""you"" to plural form?


xxx			xxx			xxx


Q.	On that particular third time what did Mr. David and your mother talk about?


A.	
MY MOTHER THEN REQUESTED MR
.
 DAVID IF IT COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT INSTEAD OF A DEED OF SALE A DEED OF REAL ESTATE DOCUMENT WOULD BE EXECUTED BUT HE SAID HE CANNOT DO ANYTHING AND HE ALSO TOLD US NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE AS LONG AS WE CAN PAY THE MONTHLY INTEREST, HE WOULD NOT HAVE THE DEED OF SALE REGISTERED, sir
.

Q.	
IN SHORT, WHEN MR
.
 DAVID REFUSED TO GRANT THE REQUEST OF YOUR MOTHER WITH RESPECT TO THE MANNER OF DOCUMENTATION OF THE TRANSACTION AND THE RATE OF INTEREST, WHAT HAPPENED?


A.	
MY MOTHER FINALLY AGREED BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY IN NEED OF MONEY, sir
.


(pp. 14-22, TSN, December 8, 1988; Emphasis supplied.)










On the other end of this controversy is private respondent's indifference throughout his comment (p. 81, 
Rollo
) and memorandum as well (p. 200, 
Rollo
) 
vis-a-vis 
the clarification made by petitioner herself and petitioner's daughter which unconcerned and nonchalant attitude inevitably leads to the conclusion that petitioner had established her 
onus probandi
 by a preponderance of evidence and that private respondent had failed to prove his positive allegations in support of his stance (
Section 1
, Rule 131, Revised Rules on Evidence). Apart from this procedural axiom is our belief that private respondent's demeanor in retaining a portion of the alleged purchase price, as advance interest for two months, is akin to it has precisely the very circumstance mentioned by Article 1602(4) of the Civil Code that will warrant the legal presumption of an equitable mortgage. Besides, it was erroneous for respondent court to have made a sweeping insinuation that it was petitioner as vendor who suggested the ""purchase price"" and is thus precluded from assailing the sufficiency thereof (p. 66, 
Rollo
), on account of the admission 
in judicio 
of private respondent that it was he who ""placed the value of P150,000.00"" as consideration on the document (p. 33, 
Rollo
; TSN, April 6, 1989, pp. 8-11). The fact that petitioner was accompanied by her ""businesswoman daughter"" to the office of private respondent is of no practical bearing because even persons of average intelligence invariably find themselves in no position whatsoever when bargaining with their creditor (Cabigao vs. Sales, et al., (C.A.) 51 O. G. 5265; 5 Tolentino, Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code 1959 edition, p. 137) such as private respondents corporation whose primary business concern includes giving loans (TSN, March 30, 1989, pp. 8-10; p. 32, 
Rollo
). Moreover, it may be recalled that petitioner only received the sum of P1,000.00 out of the P150,000.00 alleged as consideration for the ""sale"" (p. 18, 
supra
). Such a measly sum is certainly another circumstance that reinforces our belief that the entire transaction was but a loan accommodation since no seller in her right senses will part with her treasured possession 
via 
a tedious process only to end up with a small sum of money in her pocket as certification therefor.


At any rate substantive law mandates that a contract forfeited to be 
venta con facto de retro 
or an outright to be construed as an equitable mortgage for it involves a smaller transmission of rights (Olino vs. Molina, 13 Phil. 379 (1909); Villa vs. Santiago, 38 Phil. 157 (1918); 5 Tolentino, 
supra
, at p. 15). Moreover, there is no doubt that petitioner agreed to the execution of the so-called sale in favor of private respondent because of the urgent necessity for money of the apparent vendor to liquidate her indebtedness to Mrs. Dimafelis (Claravall vs. Court of Appeals, 190 SCRA 439 (1990); Labasan vs. Lacuesta, 86 SCRA 16 (1978). This is another circumstance where it may be fairly inferred that the real intention of the parties is for the transaction to secure the payment of a debt or the performance of any other obligation (
Article 1602 (6)
, New Civil Code).


WHEREFORE, the decision of respondent court dated October 10, 1991 is hereby SET ASIDE. The deed of absolute sale executed by Lea O. Camus in favor of Conrado S. David is hereby declared as an equitable mortgage and, petitioner is declared entitled to redeem the property. Private respondent is hereby ordered to execute the necessary deed of conveyance upon full payment of the total amount of P110,000.00 with legal interest from May 20, 1986, the time the loan matured until it is fully satisfied.


SO ORDERED.
