Santos, the eldest, has executed a deed of transfer reconveying 75% of the property known as the Sto. Niño property and has further agreed to pay reasonable premiums to be discussed on the balance of the purchase price to the unpaid co-owners of the property known as the Malvar property to include Marino G. Santos for the improvements he introduced therein; and that the parties have agreed to the mutual withdrawal of all pending actions and proceedings initiated by the respective parties against the other. They pray for the dismissal of the following cases:

all the name of Briccio G. Santos. These TCTs are the subject of the complaint in Civil Case No. 24,622-96 which case is now before this Court by virtue of a petition for review on 
certiorari
.




The parties likewise pray that in Civil Case No. 25,488-97, the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 8 order the removal of the notice of 
lis pendens
 annotated in TCT No. 257728 in the name of Briccio G. Santos.


What is before this Court is the petition for review on 
certiorari
 (docketed as G.R. No. 131750) from the order of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 14 which dismissed Civil Case No. 24,622-96 for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the parties of the case are stockholders of the same corporation and the issues to be resolved were within the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
2
 However, the two (2) civil cases aforementioned (nos. 25,448-97 and 26,180-98) are still pending before the Regional Trial Courts over which this Court cannot assume jurisdiction by the mere expedient of filing the instant motion to dismiss.


Considering that the joint motion to dismiss the present case was signed by the parties herein and assisted by their respective counsels and that it is not contrary to law, public policy, or good morals, the Court RESOLVES to PARTIALLY GRANT the same. Accordingly, the instant case, G.R. No. 131570, is DISMISSED.


However, as regards Civil Cases Nos. 25,448-97 and 26,180-98, the joint motion to dismiss should properly be addressed to the trial courts where the said cases are pending.
