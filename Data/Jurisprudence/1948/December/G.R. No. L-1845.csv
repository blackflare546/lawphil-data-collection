The witness heard it twice. All the accused were armed with .45 caliber revolvers. (34). The deceased, the witness and the accused left at 2:30 p.m. on December 3. The deceased was carrying money, a ring and a watch. (35). The bride and the bridegroom also left. All went to the shore, including Galicano Abanico and the accused and many others. (36).

When the witness, Elpidio and Galicano Abanico arrived at a place of barrio Subic, eight persons overtook them. Guillermo Atienza who was ahead aiming his revolver at the trio said: ""Do not go ahead, otherwise you will die."" At that moment Elpidio was surrounded by Tomas Caraos, Antonio Daño, Pedro Arriola, Florencio Bihis, Martin Maranan, and Dominador Cagitla. (38). The witness ran because he heard a shot. At a distance of about 30 meters he turned his face and he saw that the malefactors were searching the garments of Elpidio. In all, three shot were fired. The first one was fired by Pascual Bihis.

But Maximo was not brought because he was killed in Kiling, Talisay. (972).


16.	Luis Atienza 57, married, attorney-at-law, 389 Dapitan, Manila. — ""Before appearing as counsel for the defense in this case, Gaudencio Bihis who is my relative went to me requesting me to help him in preparing the necessary documents for settling amicably the case between his brother Florencio Bihis, accused, Pascual Bihis and others also accused in this present case on The one hand, and on the other part, the relative of the deceased Elpidio Promentilla. I told Gaudencio Bihis that no settlement could be made judicially n any criminal case because the government is the aggrieved party and the accused are the ones opposed to the government interest. Gaudencio Bihis requested me to accompany him to Taal. When he saw in Taal, Sotero, Promentilla, he asked him if he wanted the case to be amicably settled and Sotero replied in the affirmative. Sotero Bihis protested against being compelled to pay a single centavo. Gaudencio said that if it is a matter of P1,000 his uncle can make some effort. Severino said that if his son is guilty, he would be willing to give not only P1,500 but even P10,000 by selling or mortgaging his property. He was willing to give a contribution of P100. Nothing clear was done. The next day, the witness said that it was possible for him to convince his uncle to give P1,000, but Sotero said that as these people are now in jail his father was asking P2,000. (989-995).


After a careful thorough analysis of the testimonies of all the witnesses both for the prosecution and for the defense, the conclusion is inevitable that it has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that on December 1, 1945, Elpidio Promentilla or Promentilla left his home with P4,000, as capital to buy horses, and another amount for expenses. He carried with him a watch and a ring valued respectively at P60 and P150. On December 3, 1945, he attended a wedding party in barrio Binibiloan, Lemery. All the accused also attended it, where they had been drinking. All of the time, accused Pascual Bihis told his companions that he would shoot them if they did not obey him. In the afternoon the party broke out. The people went to the shore to take boats to their respective destinations. Because they were not able to get a banca, Elpidio and his companions, Antonio Vitas and Galicano Abanico, started home by walking, but not without taking of first their pants to avoid being wet, as they had to pass through water. In undressing to remain in drawers and undershirt, Elpidio took his roll of money and rolled it i the folds of his pants. He did it in the presence of the crowd gathered in the place, among them the accused. When the deceased and his companions arrived at a place at barrio Subic, eight persons, including Guillermo Atienza and the six appellants, overtook them and killed Elpidio. When the latter's companions returned to the scene with the assistant barrio lieutenant, they denounced the killing and no money was found. The watch and ring of Elpidio also disappeared. The appellants had been seen by Elpidio's companions searching the body of Elpidio immediately after killing him by shooting.
lawphil.net


Appellants do not dispute the robbery and the killing of Elpidio. They even proved by their witnesses that, as a matter of fact, Elpidio was killed in barrio Subic on December 3, 1945. They also gathered that Guillermo Atienza was one of the killers. They contend, however, that they took no part in the killing, because at the time three of them were sitting in a damaged and half-wrecked 
banca
, covered with water up to their waist, while the remaining others went walking in another way to their homes, and that the killing was effected by only by two persons, Guillermo Atienza and an unknown and unidentified person.


The evidence offered by the defense appears to be unconvincing and has not detracted any force from the unbiased, positive, and forthright testimonies of Vitas and Abanico, who had actually witnessed the perpetration of the crime. The fact that the witnesses for the defense joined Guillermo Atienza with an unknown persons as one of the killers of the deceased has not much weight considering that Guillermo Atienza is already dead, and to point him as one of the killers may give some color of veracity of said witnesses' declarations that they had also seen the killing.


Aside from the many contradictions among the witnesses for the defense, the theory of the prosecution appears to be corroborated by the admissions made by Pedro Arriola the next day after that of the crime when he was investigated, and by some incidents at the wedding party. While some witnesses for the defense said that the accused did not drink wine at the wedding party, others said that they did. While some denied that Pascual Bihis uttered any did. While some denied that Pascual Bihis uttered any menacing words against those who would not obey him, others said that he did.


Appellants tried to convey the idea that Guillermo Atienza killed Elpidio as a reprisal because of a conflict between them in the buying of a horse. But according to the same appellants, the difference was amicably patched up, as Elpidio allowed Guillermo Atienza to have the horse and the settlement took place hours before the killing.


Appellants are guilty of robbery with homicide.


The trial court sentenced them to reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the heirs of the offended party in the sum of P2,000 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, to return to said heirs P4,000, the ring worth P160 and the watch valued P60, or in the default to pay them the amount of P4,220, also without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs of the proceedings.


The Solicitor General recommends that the amount of P4,220 be reduced to P4,210 and that the indemnity of P4,000 be increased to P6,000 in consonance with the doctrine laid down in
 People vs. Amansec 
(L-927, March 11, 1948, 45 Off Gaz. [Supp. to No. 9], 51)
 1 
.


The recommendations are well taken. The appealed decision is affirmed, modified as recommended, with costs against appellants.


Moran, C. J. Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, Tuason, and Montemayor, JJ., concur.
