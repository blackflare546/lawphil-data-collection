vs.


COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, BATO MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS, CAMARINES SUR, and OSMUNDO POSUGAC,
 respondents.


Vicente de Vera, Chairman, for the Commission of Elections.

Geronimo Paredes for respondent Posugac.


PARAS, 
J.
:


On November 16, 1947, the respondent Osmundo Posugac was proclaimed mayor-elect of the municipality of Bato, Camarines Sur, by the municipal board of canvassers. The next day the local representative of the Nationalista Party addressed a complaint to the Commission on Elections requesting an investigation and the annulment of the canvass made by the said board of canvassers, on the ground that the latter, instead of counting the genuine election return from precinct No. 10, included in the canvass a falsified return. On December 12, 1947, the Commission on Elections resolved to abstain from proceeding with the investigation in view of the pendency of an election protest filed in the meantime by the petitioner Mateo Ramos in the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, seeking to nullify the election of respondent Osmundo Posugac. Failing to obtain a reconsideration of the action of the Commission on Elections, the petitioner has brought the present original action for 
mandamus
, praying for the reversal of the ruling of the Commission on Elections, for an order directing the municipal board of canvassers of Bato to make a new canvass and to include therein the genuine election return from precinct No. 10, and for the consequent proclamation of the petitioner as mayor-elect of the municipality of Bato, Camarines Sur.


We are of course not called upon in these proceedings to determine whether the municipal board of canvassers of Bato in fact counted a falsified return from Precinct No. 10, since the only question that properly presents itself is whether the respondent Commission on Elections had unlawfully neglected to perform an act specifically enjoined as duty or, stated otherwise, whether the duty of the respondent Commission to investigate and act on a matter such as that denounced to it by the petitioner or his representative, is ministerial (in which case 
mandamus
 lies) or discretionary (in which case 
mandamus
 does not lie).


In our opinion, the duty involved is discretionary. It is true that this Court, in the case of 
Mintu et al. vs. Enage et al
., G.R. No. L-1834, held that the Commission on Elections did not act in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in annulling the canvass made by the municipal board of canvassers of Tanza, Cavite, of the votes cast in only some of the eighteen precints; but this does not necessarily amount to a pronouncement that its function regarding the propriety or legality of a canvass of election returns is ministerial. At any rate, the aforesaid case is distinguishable from the case at bar, inasmuch as in the first case, the board of canvassers of Tanza, merely failed or refused to include in the canvass the election returns from some of the precints, while in the second the board of canvassers of Bato already counted one of two contradictory election returns from Precinct No. 10 and the Commission on Elections was called upon to receive evidence before it could determine which of said two returns was genuine.


Upon the other hand, there is every indication that the Commission on Elections is clothed with a discretion in the matter. Before the proclamation of election, any candidate may petition the Court of First Instance to recount the votes cast in any precinct in case of discrepancies between copies of statements of election (secs. 163 and 168, Revised Election Code). After the proclamation, any candidate may file an election protest within two weeks (sec. 174 
Id
.). These specific legal provisions logically compel any candidate, within short time limits, to seek in the Court of First Instance the corresponding relief against the regularity of a canvass of election, and to the same extent relieve the Commission on Elections from the duty of conducting similar investigations. To contend that the Commission on Elections has the ministerial function, and therefore may be compelled by 
mandamus
, to look into and act on all election frauds, is indirectly to incapacitate it; for with its limited personnel and facilities, the Commission on Elections cannot be expected to take cognizance and promptly dispose of every complaint, similar to that made by the petitioner, possibly to originate from countless municipalities in the Philippines.


If the charges alleged by the petitioner are true, we have no doubt that the Court of First Instance will be as able as the Commission on Elections, or any competent authority for that matter, to see the point; and it is needless to say that there is enough in our laws under which the culprits may be prosecuted and punished.


As the vote of the Court both during the first deliberation and after a rehearing is five to five, pursuant to Rule of Court No. 56, section 2, the petition is hereby denied and the writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued dissolved, with costs against the petitioner. So ordered.

Separate Opinions


TUASON, 
J., 
concurring:


I concur in the result of the resolution.


I cannot share in the opinion that the Commission on Elections has discretionary power to annul a canvass by the board of canvassers. If it had such power I would be inclined to agree that a grave abuse of discretion was committed when the Commission denied or declined to act on the petition of the local representatives of the Nacionalista Party, in the face of its (Commission's ) finding that the returns used in the canvass were forged. In my opinion the Commission had no other alternative but to refrain, as it did, from taking cognizance of the complaint. A machinery of justice with special, summary jurisdiction and clearly outlined procedure has been set up to hear and decide precisely such irregularities as are charged in the case at bar. The Commission on Elections is an administrative body endowed with administrative functions only. Determination of which of two or more conflicting returns is authentic is a judicial prerogative. It requires the taking of evidence, the holding of a regular trial, if justice is to be done to both parties. It amounts to a power to declare, in some cases as in this, that one candidate has been elected over another candidate or other candidates.


In other words, the Commission on Elections has both the power and the duty to correct any error committed by election officials in ministerial and administrative matter which do not call for the exercise of judgment. The case of 
Mintu et al. vs. Enage et al
., G.R. No. L-1834, comes under this category. There the board of canvassers failed to perform an administrative duty by omitting to count the votes in some of the returns. To count all the returns instead of some is an administrative function which the Commission had the authority and the duty to have performed; just as it is its authority and duty to compel the board of canvassers to act when the latter refuses absolutely to make any canvass.


As I have said, the subject-matter of the present petition is one which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance. If ballot boxes have been destroyed together with their contents, that is no ground for taking the case out of the method of procedure provided by law. The counting of ballots is not only the modes by which the protestants can established his right to be declared elected into an office.


The same goes with the objection that a regular election contest takes up much time. Possible delays or indubitableness of the frauds is never a justification for extraordinary measure. Wrongs, no matter how brazen and flagrant do not countenance the use of arbitrary, extra legal remedy to replace the recognized processes of law, no matter how slow these may be. Let that happen once, and it will become an established practice which may give it us cause for regret when, in the change of circumstances, the case becomes our own. The rights guaranteed by the Constitution can only be safeguarded through observance of legally established rules.

PERFECTO, 
J., 
dissenting:


The election fraud, bared in this case with all its repugnant shamelessness, has no parallel in the annals of our half a century of democratic government. Perpetrated, not by lawless dissidents or ignorant private citizens, not by bandits or anarchists, nor by highway robbers or supermodern gangsters, but by officers of government who have sworn to obey the law and the Constitution, who have been appointed to administer the law for the purpose of ensuing free, orderly, and honest elections, and upon whom the whole world looks as defenders of the popular sovereignty, as guardians to protect the electorate from being cheated, as the official guarantors so that the will of the people may not be defeated. They were and are the trusted guardians of the purity of suffrage, but instead of keeping her untarnished in the ivory tower of the law, turned into beastly rapers to ravish her with impunity in the quagmire of partisan unscrupulousness.


The ravished beauty shouted in vain for help. Her clamors resounded to the high heavens. In the desolation of her tragedy, she directed her tearful eyes to the Commission on Elections, the sturdy fortress where the Constitution has placed powerful officers to direct, supervise, control and command, the national army of guards entrusted with the function of insuring the safety and the purity of suffrage. Although convinced of the actuality of the attack, described as ""brutal"" by its own counsel, Atty. Perez, inconsistent with the legal principle it enunciated and followed in several other cases, the commission hesitated to lift a finger to come to the rescue. Not yielding completely to the creeping advances of exasperating despair, the victim, still holding in her wounded heart, the last ambers of hope, in a supreme effort, addressed herself to the Supreme Court, but the thick walls of this last bulwark of democracy were as deaf as the black and mossy stones of a deserted castle, standing as mute as death in an inaccessible cliff surrounded by an ocean of silence.


A deep feeling of humiliation overcomes us upon fulfilling our constitutional duty of writing this opinion. There is no task more painful to perform than to confess a failure of the tribunal in which we have the honor of sitting as a member. That failure is a failure of justice. With that failure, democracy is immolated in the altar of a new Mammon, where the lust for power is made a religion to justify and sanctify all kinds of means, whether tainted with fraud or parading the insolence of despicable perversity. The reality is repugnantly ugly, but loyalty to truth compels us to face and bear it with manliness. No matter how much it may hurt our pride, we have to admit that in this case the action of the Supreme Court could hardly be defended.


Divided five to five, this Court's failure to reach a majority decision after about three months, will result in the accomplishment of a wanton electoral fraud, one of the most shameless and scandalous ever officially recorded. With our deadlock, we will allow the consummation of one of the most insolent conspiracies to defeat the will of the people and to impose upon them the rule of a usurper, the very man who has been conclusively repudiated by a majority of the electorate. By our failure to administer justice, we will allow the conspirators to profit by the falsification of a public document, the criminal scheme by which they intended to cheat of his election the candidate chosen by suffrage of the people.


Two candidates ran for mayor of Bato, Camarines Sur in the elections of November 11, 1947; Mateo Ramos, Nacionalista, and Osmundo Posugac, Liberal. The former was elected with a majority of 48 votes, both candidates receiving the following votes.








Ramos




1,033






Posugac




985








The above results were published by the municipal treasurer by recording the votes received by each candidate in the twelve precints of Bato in a public blackboard in the municipal building.


On November 16, 1947, the municipal board of canvassers presided by Mayor Eulogio Buquid, by using a falsified copy of the election returns of Precinct No. 10, in which 60 votes actually received by defeated Posugac was increased to 133, with the addition of false and imaginary 73 votes, instead of proclaiming the election of winning candidate Ramos, proclaimed Posugac, by falsely adjudicating to him 1,058 votes instead of the 985 he actually received, giving him a false majority of 23 votes over Ramos.


The criminal alteration made in the election returns was made at the instigation of Mayor Eulogio Buquid, Liberal, that is, of the same political party as Posugac. Cognizant of the true results of the election, in which Posugac appears to have been defeated, one day after the election, or on November 12, 1947, Mayor Buquid sent a letter to the president of the board of inspectors of Precinct No. 10 so as to make Posugac lead by at least 50 or 60 votes, to overcome Ramos' majority of 36 votes in the 11 remaining precints of Bato. The letter was written in plain Bicol, a dialect known to the writer of this opinion since his childhood. A photostatic copy of the letter is filed in the records of this case as Exhibit 4 and has been published in the Free Press, a weekly of wide circulation.


Our own translation of the letter is as follows:








Bato, Nov, 12, 1947






Dear Mion:


Upon the result of the eleven precints, ""Pading"" Osmundo appears to have lost by 36 votes, excluding Pagatpatan, your precinct. Hence, if he has lost there, you do all the means to amend the election returns so the ""Pading"" Osmundo may have there a majority of around 50 to 60 votes.


I pin my hope that you will be able to help, inasmuch as this is the wish of the two lawyers accompanying Governor Gallego this morning. If we have won, according to what is said, we have a majority of 100 votes for the mayoralty, but we do not believe it.






Yours for victory

E. BUQUID"
