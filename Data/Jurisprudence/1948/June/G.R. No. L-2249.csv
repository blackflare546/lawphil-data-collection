TUASON, 
J.
:


Prudencio Surallo is confined in the New Bilibid Prisons in Muntinlupa, Rizal by virtue of a decision dated September 23,1943 of a general court martial convened on or about August, 1943, by Coronel R.V. Bowler, Commanding Officer of the 10th Military District, whereby Surallo was sentenced to life imprisonment for alleged violation of the 93rd Article of War  of the Philippine Army. It is alleged as grounds of this petition that the district commander  who appointed that court martial had no authority to do so.


In his return in behalf of the respondent Director of Prisons, the Solicitor General  accepts the correctness of the petitioner's allegations and consents to the granting of the petition.


The writ is granted and the prisoner, Prudencio Surallo, is ordered released from confinement.
