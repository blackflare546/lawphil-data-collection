RE S O L U T I O N 


REYES, J.B.L., 
Actg. C.J.:


          This petition for the review of the decision of the Court of Appeals in its case CA-G.R. No. 24228-R was docketed as case G.R. No. L-22667 in this Supreme Court on April 8, 1964.


          By Resolution of May 6, 1964, the Court ordered that the Petition be given due course.


          Thereafter, in conformity with section 3 of Revised Rule 56, on June 15, 1964, the Clerk of this Court notified and required the counsel for petitioners, by registered mail, to file his printed brief within thirty (30) days.


          Despite notice from the Postmaster sent on July 1, 1964, the attorney for the appellant did not collect nor claim the notice of the Clerk of Court. The notice, therefore, became effective five (5) days thereafter, on July 6, 1964 and the period to file the brief on August 5, 1964. No brief was filed nor did petitioners ask for any extension. The respondents were then required on August 24, 1964 to file their brief; but they also failed to do so, despite receipt of the requirement on August 25, 1964.


          Since the last mentioned date, no pleadings or motions have been filed by either party. Lack of interest is most evident.
