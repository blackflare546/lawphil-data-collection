BENGZON., J.P., 
J.:


          Five hundred packages of 6-ply paper bags salt P.D.V. were shipped from England, consigned to Wise and Company, Inc. in Manila and discharged by the carrier SS ""Antilochus"" into the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service. Of the shipment, the Customs Arrastre Service delivered only 438 bags of which 31 bags were torn and slack. The consignee claimed P549.30 — the value of the 62 bags undelivered and the damage to the aforementioned 31 bags. When the Customs Arrastre Service failed to pay, the consignee, on February 16, 1965, filed before the City Court of Manila an action to recover said amount plus P150 attorney's fees, from the Republic of the Philippines, the Bureau of Customs and the Customs Arrastre Service.


          The City Court and, on appeal, even the Court of Instance of Manila ordered the defendants to pay plaintiff P549.39 notwithstanding the former's refusal to admit liability and its allegations of non-suability and non-compliance with the requisites for money claims against the government under Act No. 3083 as amended by C.A. 327. Hence, this appeal.


          Plaintiff-appellee, after filing a motion to dismiss herein, submitted the case ""for decision"" without appellee's brief, in view of Our ruling in the case of 
Mobil Philippines Exploration v. Customs Arrastre Service and Bureau of Customs
, L-23139, December 17, 1966. There and in subsequent cases, 
1 
We held that aside from having to present money claims of this nature according to the procedure set in Act 3083 as amended by C.A. 327, the Republic of the Philippines, the Bureau of Customs and the Customs Arrastre Service — agencies of the former — operated the arrastre service as a mere incident of a proper governmental function — that of assessing and collecting lawful revenues from imported articles and all other tariff and customs duties, fees, charges, fines and penalties. For the performance of such an incidental function, none of these defends its may be sued without its consent.


          WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is reversed. Suit dismissed, without costs. So ordered.
