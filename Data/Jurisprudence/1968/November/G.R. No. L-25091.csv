Judge








Pursuant to this aforecited order, a writ of execution was issued on May 9, 1964 by the Clerk of Court, and the Provincial Sheriff of Negros Oriental served the same upon the defendant in Tanjay, Negros Oriental but returned the writ unsatisfied. The second paragraph of the Sheriff's return of service, dated September 21, 1964, stated:




The judgment debtor is jobless, and is residing in the dwelling house and in the company of his widowed mother, at Tanjay, this province. Debtor has no leviable property; he is even supported by his mother. Hereto attached is the certificate of insolvency issued by the Municipal Treasurer of Tanjay, Negros Oriental, where debtor legally resides.




On October 6, 1964, counsel for the plaintiff prayed that defendant, for failure to satisfy the writ of execution, be adjudged guilty of contempt of court. On November 28, 1964, the Court issued the following order:




A U T O




A peticion del abogado Sr. Villasis que representa al demandado, y con la conformidad del abogado Sr. Tupaz, per el presente se le concede al demandado un plazo de 30 dias contar desde esta fecha, para cumplir con la decision de este Juzgado antes de que se le declare en desacato .

EDUARDO D. ENRIQUEZ	Juez








The orders for the arrest and imprisonment of the defendant, Vicente Martin, Sr., for contempt of court for failure to satisfy the judgment were illegal, in view of the following
 considerandos
:


(1)	The judgment ordering the defendant to pay past and future support at P100 per month was a final disposition of the case and was declaratory of the obligation of the defendant. The writ of execution issued on the judgment with respect to past support in the amount of about P6,000 required ""the sheriff or other proper officer"" to whom it was directed (Rule 39, Section 8, Rules of Court) to satisfy the amount out of all property, real and personal, of the judgment debtor in the manner specified in Rule 39, Section 15, of the Rules of Court. The writ of execution was, therefore, a direct order to the sheriff or other proper officer to whom it was directed, and not an order to the judgment debtor. In view thereof, the judgment debtor could not, in the very nature of things, have committed disobidience to the writ.


(2)	The sheriff's return shows that the judgment debtor was insolvent. Hence the Orders of 9 and February 1, 1965, in effect, authorized his imprisonment for debt in violation of the Constitution.


(3)	The disobidience to a judgment considered as indirect contempt in Section 3(b)of Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, does not refer to a judgment which is a final disposition of the case and which is declaratory of the rights of the parties, but to a special judgment, which is defined in Section 9, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court as a judgment ""which requires the performance of any other act than the payment of money, or the sale or delivery of real or personal property.""


According to Moran:




Generally, any order or judgement of a court finally disposing of an action should be enforced by ordinary execution proceedings, except special judgments which should be executed by contempt proceedings in accordance with Rule 39, sec. 9,"" citing Caluag, et al. vs. Pecson, et al., 82 Phil. 8. (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1963 Ed., Vol. 3, p. 320.)




IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the appealed Orders of January 9 and February 1, 1965, are hereby reversed. No costs.
