 petitioners,

vs.


HON. MACARIO ASISTIO, as Mayor of Caloocan City,
 respondent.


Cecilio Y. Arevalo, Jr. for petitioners.

Macario Asistio for and in his own behalf as respondent.


SANCHEZ, 
J.:


Petition for
 certiorari 
and prohibition to annul respondent Mayor's Public Notice (
Paunawa
) of November 26, 1967 directing that for purposes of the barrio elections of January 14, 1968, Bagong Barrio of Caloocan City embraces the remaining portions of Barrios Pacita, Manotoc, Galino and San Jose left after their mother barrios became part of Quezon City.


The petition must be dismissed. 
First
. Petitioners' averment that said portions of Barrios Pacita, Manotoc, Galino and San Jose are outside the boundaries of Bagong Barrio, as legally constituted, is disputed by respondent.
1äwphï1.ñët
 Without an established factual premise, no legal conclusion may be drawn. 
Second
. Respondent's answer herein avers that he ""has not and does not intend to enforce and execute said Public Notice (PAUNAWA) dated November 26, 1967."" The case thus is moot and academic.


Petition dismissed. No costs. So ordered.


Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Castro, Angeles and Fernando, JJ. concur.
