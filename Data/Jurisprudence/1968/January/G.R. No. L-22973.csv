ANGELES, 
J.:


An appeal from a decision, dated April 2, 1964, of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 52089, entitled ""Mambulao Lumber Company, plaintiff, versus Philippine National Bank and Anacleto Heraldo, defendants"", dismissing the complaint against both defendants and sentencing the plaintiff to pay to defendant Philippine National Bank (PNB for short) the sum of P3,582.52 with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from December 22, 1961 until fully paid, and the costs of suit. 


In seeking the reversal of the decision, the plaintiff advances several propositions in its brief which may be restated as follows:




1. That its total indebtedness to the PNB as of November 21, 1961, was only P56,485.87 and not P58,213.51 as concluded by the court 
a quo
; hence, the proceeds of the foreclosure sale of its real property alone in the amount of P56,908.00 on that date, added to the sum of P738.59 it remitted to the PNB thereafter was more than sufficient to liquidate its obligation, thereby rendering the subsequent foreclosure sale of its chattels unlawful; 


2. That it is not liable to pay PNB the amount of P5,821.35 for attorney's fees and the additional sum of P298.54 as expenses of the foreclosure sale;


3. That the subsequent foreclosure sale of its chattels is null and void, not only because it had already settled its indebtedness to the PNB at the time the sale was effected, but also for the reason that the said sale was not conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Chattel Mortgage Law and the venue agreed upon by the parties in the mortgage contract; 


4. That the PNB, having illegally sold the chattels, is liable to the plaintiff for its value; and 


5. That for the acts of the PNB in proceeding with the sale of the chattels, in utter disregard of plaintiff's vigorous opposition thereto, and in taking possession thereof after the sale thru force, intimidation, coercion, and by detaining its ""man-in-charge"" of said properties, the PNB is liable to plaintiff for damages and attorney's fees.




The antecedent facts of the case, as found by the trial court, are as follows:




On May 5, 1956 the plaintiff applied for an industrial loan of P155,000 with the Naga Branch of defendant PNB and the former offered real estate, machinery, logging and transportation equipments as collaterals. The application, however, was approved for a loan of P100,000 only. To secure the payment of the loan, the plaintiff mortgaged to defendant PNB a parcel of land, together with the buildings and improvements existing thereon, situated in the poblacion of Jose Panganiban (formerly Mambulao), province of Camarines Norte, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 381 of the land records of said province, as well as various sawmill equipment, rolling unit and other fixed assets of the plaintiff, all situated in its compound in the aforementioned municipality.


On August 2, 1956, the PNB released from the approved loan the sum of P27,500, for which the plaintiff signed a promissory note wherein it promised to pay to the PNB the said sum in five equal yearly installments at the rate of P6,528.40 beginning July 31, 1957, and every year thereafter, the last of which would be on July 31, 1961.


On October 19, 1956, the PNB made another release of P15,500 as part of the approved loan granted to the plaintiff and so on the said date, the latter executed another promissory note wherein it agreed to pay to the former the said sum in five equal yearly installments at the rate of P3,679.64 beginning July 31, 1957, and ending on July 31, 1961.


The plaintiff failed to pay the amortization on the amounts released to and received by it. Repeated demands were made upon the plaintiff to pay its obligation but it failed or otherwise refused to do so. Upon inspection and verification made by employees of the PNB, it was found that the plaintiff had already stopped operation about the end of 1957 or early part of 1958.


On September 27, 1961, the PNB sent a letter to the Provincial Sheriff of Camarines Norte requesting him to take possession of the parcel of land, together with the improvements existing thereon, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 381 of the land records of Camarines Norte, and to sell it at public auction in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 3135, as amended, for the satisfaction of the unpaid obligation of the plaintiff, which as of September 22, 1961, amounted to P57,646.59, excluding attorney's fees. In compliance with the request, on October 16, 1961, the Provincial Sheriff of Camarines Norte issued the corresponding notice of extra-judicial sale and sent a copy thereof to the plaintiff. According to the notice, the mortgaged property would be sold at public auction at 10:00 a.m. on November 21, 1961, at the ground floor of the Court House in Daet, Camarines Norte.


On November 6, 1961, the PNB sent a letter to the Provincial Sheriff of Camarines Norte requesting him to take possession of the chattels mortgaged to it by the plaintiff and sell them at public auction also on November 21, 1961, for the satisfaction of the sum of P57,646.59, plus 6% annual interest therefore from September 23, 1961, attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the amount due and the costs and expenses of the sale. On the same day, the PNB sent notice to the plaintiff that the former was foreclosing extrajudicially the chattels mortgaged by the latter and that the auction sale thereof would be held on November 21, 1961, between 9:00 and 12:00 a.m., in Mambulao, Camarines Norte, where the mortgaged chattels were situated.


On November 8, 1961, Deputy Provincial Sheriff Anacleto Heraldo took possession of the chattels mortgaged by the plaintiff and made an inventory thereof in the presence of a PC Sergeant and a policeman of the municipality of Jose Panganiban. On November 9, 1961, the said Deputy Sheriff issued the corresponding notice of public auction sale of the mortgaged chattels to be held on November 21, 1961, at 10:00 a.m., at the plaintiff's compound situated in the municipality of Jose Panganiban, Province of Camarines Norte.


On November 19, 1961, the plaintiff sent separate letters, posted as registered air mail matter, one to the Naga Branch of the PNB and another to the Provincial Sheriff of Camarines Norte, protesting against the foreclosure of the real estate and chattel mortgages on the grounds that they could not be effected unless a Court's order was issued against it (plaintiff) for said purpose and that the foreclosure proceedings, according to the terms of the mortgage contracts, should be made in Manila. In said letter to the Naga Branch of the PNB, it was intimated that if the public auction sale would be suspended and the plaintiff would be given an extension of ninety (90) days, its obligation would be settled satisfactorily because an important negotiation was then going on for the sale of its ""whole interest"" for an amount more than sufficient to liquidate said obligation.


The letter of the plaintiff to the Naga Branch of the PNB was construed by the latter as a request for extension of the foreclosure sale of the mortgaged chattels and so it advised the Sheriff of Camarines Norte to defer it to December 21, 1961, at the same time and place. A copy of said advice was sent to the plaintiff for its information and guidance. 


The foreclosure sale of the parcel of land, together with the buildings and improvements thereon, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 381, was, however, held on November 21, 1961, and the said property was sold to the PNB for the sum of P56,908.00, subject to the right of the plaintiff to redeem the same within a period of one year. On the same date, Deputy Provincial Sheriff Heraldo executed a certificate of sale in favor of the PNB and a copy thereof was sent to the plaintiff.


In a letter dated December 14, 1961 (but apparently posted several days later), the plaintiff sent a bank draft for P738.59 to the Naga Branch of the PNB, allegedly in full settlement of the balance of the obligation of the plaintiff after the application thereto of the sum of P56,908.00 representing the proceeds of the foreclosure sale of parcel of land described in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 381. In the said letter, the plaintiff reiterated its request that the foreclosure sale of the mortgaged chattels be discontinued on the grounds that the mortgaged indebtedness had been fully paid and that it could not be legally effected at a place other than the City of Manila.


In a letter dated December 16, 1961, the plaintiff advised the Provincial Sheriff of Camarines Norte that it had fully paid its obligation to the PNB, and enclosed therewith a copy of its letter to the latter dated December 14, 1961.


On December 18, 1961, the Attorney of the Naga Branch of the PNB, wrote to the plaintiff acknowledging the remittance of P738.59 with the advice, however, that as of that date the balance of the account of the plaintiff was P9,161.76, to which should be added the expenses of guarding the mortgaged chattels at the rate of P4.00 a day beginning December 19, 1961. It was further explained in said letter that the sum of P57,646.59, which was stated in the request for the foreclosure of the real estate mortgage, did not include the 10% attorney's fees and expenses of the sale. Accordingly, the plaintiff was advised that the foreclosure sale scheduled on the 21st of said month would be stopped if a remittance of P9,161.76, plus interest thereon and guarding fees, would be made.


On December 21, 1961, the foreclosure sale of the mortgaged chattels was held at 10:00 a.m. and they were awarded to the PNB for the sum of P4,200 and the corresponding bill of sale was issued in its favor by Deputy Provincial Sheriff Heraldo.


In a letter dated December 26, 1961, the Manager of the Naga Branch of the PNB advised the plaintiff giving it priority to repurchase the chattels acquired by the former at public auction. This offer was reiterated in a letter dated January 3, 1962, of the Attorney of the Naga Branch of the PNB to the plaintiff, with the suggestion that it exercise its right of redemption and that it apply for the condonation of the attorney's fees. The plaintiff did not follow the advice but on the contrary it made known of its intention to file appropriate action or actions for the protection of its interests. 


On May 24, 1962, several employees of the PNB arrived in the compound of the plaintiff in Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte, and they informed Luis Salgado, Chief Security Guard of the premises, that the properties therein had been auctioned and bought by the PNB, which in turn sold them to Mariano Bundok. Upon being advised that the purchaser would take delivery of the things he bought, Salgado was at first reluctant to allow any piece of property to be taken out of the compound of the plaintiff. The employees of the PNB explained that should Salgado refuse, he would be exposing himself to a litigation wherein he could be held liable to pay big sum of money by way of damages. Apprehensive of the risk that he would take, Salgado immediately sent a wire to the President of the plaintiff in Manila, asking advice as to what he should do. In the meantime, Mariano Bundok was able to take out from the plaintiff's compound two truckloads of equipment.


In the afternoon of the same day, Salgado received a telegram from plaintiff's President directing him not to deliver the ""chattels"" without court order, with the information that the company was then filing an action for damages against the PNB. On the following day, May 25, 1962, two trucks and men of Mariano Bundok arrived but Salgado did not permit them to take out any equipment from inside the compound of the plaintiff. Thru the intervention, however, of the local police and PC soldiers, the trucks of Mariano Bundok were able finally to haul the properties originally mortgaged by the plaintiff to the PNB, which were bought by it at the foreclosure sale and subsequently sold to Mariano Bundok.




Upon the foregoing facts, the trial court rendered the decision appealed from which, as stated in the first paragraph of this opinion, sentenced the Mambulao Lumber Company to pay to the defendant PNB the sum of P3,582.52 with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from December 22, 1961 (day following the date of the questioned foreclosure of plaintiff's chattels) until fully paid, and the costs. Mambulao Lumber Company interposed the instant appeal.


We shall discuss the various points raised in appellant's brief in 
seriatim
.


The first question Mambulao Lumber Company poses is that which relates to the amount of its indebtedness to the PNB arising out of the principal loans and the accrued interest thereon. It is contended that its obligation under the terms of the two promissory notes it had executed in favor of the PNB amounts only to P56,485.87 as of November 21, 1961, when the sale of real property was effected, and not P58,213.51 as found by the trial court.


There is merit to this claim. Examining the terms of the promissory note executed by the appellant in favor of the PNB, we find that the agreed interest on the loan of P43,000.00 — P27,500.00 released on August 2, 1956 as per promissory note of even date (Exhibit C-3), and P15,500.00 released on October 19, 1956, as per promissory note of the same date (Exhibit C-4) — was six per cent (6%) per annum from the respective date of said notes ""until paid"". In the statement of account of the appellant as of September 22, 1961, submitted by the PNB, it appears that in arriving at the total indebtedness of P57,646.59 as of that date, the PNB had compounded the principal of the loan and the accrued 6% interest thereon each time the yearly amortizations became due, and on the basis of these compounded amounts charged additional delinquency interest on them up to September 22, 1961; and to this erroneously computed total of P57,646.59, the trial court added 6% interest per annum from September 23, 1961 to November 21 of the same year. In effect, the PNB has claimed, and the trial court has adjudicated to it, 
interest on accrued interests 
from the time the various amortizations of the loan became due until the real estate mortgage executed to secure the loan was extra-judicially foreclosed on November 21, 1961. This is an error. Section 5 of Act No. 2655 expressly provides that in computing the interest on any obligation, promissory note or other instrument or contract, compound interest shall not be reckoned, except by agreement, or in default thereof, whenever the debt is judicially claimed. This is also the clear mandate of Article 2212 of the new Civil Code which provides that interest due shall earn legal interest only from the time it is judicially demanded, and of Article 1959 of the same code which ordains that interest due and unpaid shall not earn interest. Of course, the parties may, by stipulation, capitalize the interest due and unpaid, which as added principal shall earn new interest; but such stipulation is nowhere to be found in the terms of the promissory notes involved in this case. Clearly therefore, the trial court fell into error when it awarded interest on accrued interests, without any agreement to that effect and before they had been judicially demanded.


Appellant next assails the award of attorney's fees and the expenses of the foreclosure sale in favor of the PNB. With respect to the amount of P298.54 allowed as expenses of the extra-judicial sale of the real property, appellant maintains that the same has no basis, factual or legal, and should not have been awarded. It likewise decries the award of attorney's fees which, according to the appellant, should not be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the real property, not only because there is no express agreement in the real estate mortgage contract to pay attorney's fees in case the same is extra-judicially foreclosed, but also for the reason that the PNB neither spent nor incurred any obligation to pay attorney's fees in connection with the said extra-judicial foreclosure under consideration.


There is reason for the appellant to assail the award of P298.54 as expenses of the sale. In this respect, the trial court said: 




The parcel of land, together with the buildings and improvements existing thereon covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 381, was sold for P56,908. There was, however, no evidence how much was the expenses of the foreclosure sale although from the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court, the Sheriff's fees would be P1 for advertising the sale (par. k, Sec. 7, Rule 130 of the Old Rules) and P297.54 as his commission for the sale (par. n, Sec. 7, Rule 130 of the Old Rules) or a total of P298.54.




There is really no evidence of record to support the conclusion that the PNB is entitled to the amount awarded as expenses of the extra-judicial foreclosure sale. The court below committed error in applying the provisions of the Rules of Court for purposes of arriving at the amount awarded. It is to be borne in mind that the fees enumerated under paragraphs k and n, Section 7, of Rule 130 (now Rule 141) are demandable, only by a sheriff serving processes of the court in connection with judicial foreclosure of mortgages under Rule 68 of the new Rules, and not in cases of extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgages under Act 3135. The law applicable is Section 4 of Act 3135 which provides that the officer conducting the sale is entitled to collect a fee of P5.00 for each day of actual work performed in addition to his expenses in connection with the foreclosure sale. Admittedly, the PNB failed to prove during the trial of the case, that it actually spent any amount in connection with the said foreclosure sale. Neither may expenses for publication of the notice be legally allowed in the absence of evidence on record to support it.
 1 
It is true, as pointed out by the appellee bank, that courts should take judicial notice of the fees provided for by law which need not be proved; but in the absence of evidence to show at least the number of working days the sheriff concerned actually spent in connection with the extra-judicial foreclosure sale, the most that he may be entitled to, would be the amount of P10.00 as a reasonable allowance for two day's work — one for the preparation of the necessary notices of sale, and the other for conducting the auction sale and issuance of the corresponding certificate of sale in favor of the buyer. Obviously, therefore, the award of P298.54 as expenses of the sale should be set aside.


But the claim of the appellant that the real estate mortgage does not provide for attorney's fees in case the same is extra-judicially foreclosed, cannot be favorably considered, as would readily be revealed by an examination of the pertinent provision of the mortgage contract. The parties to the mortgage appear to have stipulated under paragraph (c) thereof, 
inter alia
:




. . . For the purpose of extra-judicial foreclosure, the Mortgagor hereby appoints the Mortgagee his attorney-in-fact to sell the property mortgaged under Act 3135, as amended, to sign all documents and to perform all acts requisite and necessary to accomplish said purpose and to appoint its substitute as such attorney-in-fact with the same powers as above specified. In case of judicial foreclosure, the Mortgagor hereby consents to the appointment of the Mortgagee or any of its employees as receiver, without any bond, to take charge of the mortgaged property at once, and to hold possession of the same and the rents, benefits and profits derived from the mortgaged property before the sale, less the costs and expenses of the receivership; the Mortgagor hereby agrees further that in all cases, attorney's fees hereby fixed at Ten Per cent (10%) of the total indebtedness then unpaid which in no case shall be less than P100.00 exclusive of all fees allowed by law, and the expenses of collection shall be the obligation of the Mortgagor and shall with priority, be paid to the Mortgagee out of any sums realized as rents and profits derived from the mortgaged property or from the proceeds realized from the sale of the said property and this mortgage shall likewise stand as security therefor. . . .




We find the above stipulation to pay attorney's fees clear enough to cover both cases of foreclosure sale mentioned thereunder, i.e., judicially or extra-judicially. While the phrase ""in all cases"" appears to be part of the second sentence, a reading of the whole context of the stipulation would readily show that it logically refers to extra-judicial foreclosure found in the first sentence and to judicial foreclosure mentioned in the next sentence. And the ambiguity in the stipulation suggested and pointed out by the appellant by reason of the faulty sentence construction should not be made to defeat the otherwise clear intention of the parties in the agreement.


It is suggested by the appellant, however, that even if the above stipulation to pay attorney's fees were applicable to the extra-judicial foreclosure sale of its real properties, still, the award of P5,821.35 for attorney's fees has no legal justification, considering the circumstance that the PNB did not actually spend anything by way of attorney's fees in connection with the sale. In support of this proposition, appellant cites authorities to the effect: (1) that when the mortgagee has neither paid nor incurred any obligation to pay an attorney in connection with the foreclosure sale, the claim for such fees should be denied;
 2 
and (2) that attorney's fees will not be allowed when the attorney conducting the foreclosure proceedings is an officer of the corporation (mortgagee) who receives a salary for all the legal services performed by him for the corporation. 
3 
These authorities are indeed enlightening; but they should not be applied in this case. The very same authority first cited suggests that said principle is not absolute, for there is authority to the contrary. As to the fact that the foreclosure proceeding's were handled by an attorney of the legal staff of the PNB, we are reluctant to exonerate herein appellant from the payment of the stipulated attorney's fees on this ground alone, considering the express agreement between the parties in the mortgage contract under which appellant became liable to pay the same. At any rate, we find merit in the contention of the appellant that the award of P5,821.35 in favor of the PNB as attorney's fees is unconscionable and unreasonable, considering that all that the branch attorney of the said bank did in connection with the foreclosure sale of the real property was to file a petition with the provincial sheriff of Camarines Norte requesting the latter to sell the same in accordance with the provisions of Act 3135.


The principle that courts should reduce stipulated attorney's fees whenever it is found under the circumstances of the case that the same is unreasonable, is now deeply rooted in this jurisdiction to entertain any serious objection to it. Thus, this Court has explained: 




But the principle that it may be lawfully stipulated that the legal expenses involved in the collection of a debt shall be defrayed by the debtor does not imply that such stipulations must be enforced in accordance with the terms, no matter how injurious or oppressive they may be. The lawful purpose to be accomplished by such a stipulation is to permit the creditor to receive the amount due him under his contract without a deduction of the expenses caused by the delinquency of the debtor. It should not be permitted for him to convert such a stipulation into a source of speculative profit at the expense of the debtor.


Contracts for attorney's services in this jurisdiction stands upon an entirely different footing from contracts for the payment of compensation for any other services. By express provision of section 29 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an attorney is not entitled in the absence of express contract to recover more than a reasonable compensation for his services; and even when an express contract is made the court can ignore it and limit the recovery to reasonable compensation if the amount of the stipulated fee is found by the court to be unreasonable. This is a very different rule from that announced in section 1091 of the Civil Code with reference to the obligation of contracts in general, where it is said that such obligation has the force of law between the contracting parties. Had the plaintiff herein made an express contract to pay his attorney an uncontingent fee of P2,115.25 for the services to be rendered in reducing the note here in suit to judgment, it would not have been enforced against him had he seen fit to oppose it, as such a fee is obviously far greater than is necessary to remunerate the attorney for the work involved and is therefore unreasonable. In order to enable the court to ignore an express contract for an attorney's fees, it is not necessary to show, as in other contracts, that it is contrary to morality or public policy (Art. 1255, Civil Code). It is enough that it is unreasonable or unconscionable. 
4 




Since then this Court has invariably fixed counsel fees on a 
quantum meruit
 basis whenever the fees stipulated appear excessive, unconscionable, or unreasonable, because a lawyer is primarily a court officer charged with the duty of assisting the court in administering impartial justice between the parties, and hence, the fees should be subject to judicial control. Nor should it be ignored that sound public policy demands that courts disregard stipulations for counsel fees, whenever they appear to be a source of speculative profit at the expense of the debtor or mortgagor.
 5 
And it is not material that the present action is between the debtor and the creditor, and not between attorney and client. As court have power to fix the fee as between attorney and client, it must necessarily have the right to say whether a stipulation like this, inserted in a mortgage contract, is valid.
 6 


In determining the compensation of an attorney, the following circumstances should be considered: the amount and character of the services rendered; the responsibility imposed; the amount of money or the value of the property affected by the controversy, or involved in the employment; the skill and experience called for in the performance of the service; the professional standing of the attorney; the results secured; and whether or not the fee is contingent or absolute, it being a recognized rule that an attorney may properly charge a much larger fee when it is to be contingent than when it is not.
 7 
From the stipulation in the mortgage contract earlier quoted, it appears that the agreed fee is 10% of the total indebtedness, irrespective of the manner the foreclosure of the mortgage is to be effected. The agreement is perhaps fair enough in case the foreclosure proceedings is prosecuted judicially but, surely, it is unreasonable when, as in this case, the mortgage was foreclosed extra-judicially, and all that the attorney did was to file a petition for foreclosure with the sheriff concerned. It is to be assumed though, that the said branch attorney of the PNB made a study of the case before deciding to file the petition for foreclosure; but even with this in mind, we believe the amount of P5,821.35 is far too excessive a fee for such services. Considering the above circumstances mentioned, it is our considered opinion that the amount of P1,000.00 would be more than sufficient to compensate the work aforementioned.


The next issue raised deals with the claim that the proceeds of the sale of the real properties alone together with the amount it remitted to the PNB later was more than sufficient to liquidate its total obligation to herein appellee bank. Again, we find merit in this claim. From the foregoing discussion of the first two errors assigned, and for purposes of determining the total obligation of herein appellant to the PNB as of November 21, 1961 when the real estate mortgage was foreclosed, we have the following illustration in support of this conclusion:
