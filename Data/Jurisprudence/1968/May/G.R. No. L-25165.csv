DIZON, 
J.:


Our resolution of February 9, 1968 granted the Solicitor General a 20th extension of fifteen days from January 22, 1968 within which to file appellee's brief.


On February 15, 1968, the Solicitor General filed a motion praying, for the reasons therein given, that the period within which to file his brief for the appellee be suspended or, in the event such relief was denied, that he be granted a period of fifteen days from February 6, 1968 within which to file appellee's brief.

Subsequent to the filing of the above motion, the Solicitor General filed on February 20, 1968 another petition for a fifteen-day extension of the period for the filing of appellee's brief beginning from February 21, 1968. This was followed by a similar petition for another fifteen-day extension filed on March 7, 1968; then by a similar petition for a fifteen-day extension filed on March 21, 1968, the extended period to begin from March 22, 1968; then by a similar petition filed on April 2, 1968 for another fifteen-day extension beginning April 6, 1968 and lastly, by another petition for a fifteen-day extension filed on April 22, the extended period to start on April 21.


As the petitions for extension filed subsequent to our resolution of February 9, 1968 have remained unresolved because the 
rollo
 of the case was misplaced, We hereby decide to grant them all, and in connection with the last petition for extension, it is hereby resolved that the fifteen-day period therein prayer for shall be computed from today, May 16, 1968, and should be considered as a last and final extension. So ordered.
