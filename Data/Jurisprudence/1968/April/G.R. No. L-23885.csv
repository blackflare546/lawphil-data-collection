R E S O L U T I O N


SANCHEZ, 
J.:


Contestants for the mayoralty post of Pagsanjan, Laguna, in the November 12, 1963 elections were Fidelino C. Agawin, the Nacionalista Party candidate and Quintin Cabrera for the Liberal Party. Cabrera was proclaimed winner on November 14, 1963. Agawin protested.
1
 His grounds: frauds, corrupt practices, over spending vote-buying and other illegal election practices which he described in said protest. Cabrera answered and asserted a counter protest.


Upon respondent judge's order, a revision of ballots was made and completed. Thereafter, Cabrera moved for the dismissal of the protest alleging that it was filed beyond the reglementary period and that protestant's certificate of candidacy was filed in the wrong office,
2
 a jurisdictional defect which was not cured by the amended protest as the latter was lodged beyond the two-week reglementary period for filing an election protest.


On July 11, 1964, respondent judge ruled that protestant's certificate of candidacy was filed with the wrong body, dismissed the protest with costs against protestant.

Reconsideration failed of its purpose.


Claiming grave abuse of discretion in the issuance of the dismissal order, protestant Agawin came to this Court on 
certiorari
.


In the recent elections of November, 1967, petitioner and respondent Cabrera again faced each other for the same position. Cabrera, won; Agawin again protested.


Since the contested term of office in the case at bar (1964-1967) has expired, any decision now can no longer be given any practical effect.

IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the petition is hereby dismissed. No costs. So ordered.


Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Castro, Angeles and Fernando, JJ., concur.

Zaldivar J., took no part.

Concepcion, C.J., is on leave.
