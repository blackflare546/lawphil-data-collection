FERNANDO, 
J.:


In this petition for the correction of birth certificates, petitioners, Antonio Lee, Manuel Victorio Lee and Iluminada Lee, sought the correction by the Local Civil Registrar of Pasay City of data appearing in their records of birth to change their nationality from 
Chinese
 to
 Filipino
 and their status from
 legitimate
 to
 illegitimate
. The last named petitioner is their mother, Laureana Tirona, who likewise would change her civil status from 
married
 to
 single
. The lower court, presided by the then Judge, now Justice of the Court of Appeals, Angel H. Mojica, applying the Ty Kong Tin decision,
1
 dismissed the petition.


Petitioners appealed, their counsel stressing that while not unaware of decisions of this Court in cases of a similar nature, he would avail himself of the opportunity to discuss the matter more thoroughly in the hope that thereby he ""could evoke a decision clear enough to guide future litigants,"" admitting at the same time that the corrections sought by petitioners ""would result in substantial change affecting the citizenship and the status of appellants.""
2
 There is no warrant for the slightest optimism on the part of petitioners. Such a hope is in vain.


It would be to overturn a long list of cases, impressive for their number and their unanimity, upholding the Ty Kong Tin decision, for this petition to prosper.
3
 To abandon such a doctrine which has in its favor adherence to a sound policy is unthinkable. Necessarily then, reliance on petitions of this character for the far-from-commendable purpose of changing one's nationality should continue to be frowned upon and discouraged.


What was set forth in 
Chug Siu v. Civil Registrar of Manila
4
 bears reiteration. Thus: ""One of the most emphatic affirmations against the utilization of this mode of procedure to obtain a judicial declaration of citizenship comes from the pen of former Chief Justice Bengzon in the above cited 1964 decision of 
Reyes v. Republic
. Thus: 'The case before us is not of first impression. We have repeatedly declared that in this jurisdiction, the remedy sought in the instant petition cannot be granted in the manner desired. While ostensibly, the action seeks a mere correction of an entry in the Civil Registry, in effect, it requests the judicial declaration of Philippine citizenship. Many such cases this Court has dismissed. We have clearly stated time and again, declaratory relief is not available for the purpose of obtaining a judicial declaration of citizenship.""


WHEREFORE, the decision of the lower court is affirmed. With costs against petitioners.
