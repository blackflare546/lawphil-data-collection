CAPISTRANO, 
J.:


Manila Ordinance No. 6485, effective January 1, 1968, created the position of City Legal Officer and the positions of his staff, and appropriated the necessary amount for their salaries. This Ordinance was passed pursuant to Section 19 of Republic Act No. 5185, otherwise known as the Decentralization Act of 1967, which authorizes a city to create said positions to enable the city to avail itself of ""full time and trusted services."" For this purpose, continues the law, ""the functions hitherto performed by the ... city fiscals in serving as legal adviser and legal officer for civil cases of the ... city shall be transferred to the ... city legal officer....""


On January 23, 1968, Mayor Antonio J. Villegas appointed Gregorio A. Ejercito as City Legal Officer effective January 1, 1968. On the same day Mayor Villegas designated Ejercito City Legal Officer ""[i]n the interest of the public service and in order to enable the Office of the City Legal Officer, which was created effective January 1, 1968, to immediately start functioning."" The Mayor also made appointments to the staff of the City Legal Officer, as follows:
