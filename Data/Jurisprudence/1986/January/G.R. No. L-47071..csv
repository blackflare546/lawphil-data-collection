AQUINO, 
C.J.:


On January 19, 1961 the Lopez spouses filed an action to enjoin the foreclosure of the mortgage. On August 31, 1962 Bermejo sued the Lopez spouses for the recovery of the mortgaged lands. A receiver was appointed. The two cases were tried jointly.


The Lopez spouses presented their evidence before Judge Debuque. The Bermejos presented their evidence before Judge Leonidas. The trial lasted ten years. The evidence is voluminous.


The trial court in its decision dated May 18, 1973 declared valid the mortgage and its extrajudicial foreclosure and awarded damages to the Bermejos. The Appellate Court affirmed that judgment with the modification that the damages awarded to the Bermejos was reduced to P10,000. The Lopez spouses appealed to this Court. After the briefs had been filed, or on December 7, 1985, the parties submitted the following:
