SECOND DIVISION


G.R. No. L-41806	August 19, 1986


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, 
plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


BERNARDO HERMOSADA, 
accused-appellant.
 


The Solicitor General for plaintiff-appellee. 


Israel D. Damasco for accused-appellant.


FERNAN, 
J.:


Accused-appellant Bernardo Hermosada seeks a reversal of his conviction for the crime of rape on a lone assignment of error, to wit: 


Â 




THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED- APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DOUBTFUL, INAPPROPRIATE AND UNREALISTIC TESTIMONY OF THE OFFENDED GIRL ON THE MANNER SAID CRIME WAS COMMITTED AGAINST HER. 
1




A complaint for rape against accused-appellant was filed on January 12, 1973 with the Municipal Court of Maramag by the offended party, Visitacion Romeo. 
2
 After a preliminary investigation was conducted, the Provincial Fiscal filed the following information before the then Court of First Instance of Bukidnon on March 9, 1973: 




That on or about the 15th day of December, 1972, in the afternoon, at barrio Kiharong, municipality of Maramag, province of Bukidnon, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design and with intent to rape VISITACION ROMEO, a twelve [12] year old child by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and criminally wrestle with the offended party, throw her to the ground and pin her on the ground, remove her drawers, placed himself on top of her and have sexual intercourse with her against her will. 


Contrary to and in violation of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. 
3






The accused having pleaded not guilty upon arraignment, the case proceeded to trial. 


The prosecution presented three [3] witnesses, namely: Municipal Judge Loreto Tumampos, before whom the criminal complaint was filed and subscribed to; Visitacion Romeo, the offended party, and Dr. Adoracion de la Cerna, supervising resident physician of the Bukidnon Hospital, who undertook a physical and internal examination of the victim. The defense, on the other hand, presented the accused himself, who denied the commission of the crime and offered an alibi as a defense, and two other witnesses, Gorgonio Canoy and Bonifacio Balindes, who corroborated the accused's alibi. 


On August 20, 1974, the trial court rendered a decision, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, to indemnify his victim in the sum of P6,000.00 as moral damages for injuries to her feelings, and to pay the costs. 


Accused Hermosada forthwith filed a notice of appeal. Hence, this review. 


At the time of the commission of the crime, the victim, Visitacion Romeo, was 12 years old and a grade V student at the Kisanday Elementary School. She walked the three-kilometer distance between her house and school, in the morning with her seven-year-old sister, Hermelina, who was then in Grade One, and alone, in the late afternoon, as her sister would go home at noon. It was while she was on her way home from school in the late afternoon of December 15, 1972 that she was allegedly raped by the accused-appellant, then 62 years old, a widower and a carpenter by profession. Visitacion knew the accused-appellant, as he had been hired by her father three months before to construct their house and he would eat his meals with her family. Her testimony as to the manner the crime was committed is as follows:

The certificate prepared by Dr. de la Cerna on the medical examination conducted on the victim on December 20, 1972 reads as follows: 




P.E. 


-Ambulatory, coherent, conscious, fairly nourished. 


-Healing contused abrasion knee right. 


I.E.


-Hymen -no laceration 


-Labia Minora with erythema and contusion right side. 
6




Elaborating on this report at the witness stand, Dr. de la Cerna testified that the contusion and abrasion on the knee of Visitacion could have been caused by the forceful application of a blunt instrument and/or contact with a rough object like the ground. She likewise stated that the reddening and swelling of the external genitalia could have been caused by the forceful application of a blunt instrument like a man's private part. 
7
 


The defense contends that the testimony of the offended party that the accused-appellant was lying on top of her and nothing more happened or he was executing' a push and pull movement but his penis was unmoving inside her vagina or his penis was not in an erect or standing position, is a clear indication that rape was not committed or of guess-work or even an open declaration of innocence or lack of knowledge of a young girl, like the victim in this case, of the manner sexual intercourse is being performed. 


We do not agree with this assessment. As earlier noted, the victim was twelve years old at the time of the commission of the crime, and thirteen, when she testified in court. Naturally, she cannot be expected to be well-versed in topics such as sex and sexual intercourse. Nonetheless, the trial court which had the full opportunity to study and observe her demeanor at close range accorded full credence to her testimony, thus: 




. . . The Court cannot find any reason to doubt the credibility of said offended party who delivered her testimony in a straightforward manner despite her tender

years. 
8
 




We have thoroughly read and in fact reproduced the pertinent portions of Visitacion's testimony and, like the trial judge, are convinced of its veracity. Visitacion Romeo was able to narrate with simplicity and sufficient clarity the manner by which the crime against her chastity was committed. Had she been more vivid and eloquent in her description, We would have suspected her story to be a mere fabrication. As it is, her recital of the details of the event under consideration dovetails with the findings of Dr. de la Cerna. Thus, her testimony that her knees hit the ground when the accused-appellant pushed her is corroborated by the report of Dr. de la Cerna that at the time of the examination, she had a healing contused abrasion on the right knee. As accused-appellant was holding her by the right hand, it was natural that her weight would fall on her right knee. Her statement that accused-appellant was executing a push and pull movement, but his penis was unmoving inside her vagina is explained by the fact that there was no complete penetration; hence, no laceration of the hymen, but merely erythema or reddening and contusion on the right side of the labia minora, which Dr. de la Cerna stated could have been caused by a blunt instrument like a man's private part. 


Incomplete penetration, however, does not mean that rape was not committed. For rape to be consummated, proof of entrance of the male organ within the labia of the pudendum is sufficient. 
9
 By the positive testimony of Visitacion, corroborated by the medical findings of Dr. de la Cerna, there can be no doubt that there was such penetration, however slight. 


Accused-appellant, likewise, tries to discredit the victim's story by focusing on the behavior of her parents after they learned of her sad experience. He contends that the victim's parents were indifferent and unconcerned about the alleged crime and practically did nothing to avenge the same. 


We do not find it to be so. When Visitacion reported the incident to her mother immediately upon reaching home, the latter cried. After the accused-appellant arrived at about 9:00 o'clock that evening, Visitacion's mother did not do anything because her husband, Pedro Romeo, was in their other house in Pig-awakan about two kilometers away. 
10
 
Taking into consideration the psychological make-up of married Filipinas, particularly those residing in the barrios at that time [1972], this reaction is hardly unusual. Basically submissive and deferential to the husband's judgment, a Filipina married woman would not take any drastic action as might have been needed in the case at bar without first consulting her husband. Thus, as later events would prove, when her husband arrived from Pig-awakan the following morning, he berated the accused-appellant after learning what the latter did so that said accused-appellant did not eat his supper with them the following evening. 
11
 Thereafter, Pedro Romeo reported the incident to the PC headquarters at Malaybalay and brought Visitacion to the hospital for medical examination. The actuations of Visitacion's parents are certainly no indication of unconcern or indifference. On the contrary, they are more in keeping with the Filipino tradition of requiring a ""family consensus to be arrived at first before a family dishonor can be made public by reporting to the authorities. "" 
12


Finding no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the trial court, conviction of the accused-appellant must be sustained. 


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed. 


SO ORDERED. 


Feria (Chairman), Alampay, Gutierrez, Jr. and Paras, JJ., concur.
