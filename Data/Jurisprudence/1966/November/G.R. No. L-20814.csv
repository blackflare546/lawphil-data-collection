IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. CARMEN DY 
alias 
DY GIOK KHA,

vs.


REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES,
 oppositor-appellant. 


Valeriano S. Kaamiño for petitioner and appellee.

Office of the Solicitor General for oppositor and appellant.


CONCEPCION, 
C.J.:


Appeal by the Solicitor General from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental granting the petition for naturalization, as citizen of the Philippines, of appellee Carmen Dy.


Upon a review of the record, we are satisfied that said petition should be dismissed, for:


1. Petitioner has no lucrative occupation, it being alleged in her petition that her income is P2,400 a year, or P200 a month, which is far from being ""lucrative"" within the purview of the Naturalization Law, considering that she has six (6) children, five (5) of them dependent upon her and of school age.
1
 In fact, her gross receipts in 1959 amounted to P1,713.16 only.


2. In her declaration of intention, as well as in her petition herein, petitioner stated that her name is Carmen Dy 
alias 
Dy Giok Kha; but her birth certificate, dated May 13, 1924, shows that she was born and baptized with the name Carmen Dy. This is confirmed by her alien certificate of registration dated November 28, 1945. However, her immigration certificate of residence, issued in 1951, shows that she then began to use the ""alias Dy Giok Kha"". It is not disputed that petitioner had secured no previous judicial authority for the use of said alias. In other words, she has violated the Anti-Alias Law, which is sufficient ground to deny her application for naturalization.
2


3. Petitioner has, not evinced a sincere desire to embrace the customs and traditions of the Filipinos, she having enrolled everyone of her six (6) children in Chinese schools. Although, 
after 
the filing of her petition for naturalization, petitioner transferred two (2) of them to a Catholic school, this circumstance — apart from having been obviously influenced by the present proceedings — does not detract from the fact that her behavior, at the time of the commencement thereof and prior thereto, showed a lack of earnest intention to identify herself and her children with the Filipino community.
3


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby reversed, and the petition for naturalization herein dismissed, with costs against petitioner Carmen Dy. It is so ordered.
