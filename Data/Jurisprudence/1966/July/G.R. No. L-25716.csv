 respondents.

Sycip and Salazar for respondents.


CONCEPCION, 
C.J.:


Petitioner Fernando Lopez and respondent Gerardo Roxas were the main contenders for the Office of Vice-President of the Philippines in the general elections held on November 9, 1965. By Resolution No. 2, approved on December 17, 1965, the two Houses of Congress, in joint session assembled as the board charged with the duty to canvass the votes then cast for President and Vice President of the Philippines, proclaimed petitioner Fernando Lopez elected to the latter office with 3,531,550 votes, or a plurality of 26,724 votes over his closest opponent, respondent Gerardo M. Roxas, in whose favor 3,504,826 votes had been tallied, according to said resolution. On January 5, 1966, respondent filed, with the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, Election Protest No. 2, contesting the election of petitioner herein as Vice-President of the Philippines, upon the ground that it was not he, but said respondent, who had obtained the largest number of votes for said office.


On February 22, 1966, petitioner Lopez instituted in the Supreme Court the present original action, for prohibition with preliminary injunction, against respondent Roxas, to prevent the Presidential Electoral Tribunal from hearing and deciding the aforementioned election contest, upon the ground that Republic Act No. 1793, creating said Tribunal, is ""unconstitutional,"" and that, ""all proceedings taken by it are a nullity.""


Petitioner's contention is predicated upon the ground, that Congress may not, by law, authorize an election contest for President and Vice-President, the Constitution being silent thereon; that such contest tends to nullify the constitutional authority of Congress to proclaim the candidates elected for President and Vice-President; that the recount of votes by the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, as an incident of an election contest, is inconsistent with the exclusive power of Congress to canvass the election returns for the President and the Vice-President; that no amendment to the Constitution providing for an election protest involving the office of President and Vice-President has been adopted, despite the constitutional amendment governing election contests for Members of Congress; that the tenure of the President and the Vice-President is fixed by the Constitution and cannot be abridged by an Act of Congress, like Republic Act No. 1793; that said Act has the effect of amending the Constitution, in that it permits the Presidential Electoral Tribunal to review the congressional proclamation of the president-elect and the vice-president-elect; that the constitutional convention had rejected the original plan to include in the Constitution a provision authorizing election contest affecting the president-elect and the vice-president-elect before an electoral commission; that the people understood the Constitution to authorize election contests only for Members of Congress, not for President and Vice-President, and, in interpreting the Constitution, the people's intent is paramount; that it is illegal for Justices of the Supreme Court to sit as members of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, since the decisions thereof are appealable to the Supreme Court on questions of law; that the Presidential Electoral Tribunal is a court inferior to the Supreme Court; and that Congress cannot by legislation appoint in effect the members of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal.


Pursuant to the Constitution, ""the Judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as may be established by law.
1


This provision vests in the judicial branch of the government, not merely 
some
 specified or 
limited
 judicial power, but ""the"" judicial power under our political system, and, accordingly, the entirety or ""all"" of said power, except, only, so much as the Constitution confers upon some other agency, such as the power to ""judge all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications"" of members of the Senate and those of the House of Representatives which is vested by the fundamental law solely in the Senate Electoral Tribunal and the House Electoral Tribunal, respectively.
2


Judicial power is the authority to settle justiciable controversies or disputes involving rights that are enforceable and demandable before the courts of justice or the redress of wrongs for violations of such rights.
3
 The proper exercise of said authority requires legislative action: (1) defining such enforceable and demandable rights and/or prescribing remedies for violations thereof; and (2) determining the court with jurisdiction to hear and decide said controversies or disputes, in the first instance and/or on appeal. For this reason, the Constitution ordains that ""Congress shall have the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of the various courts,"" subject to the limitations set forth in the fundamental law.
4


Prior to the approval of Republic Act No. 1793, a defeated candidate for president or vice-president, who believe that he was the candidate who obtained the largest number of votes for either office, despite the proclamation by Congress of another candidate as the president-elect or vice-president-elect, had 
no
 legal right to demand by election protest a recount of the votes cast for the office concerned, to establish his right thereto. As a consequence, controversies or disputes on this matter were 
not justiciable
.
5


Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1793, which provides that:




There shall be an independent Presidential Electoral Tribunal ... which shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the president-elect and the vice-president-elect of the Philippines.




has the effect of giving said defeated candidate the legal right to contest judicially the election of the President-elect or Vice-President-elect and to demand a recount of the votes cast for the office involved in the litigation as well as to secure a judgment declaring that he
6
 is the one elected president or vice-president, as the case may be,
7
 and that, as such, he is entitled to assume the duties attached to said office. And by providing, further, that the Presidential Electoral Tribunal ""shall be composed of the Chief Justice and the other ten Members of the Supreme Court,"" said legislation has conferred upon such Court an 
additional
 original jurisdiction of an exclusive character.
8


Republic Act No. 1793 has 
not
 created a new or separate court. It has merely conferred upon the Supreme Court the 
functions
 of a Presidential Electoral Tribunal. The result of the enactment may be likened to the fact that courts of first instance perform the functions of such ordinary courts of first instance,
9
 those of court of land registration, 
10
 those of probate courts, 
11
 and those of courts of juvenile and domestic relations. 
12
 It is, also, comparable to the situation obtaining when the municipal court of a provincial capital exercises its authority, pursuant to law, over a limited number of cases which were previously within the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of first instance. 
13


In all of these instances, the 
court
 (court of first instance or municipal court) is only 
one
, although the 
functions
 may be 
distinct
 and, even, 
separate
. Thus the powers of a court of first instance, in the exercise of its jurisdiction over ordinary civil cases, are broader than, as well as distinct and separate from, those of the same court acting as a court of 
land registration
 or a
 probate
 court, or as a court of juvenile and domestic relations. So too, the authority of the municipal court of a provincial capital, when acting as such municipal court, is, territorially more limited than that of the 
same court
 when hearing the aforementioned cases which are primary within the jurisdiction of courts of first instance. In other words, there is only 
one court
, although it may perform the 
functions
 pertaining to several types of courts, each having some characteristics different from those of the others.


Indeed, the Supreme Court, 
14
 the Court of Appeals 
15
 and courts of first instance, 
16
 are vested with original jurisdiction, as well as with appellate jurisdiction, in consequence of which they are booth trial courts and appellate courts, without detracting from the fact that there is only one Supreme Court, 
one
 Court of Appeals, and 
one
 court of first instance, clothed with authority to discharged said dual functions. A court of first instance, when performing the functions of a probate court or a court of land registration, or a court of juvenile and domestic relations, although with powers less broad than those of a court of first instance, hearing ordinary actions, is 
not
 
inferior
 to the latter, for one cannot be inferior to itself. So too, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal is 
not
 inferior to the Supreme Court, since it is 
the same Court
 although the 
functions
 peculiar to said Tribunal are 
more
 limited in scope than those of the Supreme Court in the exercise of its ordinary functions. Hence, the enactment of Republic Act No. 1793, does not entail an assumption by Congress of the power of appointment vested by the Constitution in the President. It merely connotes the imposition of additional duties upon the Members of the Supreme Court. 
17


Moreover, the power to be the ""judge ... of ... contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications"" of any public officer is essentially judicial. As such — under the very principle of separation of powers invoked by petitioner herein — it belongs 
exclusively
 to the 
judicial
 department, except only insofar as the Constitution provides otherwise. This is precisely the reason why said organic law ordains that ""the Senate and the House of Representatives shall each have an Electoral Tribunal which shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of their respective Members"" (Article VI, Section 11, of the Constitution). In other words, the purpose of this provision was to 
exclude
 the power to decide such contests relating to Members of Congress — 
which by nature is judicial
 
18
 — from the operation of the general grant of judicial power 
19
 to ""the Supreme Court and such inferior courts as may be established by law.


Instead of indicating that Congress may not enact Republic Act No. 1793, the aforementioned provision of the Constitution, establishing said Electoral Tribunals for Members of Congress only, proves the exact opposite, namely: that the Constitution intended to vest Congress with discretion 
20
 to determine by law whether or 
not
 the election of a president-elect or that of a vice-president-elect may be contested and, if Congress should decide in the affirmative, 
which court of justice
 shall have jurisdiction to hear the contest. 
It is, even, debatable
 whether such jurisdiction may be conferred, by statute, to a board, commission or tribunal composed partly of Members of Congress and Members of the Supreme Court because of its possible inconsistency with the constitutional grant of 
the
 judicial power to ""the Supreme Court and ... such inferior courts as may be established by law,"" for said board, commission or tribunal would be neither ""the Supreme Court, 
21
 nor, certainly, ""such inferior courts as, may be established by law.""


It follows, therefore, not only that Republic Act No. 1793 is 
not inconsistent with
 the Constitution or with the principle of separation of powers underlying the same, but, also, that 
it is in harmony
 with the aforementioned grant of ""the judicial power"" to said courts. Indeed, when Claro M. Recto, Chairman of the Constitutional Convention, proposed that the original move therein to include in the fundamental law a provision creating an Electoral Commission 
22
 to hear election contests against the President-elect and the Vice-President-elect, be given up, he expressed the view that the elimination of said provision would have the effect of leaving in the hands of the legislative department the power to decide what entity or body would ""look into the protests for the positions of President and Vice-President."" 
23
 Twenty-two (22) years later, or on May 3, 1957 then Senator Recto reiterated this view, when, in the course of the debates on the Bill which later became Republic Act No. 1793, he stated:




... Mr. President, as far as I can remember, the intention of the constitutional convention was to leave this matter to ordinary legislation.




Such was, also, the impression of Dr. Jose M. Aruego, another prominent Member of the Convention, who says 
24
 that




Election protests for the Presidency and the Vice-Presidendency were left to be judged in a manner and 
by a body decided by the National Assembly
. (Emphasis ours.)




No less than one of the main counsel for petitioner herein, himself, another delegate to the Constitutional Convention, evidently shared this view as late as September 30, 1965, for the introduction to his 1965 edition of ""the Revised Election Code"" states that ""he will always be remembered for ... his famous bill creating the Presidential Electoral Tribunal ..."". Indeed as a member of the Senate, on January 3, 1950, he Introduced Senate Bill No. 1 seeking to create a Presidential Electoral Tribunal ""to try, hear and decide protests contesting the election of the President and the Vice-President of the Philippines"", which shall be composed of three Justices of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice, and four Senators and four Members of the House of Representatives.


Then, again, the records of the Convention show, that in voting eventually to eliminate, from the draft of the Constitution, the provision establishing a Presidential Electoral Commission, the delegates were influenced by the fact that there was no similar provision in the Federal Constitution of the United States. Having followed the pattern thereof, it must be assumed, therefore, in the absence of any indicium to the contrary,
25
 that the Convention had adhered, also, to the interpretation given to this feature of said Federal Constitution, as may be deduced from the fact that, by an act of Congress of the United States, approved on January 29, 1877, an Electoral Commission was created to hear and decide certain issues concerning the election of the President of said nation held in 1876. It is, also worthy of notice that pursuant to said Act, nothing therein ""shall be held to impair or affect any right now existing under the Constitution and laws to question, 
by proceedings in the judicial courts of the United States
, the right or title of the person who shall be declared elected, or who shall claim to be President or Vice-President of the United States, if any such right exists"". 
26
 Thus the absence of a provision in said Federal Constitution governing protests against the election of the President and the Vice-President had been construed to be 
without prejudice
 to the right of the defeated candidate to file a protest 
before the courts of justice
 of the United States, 
if the laws thereof permitted it
. In other words, the Federal Congress was deemed clothed with authority to determine, by ordinary legislation, whether or not protests against the election of said officers may properly be entertained by the judicial department.


Needless to say, the power of congress to declare who, among the candidates for President and/or Vice-President, has obtained the largest number of votes, is entirely different in nature from and not inconsistent with the jurisdiction vested in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal by Republic Act No. 1793. Congress merely acts as a national board of canvassers, charged with the 
ministerial
 and 
executive
 duty 
27
 to make said declaration, on the basis of the election returns duly certified by provincial and city boards of canvassers. 
28
 Upon the other hand, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal has the 
judicial
 power to determine whether or not said duly certified election returns have been irregularly made or tampered with, or reflect the true result of the elections in the areas covered by each, and, if not, to recount the ballots cast, and, incidentally thereto, pass upon the validity of each ballot or determine whether the same shall be counted, and, in the affirmative, in whose favor, 
which Congress has power to do
.


It is, likewise, patent that the aforementioned authority of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal to determine whether or not the protestant has a better right than the President and/or the Vice-President declared elected by Congress would not abridge the constitutional tenure. If the evidence introduced in the election protest shows that the person really elected president or vice-president is the protestant, not the person declared elected by Congress, then the latter had legally 
no
 constitutional tenure whatsoever, and, hence, he can claim no abridgement thereof.

It is similarly obvious that, in imposing upon the Supreme Court the additional duty of performing the functions of a Presidential Electoral Tribunal, Congress has not, through Republic Act No. 1793, encroached upon the appointing power of the Executive. The imposition of new duties constitutes, neither the creation of an office, nor the appointment of an officer. 
29


In view of a resolution of this Court dated July 8, 1966, upholding the validity of Republic Act No. 1793, upon the ground that it merely vests additional jurisdiction in the Supreme Court, petitioner has filed a motion dated July 13, 1966, praying this Court ""to clarify whether or not"" this ""election contest should as a consequence ... be docketed with, and the records thereof transferred, to this Supreme Court, and all pleadings, papers and processes relative thereto should thence forth be filed with it"". The motion is, evidently, based upon the premise that the Supreme Court is different and distinct from the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, which is erroneous, as well as contrary to the ruling made in said resolution.


Wherefore, the petition herein is hereby dismissed and the writs therein prayed for denied accordingly. The aforesaid motion is, moreover, denied. With costs against the petitioner. It is so ordered.

See, for instance, Sec. 2. Act 496 (Land Registration Act), Sec. 14, Act 1956 (Insolvency jaw), and Sec. 8, CA 473 (Revised Naturalization Law), which confer upon courts of first instance additional original jurisdiction.

The Courts Of First Instance function not only as 
Courts of General Jurisdiction
, i.e., competent to decide all cases, civil and criminal, within their own jurisdiction (12 CJS 20-21, I Moran xxxiii; Rep. Act 296. Secs. 39, 44) but also as 
Courts of Special Jurisdiction
, empowered to decide certain

 matters, such as 
probate, admiralty, naturalization, bankruptcy, cadastral
 and land

 cases.

The powers and functions of the 
Court of Land Registration

11
Aside from performing the functions of a
 probate
 court (Sec. 44, par. [e], Republic Act 296, as amended), courts of first instance also act as 
admiralty courts
 (Sec. 44[d], Republic Act 296), 
bankruptcy courts
 (Act 1956), and as 
courts of juvenile and domestic relations
 (Republic Act No. 1401, Sec. 1).

cadastral
 or 
land registration
 cases covering lots where there is no controversy or opposition, or contested lots the value of which does not exceed ten thousand pesos, x x x ."" Also, said municipal and city judges, ""in the absence of the District Judge from the province, may exercise within the province 
like
 interlocutory jurisdiction as the Court of First Instance, which shall be held to include the hearing of all motions for the appointment of a receiver, for temporary injunctions, and for all other orders of the court which are not final in their character and do not involve a decision of the case on its merits, and the hearing of petitions for a writ of 
habeas corpus
."" 
Sec. 87, Republic Act 296
 confers upon municipal judges in the capitals of provinces and sub-provinces and judges of city courts 
like
 jurisdiction as the Court of First Instance to try parties charged with an offense committed within their respective jurisdictions, in which the penalty provided by law does not exceed
 prision correccional
 or imprisonment for not more than six years or fine not exceeding six thousand pesos or both, and in the absence of the district judge, like jurisdiction within the province as the Court of First Instance to hear application for bail.


14
In addition to the 
original
 and the 
appellate
 jurisdictions conferred upon the Supreme Court by the Constitution (Art. VIII, Sec. 2), Republic Act 296, Sec. 17 vests it with

The imposition by the legislature to a constitutional body of additional duties not inconsistent with those already prescribed by the Constitution is a practice recognized in many jurisdiction. See, 42 Am. Jur. Public Officers, Secs. 31, 9, pp. 902, 1949; State vs. Caldwell, 23 So. 2d 855, Terrell, J., Supreme Court of Florida; Rouse vs. Johnson, 28 S.W. (2d) 745, 70 A.L.R. 1077, CA Kentucky (1930). Even this Court has recognized the authority of the Legislature

""In the United States, except for such offices as are created by Constitution, the creation of public offices is primarily a legislative function.
