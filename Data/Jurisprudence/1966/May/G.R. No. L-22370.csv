G.R. No. L-22370             May 27, 1966


LILIA HERNAEZ,
 plaintiff and appellant,

vs.


YAN KAO,
 defendant and appellee.


R. C. Salvador for plaintiff and appellant.

Leandro C. Delante and Orellano for defendant and appellee.


SANCHEZ, 
J.:


Suits originally started in the City Court of Davao City. There, on April 27, 1963, plaintiff — a former salesgirl in defendant's Centro de Modas Tailoring — lodged her complaint
1
 for unpaid wages, differential pay, premium pay and overtime pay, amounting to P1,641.90.
2


Plaintiff's complaint was met with defendant's motion to dismiss filed on May 18, 1963 upon the ground of release.
3
 This motion to dismiss brings to the fore another proceeding before the Department of Labor, Regional Office No. XII, where plaintiff first filed her complaint in February, 1963 against the same defendant, doing business under the name and style of Centro de Modas Tailoring, covering the same cause of action set forth in plaintiff's complaint, namely: non-payment of wages, differential pay, premium pay, and overtime pay. That proceeding ended in an amicable settlement between the parties set forth in an ""Affidavit of Release"" dated February 26, 1963 and executed by plaintiff before Bernardo G. Delfin, Labor Attorney.
4


On June 26, 1963, the City Court, over plaintiff's objection, granted the motion and dismissed plaintiff's case.
1äwphï1.ñët


Plaintiff thereafter elevated the case to the Court of First Instance of Davao.
5


On October 3, 1963 the Court of First Instance of Davao after a review of the record elevated from the City Court — similarly dismissed plaintiff's case upon the same ground of release.
6


The present is an appeal registered on November 6, 1963 from the foregoing order of October 3, 1963, ""on purely a question of law"".
7


We focus attention on plaintiff's Affidavit of Release, which reads:




I, LILIA HERNAEZ of legal age, married and a resident of Bonifacio Street, Davao City, after having been duly sworn in accordance with law, hereby depose and say:


That I am the same Lilia Hernaez who filed a complaint with the Department of Labor, Davao City, against the Centro de Modas Tailoring for non-payment of wages, differential pay, premium pay and overtime pay and separation pay;


That acting upon my said claim, Atty. Bernardo G. Delfin, Labor Attorney, set a conference between me and the one against whom I have filed my complaint;


That during the conference, the Centro de Modas, represented by Miss Fely Yan, and I 
have agreed to settle the same amicably
;


That during the amicable settlement, 
I was paid all my claims
 against the Centro de Modas, through Atty. Delfin;


That by virtue of the said 
amicable settlement to my full satisfaction
, I am executing this affidavit for the purpose of informing all and sundry of our said settlement.
8




For, indeed, the dismissals both in the City Court and in the Court of First Instance are anchored exclusively on the value given the foregoing affidavit.


Plaintiff's complaint seeks relief for nonpayment of wages, differential pay, premium pay and overtime pay. The release likewise covers the very same claim of plaintiff for non-payment of wages, differential pay, premium pay and overtime pay. Concretely, the claim before the courts and the previous one before the Department of Labor, refer exactly to the same cause of action. That claim was amicably settled. The affidavit recites that plaintiff was paid all her claims against the Centro de Modas Tailoring thru Labor Attorney Bernardo G. Delfin.


Plaintiff does not impugn the genuineness and due execution of the affidavit of release she subscribed and swore to. There is no intimation that fraud, threat or intimidation vitiated that document. There is no charge that the settlement was executed through mistake or undue influence. It was voluntary; more, it was to her 
full
 satisfaction. The amicable settlement entered into is valid and binding.
9
 The law looks at compromise with favor. 
10


But plaintiff seeks to downgrade the legal effects of the release. She puts forward the averment that it amounts to a waiver of her claims for compensation and defeats the provisions of Commonwealth Acts 303 and 444. 
11
 Plaintiff is laboring under a misconception. Waiver ""is the intentional relinquishment of a known right"". 
12
 Here, there is no such known right. Nothing in the record suggests that plaintiff's claim had ever been fully established or liquidated in the Department of Labor. There simply was a compromise, an amicable settlement. 
13
 Said compromise is valid and binding, ""not because it is the settlement of a valid claim, but because it is the settlement of a controversy"" 
14
 brought to the labor Department. And, compromise is a ground for a motion to dismiss. 
15


The issue here raised is by no means untrodden ground. In 1956, in the Mercader case, 
16
 this Court was at grips with a similar problem. Plaintiff therein was employed by the Manila Polo Club as a bookkeeper and accountant. His services having been terminated, plaintiff lodged a claim for P10,000.00 in the Department of Labor. The proceedings there ended with plaintiff signing the receipt (Exhibit 1) for P7,000.00 ""in full settlement of any and all claims, including overtime work, vacation and sick leave privileges, which said Alejandro Mercader has or may have against the Manila Polo Club."" This notwithstanding, plaintiff sued defendant in court praying for P5,000.00 by way of actual and compensatory damages; P50,000.00, moral damages; P2,000.00, attorneys' fees; and P200.00, litigation expenses. This Court there held that ""by virtue of said settlement, plaintiff lost any action against the defendant Manila Polo Club in connection with his employment and separation from said club."" 
17
 Paraphrasing the opinion of this court in a labor case, 
18
 the 
compromise
 now before us has the force of law between plaintiff and defendant, and may not be unilaterally jettisoned by plaintiff, one of the parties thereto.


Upon the premises, the order of October 3, 1963 appealed from should be, as it is, hereby affirmed. No costs allowed. 
19
 So ordered.
