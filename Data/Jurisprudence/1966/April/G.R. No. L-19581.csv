IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF SUSANO SY TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. 
SUSANO SY,
 petitioner-appellee,

vs.


REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES,
 oppositor-appellant.


Gamiano M. Eleccion, for petitioner-appellee.

Office of the Solicitor General Arturo A. Alafriz, Assistant Solicitor General Pacifico P. de Castro and Solicitor F. J. Bautista, for the oppositor-appellant.


BENGZON, 
C.J.:


The Republic has appealed the decision of the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental granting the petition for naturalization of Susano Sy. It maintains that said petitioner does not possess 
all 
the qualifications required by law.


The record shows that for the years preceding his petition (1958, 1959, 1960 and 1961),
1
 Susano Sy's average annual income was only P3,000.00. Under our recent rulings, he does not have a ""lucrative"" trade or occupation, and may not be admitted to Philippine citizenship.
