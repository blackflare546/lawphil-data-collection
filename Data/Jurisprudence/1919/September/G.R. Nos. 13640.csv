JOHNSON, 
J.:


A petition for the writ of 
habeas corpus
 was presented  to the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila on the  28th day of December, 1917. Upon a consideration of the  facts the Honorable George R. Harvey, judge, granted the  petition and ordered the petitioner discharged from the  custody of the law. From the decision the Attorney-General  appealed.   


The Attorney-General alleges that the lower court committed  an error ""in reversing the decision of the respondent  and in permitting the petitioner to enter the Philippine  Islands as the minor son of a resident Chinese merchant.""  The Attorney-General, in concluding his brief, says: ""The  decision of the lower court, appearing to be 
based upon  sound reasoning and good judgment,
 but appearing to provide  limitations to several decisions of this court, is respectfully  submitted so that this court may, if it see fit, either  approve or reject the principles enunciated therein.   


The facts, as they are disclosed by the record, may be  stated as follows:   


1.	That on the 10th day of November, 1917, the appellee,  Dy Keng, arrived at the port of Manila on the steamship  
Yuengsang,
 and asked permission to land in the Philippine  Islands as the minor son of one Dy Soco, a resident merchant  in the Philippine Islands.   


2.	An examination was held by the board of special inquiry  of the Department of Customs and several witnesses  were examined upon the question of the right of the said  Dy Keng to enter the Philippine Islands.   


3.	An examination of the record shows that the only  question presented to the board of special inquiry was that  relating to the age of the appellee — whether he was a minor  or not.   


4.	That five witnesses were presented to the board of  special inquiry; that each of said witnesses, including the  appellee and his father, swore positively and apparently  without reservation or attempted evasion, that the appellee  was about 20 years of age. No proof whatever was adduced  disputing or even tending to dispute the positive  statements of each of said witnesses.   


5.	That at the close of the examination and after hearing  each of said witnesses, the board of special inquiry in  its decision stated: ""Considering the personal appearance  of the applicant who seems to be of between 22 and 25  years, the Board believes that he is not a minor son as he  alleges,"" and refused the appellee, upon that ground alone,  the right to enter the Philippine Islands, and ordered him  deported.   


6.	That an appeal was taken from the board of special  inquiry to the Collector of Customs. The Collector of Customs  dismissed the appeal for the following reason in the  following language: ""The decision of the Board of Special  Inquiry that this applicant had no right to land in the  Philippine Islands as the legitimate minor son of a resident  Chinese merchant, being fully sustained by the examination  made by officers of the United States Public Health Service  at the port of Manila who found said applicant to be very  close to and probably over 21 years of age.""   


7.	That the appellee, upon being informed of the decision  of the Collector of Customs, presented a petition  for the writ of 
habeas corpus
 in the Court of First Instance,  which petition, upon a consideration, was duly granted by  the lower court, and the Attorney-General appealed.   


From the examination of the decision of the board of  special inquiry it will be found that it denied the appellee  the right to enter the Philippine Islands solely upon the  ground that from his 
personal appearance
 he seemed to be  between 22 and 25 years of age; while the Collector of  Customs confirmed the decision of the board of special inquiry  because its finding had been sustained by officers of  the United States Public Health Service. An examination  of the record fails to disclose in any manner whatever any  proof, or even a semblance of proof, showing or indicating  in the slightest degree what the ""personal appearance""  of the appellee which caused the board of special inquiry  of the officers of the United States Public Health Service  to believe that the appellee was a person more than twenty-one  years of age; and, moreover, there is nothing in the  record, to show that the appellee ever saw, or ever knew,  or ever had an opportunity to examine or to cross-examine  the ""Officers of the United States Public Health Service""  relating to his particular appearance which induced said  officers to believe that was ""probably over 21 years of  age.""   


While the courts have held in numerous cases that the  age of persons may be determined be their personal appearance,  yet at the same time they have always insisted,  when the question was raised, that the deciding officer or  court should cause the record to show, not be a 
general
  statement that the ""personal appearance"" induced the officer  or court to believe that the person in question was of  a particular age but 
the particular fact or facts
 concerning  the ""personal appearance"" which led said officer or court to  believe that his age was as said officer or court stated.   


The important reason for this rule is, that in case of  an appeal, the appellate court may have before it all of the  facts and circumstances which influenced or controled the  officer or court in its conclusions; and further, in order  that the appellate court may see that the officer or court  deciding the question had some reasonable basis for the  conclusions, to the end that capricious and unfounded judgments  affecting the rights of persons may not be promulgated.   


The question before us has come before the courts many  times. In fixing the penalty, in cases of rape, in questions  of legitimacy, when intoxicating liquors are sold to alleged  minors, abduction of minors, in cases of inheritance, when  two persons die at the same time, and in many other cases,  the age of persons becomes of paramount importance and  the method of determining it has caused the courts no end  of vexation.   


In many cases, as indicated above, the age of a person is  the most important fact to be determined in order to arrive  at a just and legal conclusion. And many times the only  proof available is the ""personal appearance"" of the person  in question.  


It may be argued, in answer to the requirement, that the  officer or court who fixes the age by the mere ""personal  appearance"" cannot put into the record the particular fact  or facts upon which he basis his conclusion. In reply to  that arguments, it may be said that if there are no particular  facts upon which the judgment can be based, certainly no  judgment should be rendered upon that question. All persons  are constantly estimating the age of others, and if they  should be asked in each particular case for the basis of  their conclusion, they would always have some particular  fact or facts upon which they bases their conclusion. Officers  and courts whose duty it is to as certain the facts and reach  conclusions will have no difficulty in stating the particular  facts upon which they base their conclusions, if their conclusions  are honest and not capricious. For example, an  examination of the teeth of human beings is one of the  methods by which their age may be approximately estimated;  their general appearance, wrinkles in the face, the  color of the hair, the general appearance as to maturity,  and many other specific facts may be given upon which  age may be more or less definitely fixed.   


Judgments and sentences of persons or courts acting in  a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity must be based upon  proof adduced and not upon opinion, when a question of  fact is presented. Mere opinions do not constitute facts.  The opinion of a witness as to what are the facts is not a  fact. It is true that the opinion of experts are sometimes  allowed when they relate to specific or hypothetical facts;  but in such a case the court on appeal has before it the  specific facts and may draw its own conclusion. When  the court has nothing but the opinion of the witness it has  nothing before it upon which to base its conclusions. The  opinion may be a mere whim or caprice, based wholly upon  the desires of the witness. Of course, after the witness has  given the particular facts he may then give his opinion in  certain classes of cases.   


A mere opinion or suspicion cannot give probative force  to testimony which in itself is insufficient to establish or  to justify an inference of a particular fact. When an officer  or court allows itself to enter upon the sea of suspicion,  it permits itself to enter upon a sea which has no shore,  and the embarkation is without a rudder or compass to  control the direction or to ascertain its bearing.   


To permits courts or persons acting in a judicial capacity,  who have been given authority to decide questions of fact,  to decide the same upon the mere whims or caprices of  witnesses would permit them to resort to the miserable, unjust,  and sometimes cowardly, expedient of attempting to  hide the real facts under findings which rest upon nothing  but their own desire to grasp power and to do violence to  the rights of others, which they cannot otherwise do if they  are required to make a finding of facts based upon evidence  actually presented. Intellectual dishonestly should never be  permitted to confer either jurisdiction or power upon any  official, and, when power thus acquired is attempted to be  used to another's hurt, the appellate courts should be alert  to halt it.   


From all of the foregoing, our conclusions are: (1) that  there is no evidence in the record to support the conclusions  of the Department of Customs; (2) all of the evidence  adduced shows, without contradiction, that the appellee was  a minor son of a resident Chinese merchant; and (3) there  being no evidence in the record to support the conclusions  of the Department of Customs, that fact constituted an  abuse of authority.  


Therefore, the judgment of the Court of First Instance  is hereby affirmed; and, without any finding as to costs,  it is so ordered.
