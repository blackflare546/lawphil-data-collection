MOIR, 
J.:


This case is before the court on appeal by plaintiffs from  a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Occidental  Negros, Honorable Norberto Romualdez, judge.    


For a better understanding of the facts the history of  the case is given. 


Francisco Caponong died in October, 1906, owing the  plaintiffs a sum of money which was then less than the  amount allowed by the commissioners.    


His widow, Felicisima Abada, was appointed administratrix  of the estate, commissioners to appraise the estate and  to pass on the claims against the estate were duly appointed,  and plaintiffs presented their claim which was allowed by  the commissioners in the sum of 
P12,783.74
. The commissioner's  report was dated in February, 1909.    


The administratrix leased the 
hacienda
 [farm] known  as 
""Coronacion""
 to Hilario Zayco for a term of years, but  afterwards she married Vicente Alvarez, one of the defendants,  and the lease was transferred to Alvarez by Zayco,  October 2, 1908.    


On the 11th of April, 1913, nearly seven years after the  death of Caponong, the plaintiffs herein filed a suit in the  Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros against Felicisima  Abada personally and as administratrix of the estate  of Francisco Caponong, alleging that Francisco Caponong  owed plaintiffs P12,783.74, and that Felicisima Abada in her  own name and as administratrix, had been receiving from  the plaintiffs money and effects from 1908 to 1912 which  money and effects were used by the defendant in ""the expense  of cultivation and the exploitation of the Hacienda  '
Coronacion,
' ""and that defendant had delivered to plaintiffs  the sugar produced until the last crop which she refused  to deliver to them. And that due to 
""los contratiempos  agricolas y a la poca produccion de la hacienda
 [drought and  poor crops of the farm],' and after deducting for the sugar  delivered, the account of the defendant showed a balance  in favor of plaintiffs on the 27th of August, 1912, of  P62,437.15; that of this amount they were informed the  defendant recognized as due from the estate only ""about  P14,000"" which however had not been paid; that it had  been agreed by Francisco Caponong that the ""amounts""  taken should draw interest at the rate of 12 per cent from  the date of each, and that in case it was necessary to bring  suit P1,500 would be paid by defendant to plaintiffs for their  expenses and attorney's fees, and they asked for judgment  for P62,437.15 with interest at 12 per cent and P1,500 for  attorney's fee.    


A copy of the account of the administratrix, dated August  27, 1912, showing the same balance due plaintiffs, seems to  have been filed with that suit.    


The defendant's answer in that case (No. 969, Neg. Occi.)  admits she owed P8,555.78 as administratrix, and alleges  that the balance was due by her personally.    


The guardian of the minor children of Francisco Caponong  asked permission of the court to intervene in that  suit, and this being granted, he denied the claim under oath,  and alleged that the estate of Francisco Caponong did not  owe plaintiffs anything.    


On the 25th of August, 1914, the parties, including the  guardian of the minors, presented a motion in court stating  that they had made an amicable settlement of the litigation,  and prayed the court to dismiss the action, which was done.    


The record shows that the plaintiffs in that suit had a  motion pending in the intestate proceedings of Francisco  Caponong, petitioning the court to the same effect as the  complaint in suit No. 969.    


The settlement agreed upon was, briefly, that the defendants,  including the guardian of the minor children, ""recognized  that the deceased Francisco Caponong's estate was  indebted to the plaintiffs, according to a liquidation of the  accounts on the 30th of June, 1913, in the sum of P68,611.01,  which was to be paid with 10 per cent interest in seven  equal annual installments;"" and to secure this debt, the  defendants agreed to give plaintiffs a first mortgage on all  the property of Francisco Caponong, except the growing  sugar cane, and on all the property belonging exclusively to Felicisima Abada, and the defendants agreed to secure judicial approval of the settlement. The defendants also agreed to mortgage the carabaos then on the hacienda to plaintiffs.  


The contract is dated the 27th of April, 1914.    


The mortgage of the hacienda was duly executed by Felicisima  Abada for herself and as administratrix, and the  guardian of the children and Vicente Alvarez, the husband  of Felicisima Abada, signed the mortgage which is also  dated the 27th of April, 1914. The carabaos were not mortgaged.    


The compromise was approved by the court as well as  the mortgage.    


The mortgage given was not recorded in the registry  of property up to time of the institution of this suit,  June 24, 1916.    


Coming now to the present action, the plaintiffs allege  in the complaint in this suit, the former suit and its settlement  with judicial approval; the amount due thereunder;  
i. e.,
 P68,611.01; that defendants had let two installments  go by without paying anything; that the amount  due them with accrued interest was P90,383.49; that besides  the property mortgaged, as per Exhibit B, another  parcel of land was mortgaged, and that defendants promised  to mortgage the carabaos on the hacienda 
'Coronacion,""
  and that this promise was one of the motives and  considerations including the plaintiffs to accept the compromise  agreement, but that defendants refused to sign  the agreement mortgaging the carabaos with the object  and intent of reducing the security of plaintiffs; that  defendants were about to transfer their property not mortgaged,  and they prayed for an attachment on property  of defendants not to exceed P20,000 in value, and for  judgment for P90, 383.49 with interest, and that if this  amount should not be paid that the mortgaged property  be sold, and if not sufficient to pay the debts, that the  property levied on under the attachment be sold.    


The court granted the attachment order the 24th of  July, 1916, and the provincial sheriff attached one parcel of  land, the growing crops, certain products of the soil, and various  animals.    


On the 16th of February, 1917, the plaintiffs filed a  motion in court alleging that the property mortgaged to secure their debt was not sufficient to secure the debt;  that defendants, with the intention of prejudicing the interest  of the plaintiffs, were negligent in the conservation  and care of the property, and they asked the court to  appoint a receiver for the property that was 
mortgaged.
  The court granted this motion on the 20th of February,  1917, as to all the property 
attached,
 and on the 26th of  February, extended the receivership to all the 
mortgaged
  property.    


The receiver took charge of the property and the defendants  were ousted from the house they had been 
occupying
  on the premises.    


The defendants, Felicisima Abada, administratrix, and  Januario Granada, the guardian, filed an amended answer  in which they allege their representative capacity; that the  claim of the plaintiffs against the intestate proceedings of  Francisco Caponong had been allowed in the sum of  P12,783.74 by the commissioners; that the property belonged  to the children of the deceased; that the only interest  of Felicisima Abada personally was her usufructuary  interest in one-sixth of the property; that all the  property was in 
custodia legis,
 and could not lawfully be  attached; that the administratrix had not contracted any  other obligation, and that, if any existed, it was the personal  debt of her present husband, Vicente Alvarez; that  Exhibits A and B, (the compromise agreement and the  mortgage executed in conformity therewith) made a part  of the complaint, were obtained through fraud and false  representation; that the approval of the court was obtained  through fraud and deceit, and was illegal and of no value;  that defendants have never attempted to sell or conceal  their property, and prayed the court to declare Exhibits  A and B null and void; and that the attachment was  malicious and illegal, and they presented a counterclaim  based on the wrongful issuance, on false affidavits of the  attachment, laying their damages in the sum of P89,960  for which they asked judgment. And a second counterclaim  was presented based on the unwarranted appointment  of a receiver for property already in custody of the court,  through the administratrix and they alleged their damages  in this count in the sum of P28,120.    


The Honorable Norberto Romualdez, judge, in his decision  largely sustained defendants' claim, and declared that  plaintiffs should pay as damages    






For improperly causing the appointment of a receiver




P 500.00






For the attachment of carabaos, etc




500.00






For damages to the sugar because of the attachment and the appointment of a receiver




4,462.50






For damages to land by reason of being left to grow up in bushes




5,000.00






For damages to palay crop




2,800.00








13,262.50








A further sum of P1,000 damages was awarded to Felicisima  Abada for having been put out of her house when  the receiver was appointed.    


The attachment was dissolved and the receiver discharged,  and he was ordered to return the property to defendants.    


Judgment was given for the plaintiffs to recover from  defendant administratrix the sum of P8,555.78 with interest  which, added to the principal, brought the amount to  P11,392.99 with 10 per cent interest on that sum till paid.    


A personal judgment was also given plaintiffs against  the defendants Abada and Alvarez for P79,970.21.    


The plaintiffs' claim against the guardian of the children  was dismissed.    


From this judgment Felicisima Abada appealed personally  and as administratrix alleging that the trial court  should have granted greater damages. The questions presented  by her appeal will be sufficiently treated in the appeal of plaintiffs.    


The plaintiffs allege nineteen different errors of the  trial court. It seems that all the questions are involved in  errors Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 12, 13 and 18, which are as follows:    


1.	The court erred in holding that the obligation set  forth in Exhibits A and B should be understood as limited  to the sum of P8,555.78, instead of the sum of P68, 611.01  therein stated.    


2.	The court erred in reducing the amount of the mortgage,  Exhibit B, from P68,611.01 to P8,555,78.    


4.	The court erred in finding that just and sufficient  grounds did not exist for the attachment of the properties  which are the subject-matter of this action.    


5.	The court erred in finding that just and sufficient  grounds did not exist for the appointment of a receiver  for the properties which are the subject-matter of this action.    


10.	The court erred in finding that the defendants, or  either or any of them, were damaged in the sum of  P5,000 by reason of injury to the sugar lands which are  the subject-matter of this action.    


12.	The court erred in declining and refusing to foreclose  the mortgages which are the subject-matter of the  present action.    


13.	The court erred in reducing the indebtedness of the  Estate of Francisco Caponong from P90,383.49 to  P11,392.99.    


18.	The court erred in absolving from the complaint  herein the defendant Januario Granada as guardian of  the minors, Juan Buenaventura, Jose, Nicanor and Carlos  Caponong y Abada.


 As to the first error
. — Exhibit A was the compromise  agreement made in action No. 969, Lizarraga Hermanos  against Felicisima Abada personally and as administratrix,  in which the guardian of the minor children intervened,  as defendant, by permission of the court. Exhibit  B was the mortgage given to secure the amount agreed  upon in that settlement.    


The claim of the plaintiffs herein against the estate of  Francisco Caponong had been fixed by the commissioners.  The amount so determined was all the estate owed plaintiffs.  The court says in its decision that in approving the  settlement of action No. 969, its approval was meant to include only the amount actually due by the estate, and  that the balance of the claim was intended to be approved  as against Felicisima Abada personally.    


It is argued that ""this is sheer and unequivocal repudiation  of a solemn and formal act"" of the court.    


The record in case No. 969 is presented as Exhibit C by  plaintiffs. In their complaint in that action (which suit  should never have been filed as all the property was in  the custody of the court), plaintiffs allege that their  original claim against the estate of Francisco Caponong  was only P12,783.74, and that the balance of the claim  was due from Felicisima Abada as 
administratrix and  personally
 without stating how much was owed by her  personally and how much was owed by her as administratrix.    


Whether the court in approving the compromise intended  to hold the 
defendant estate 
liable only for the original  debt, and 
defendant Abada
 for the balance, is not material.  The language used by the court is very clear and  seems to be an outright approval of the 
""transaccion""
  (compromise), and would, so far as the language goes,  leave no room for doubt of the court's approval of the agreement  in full and as written.    


But could the court approve such an agreement? Could  the court authorize a mortgage of the state?    


The law declares that commissioners shall pass upon all  claims against the estate. They had done so in this case. The law fixed the limit of the estate's liability. The court  could not charge it with debts that were never owed by  it. The administratrix could only charge the estate with  the reasonable and proper expenses of administration.    


The estate owed plaintiffs less than P13,000 when the  commissioners passed on their claim. Part of this has  been paid, and there was a balance due plaintiffs of  P8,555.78 at the time of the trial, plus interest. The plaintiffs,  after their claim had been presented and allowed by  the commissioners, made advances to the administratrix  till their claim was more than P68,000.    


It is urged that the major part of this debt of P68,000  is 
administration expenses
, and as such is chargeable against  the assets of the estate. No reason is given why the expense  of administration should be so great, and the evidence  fails to sustain this position.    


The administration expense would be the necessary expenses  of handling the property, of protecting it against  destruction or deterioration, and possibly producing a crop,  but if plaintiffs, holding a claim originally for less than  P13,000 against the estate, let the administratrix have  money and effects till their claim grow to P68,000 they  can not be permitted to charge this amount as 
expense of  administration.
 They might be allowed to charge it  against the current revenue from the hacienda or the  net proceeds of the ""exploitation of the hacienda"" for which  it was obtained and used, as plaintiffs allege, but it cannot  relate back to the presenting of their claim to the  commissioners, and be a charge against the inheritance  of the heirs, or even a claim to prorate with other creditors'  claims allowed by the commissioners. By expense of  administration we understand to be the reasonable and  necessary expense of caring for the property and managing  it till the debts are paid, as provided by law, and of dividing  it, if necessary, so as to partition it and deliver to the  heirs.    


The court could not approve a settlement saddling upon  the estate debts it never owed, and if it did, its approval  would be a nullity.    


To give effect to the compromise as written would result  in great wrong, and destroy every chance the minor children  had to participate in the inheritance of their father.    


The contract was clearly a dead letter, and the approval  of the court could not breathe the breath of life into it.    


That the mortgage given at the same time and as a  result of the agreement was without legal warrant is equally  clear. No mortgage can be placed by an administrator on  the estate of a descendant, unless it is specifically authorized  by statute.    


There is no statute in the Philippine Islands authorizing  it.    


It may be stated as a general proposition, that neither  executors, unless specially authorized by will, nor administrators,  have the power to bind the estate of the deceased  by borrowing money. (The American Law of Administration,  Woerner, Vol. 2, sec. 345.)    


In the case of Johnson 
vs
. Davidson, the Supreme Court  of Illinois (Vol. 162, at page 235) said:    


The argument on behalf of appellants seems to proceed  upon the supposition that an administrator may bind the  heirs by his mortgage of real estate for the purpose of  raising money with which to pay the debts of the ancestors,  and that a court of equity will sustain the mortgage, or a  title derived under it, if it be shown that the borrowed money  was honestly applied to the payment of debts. No  
authority is cited in support of this position, and none, we  believe, can be found.
 (
See also 
Smith
 vs
. Hutchinson, 108  Ill., at p. 668.)    


In the case of Black
 vs.
 Dressel's Heirs, the Supreme  Court of Kansas (Vol. 20, at page 154) said:    


. . . That the statute grants no power to an administrator  to borrow money upon a mortgage of the real  estate of the decedent, is not controverted. Indeed, such an  act is foreign to the policy and purpose of administration,  which aims to close up, not to continue an estate. . . .    


In 151 N. Y. Reports, Duryea
 vs.
 Mackey
,
 it is said at  p. 207:    


The mortgage executed by the temporary administrator  in this case which purported to bind the whole estate, was  therefore ineffectual to charge the interest of the devises  in remainder, unless the order of the surrogate authorizing  the mortgage was a lawful exercise of his jurisdiction or  unless they have estopped themselves from questioning its  validity. 
It is very clear that the order of the surrogate  was without jurisdiction.   
 


The learned counsels for appellants in their brief do not  cite a single authority for the placing of a mortgage on an  estate in administration, and none has been found. It must  be held that the mortgage was void.    


The court should have closed up the estate.    


So many courts seem to violate the law on this point  that it may serve a useful purpose to call attention to our  statutes on the subject of estates.    


Section 743 of the Code of Civil Procedure declares:    


The court, at the time of granting letters testamentary  or of administration, shall allow to the executor or administrator  a time for disposing of the estate and paying the  debts and legacies of the deceased person, which time shall  not, in the first instance, exceed one year; but the court  
may,
 on application of the executor or administrator, from  time to time, as the circumstances of the estate require,  extend the time not exceeding six months at a time, nor  so that the whole time allowed to the original executor or  administrator shall exceed 
three years
.    


Section 745 provides that if the executor or administrator  dies, the new administrator appointed shall give the same  notice for an extension of time which shall not exceed  six months beyond the time which might have been allowed  the first administrator.    


While these sections may be considered as only directory,  all Courts of First Instance should exert themselves to close  up estates within twelve months from the time they are  presented, and they may refuse to allow any compensation  to executors and administrators who do not actively labor  to that end, and they may even adopt harsher measures.    


The second assignment of error is that the court should  not have reduced the amount of the mortgage (Exhibit B)  from P68,611.01 to P8,555.78. The court did err, but its  error consisted in not declaring the mortgage void.    


The court was without jurisdiction to approve the mortgage  in the first place, and its approval was a nullity.  Plaintiff's claim against the estate was P8,555.78 with interest  as added by the court. This claim should be paid 
 pro rata 
with any other unpaid claims against the estate.    


The other errors of appellant need only brief consideration.    


That an attachment should not have been levied on the  carabaos in administration is too plain to need discussion.  If they were in the name and possession of the administratrix,  they were in 
custodia legis,
 and could not be lawfully  attached. The plaintiffs as creditors of the estate  could have petitioned the court to compel the administratrix  to take any steps necessary and proper to protect the interest  of all concerned.    


The appointment of a receiver was equally unjustified  and improper. The property being under the court's control,  the court should have removed the administratrix, if  necessary, and it could have taken other means to protect  the creditors and wind up the estate.    


The plaintiffs assign as error No. 10 that the court  should not have allowed the sum of P5,000 damages for  injury to the sugar lands.    


The evidence as to this damage is not considered as clear and satisfactory as it should be.    


It seems this claim should have been wholly denied by the  trial court, and we think the judgment in favor of the administratrix  and against the plaintiffs should be reduced  from P13,262.50 to P8,262.50 with interest as provided  therein. The other damages allowed by the trial court are  so fully sustained by the evidence, it is not necessary to  discuss them.    


With the above modification and with a declaration that  the mortgage, exhibit B, was absolutely void, the judgment  appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.  So ordered.
