CALLEJO, SR., 
J.:


Before us is a petition for review on certiorari of the Decision
1
 and the Resolution
2
 of respondent Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 44883. 


The Case for the Petitioner


Respondents Angelica Tiotuyco Vda. de Lacson,
3
 and her children Amancia, Antonio, Juan, and Teodosia, all surnamed Lacson, were the registered owners of three parcels of land located in Mabalacat, Pampanga, covered by Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) Nos. 35922-R, 35923-R, and 35925-R, registered in the Register of Deeds of San Fernando, Pampanga. The properties, which were tenanted agricultural lands,
4
 were administered by Renato Espinosa for the owner.


On March 17, 1996, a group of original farmers/tillers, namely, Julio Tiamson, Renato Gozun, Rosita Hernandez, Bienvenido Tongol, Alfonso Flores, Norma Quiambao, Rosita Tolentino, Jose Sosa, Francisco Tolentino, Sr., Emiliano Laxamana, Ruben Torres, Meliton Allanigue, Dominga Laxamana, Felicencia de Leon, Emiliano Ramos, and another group, namely, Felino G. Tolentino, Rica Gozun, Perla Gozun, Benigno Tolentino, Rodolfo Quiambao, Roman Laxamana, Eddie San Luis, Ricardo Hernandez, Nicenciana Miranda, Jose Gozun, Alfredo Sosa, Jose Tiamson, Augusto Tolentino, Sixto Hernandez, Alex Quiambao, Isidro Tolentino, Ceferino de Leon, Alberto Hernandez, Orlando Flores, and Aurelio Flores,
5
 individually executed in favor of the petitioner separate Deeds of Assignment
6
 in which the assignees assigned to the petitioner their respective rights as tenants/tillers of the landholdings possessed and tilled by  them for and in consideration of P50.00 per square meter.  The said amount was made payable ""when the legal impediments to the sale of the property to the petitioner no longer existed.""  The petitioner was also granted the exclusive right to buy the property if and when the respondents, with the concurrence of the defendants-tenants, agreed to sell the property.  In the interim, the petitioner gave varied sums of money to the tenants as partial payments, and the latter issued receipts for the said amounts.


On July 24, 1996, the petitioner called a meeting of the defendants-tenants to work out the implementation of the terms of their separate agreements.
7
 However, on August 8, 1996, the defendants-tenants, through Joven Mariano, wrote the petitioner stating that they were not attending the meeting and instead gave notice of their collective decision to sell all their rights and interests, as tenants/lessees, over the landholding to the respondents.
8
 Explaining their reasons for their collective decision, they wrote as follows:


Kami ay nagtiwala sa inyo, naging tapat at nanindigan sa lahat ng ating napagkasunduan, hindi tumanggap ng ibang buyer o ahente, pero sinira ninyo  ang aming pagtitiwala sa pamamagitan  ng demanda ninyo at pagbibigay ng problema sa amin na hindi naman nagbenta ng lupa.


Kaya kami ay nagpulong at nagpasya na ibenta na lang ang aming karapatan o ang aming lupang sinasaka sa landowner o sa mga pamilyang Lacson, dahil ayaw naming magkaroon ng problema.


Kaya kung ang sasabihin ninyong ito’y katangahan, lalo sigurong magiging katangahan kung ibebenta pa namin sa inyo ang aming lupang sinasaka, kaya  pasensya na lang Mister Tayag. Dahil sinira ninyo ang aming pagtitiwala at katapatan.

On August 19, 1996, the petitioner filed a complaint with the Regional Trial Court of San Fernando, Pampanga, Branch 44, against the defendants-tenants, as well as the respondents, for the court to fix a period within which to pay the agreed purchase price of P50.00 per square meter to the defendants, as provided for in the Deeds of Assignment.  The petitioner also prayed for a writ of preliminary injunction against the defendants and the respondents therein.
10
 The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 10910.


In his complaint, the petitioner alleged, inter alia, the following:
