ARNEL GABRIEL,
 petitioner,

vs.


COURT OF APPEALS and PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
 respondents.


D E C I S I O N


TINGA, 
J.:


The automobile has probably, directly or indirectly, caused more litigation than any other material objective of human endeavor in a corresponding period of time and even more so since its invention.
1
 This Court, on occasion, is constrained to determine how and why particular motor vehicle accidents happen and whether the persons responsible are criminally liable. The applicable standards for vehicular accident cases have long been settled by jurisprudence and the correct application of such standards invariably hinges on the particular facts involved.
2
 The Court’s review though should by no means be perfunctory as the liberty of the accused is at stake. 


The case emanates from a three-way vehicular collision on the night of 19 April 1990 along Maharlika Highway in San Pablo City, Laguna. Three persons died as a result, and for their death, petitioner Arnel Gabriel (Gabriel) was found guilty of the crime of 
Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Double Homicide and Damage to Property
 by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Pablo City.
3
 Gabriel fruitlessly appealed to the Court of Appeals, which modified the RTC’s decision by finding Gabriel liable instead for 
Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Multiple Homicide
.

The 
Information
 against Gabriel reads:




The undersigned Asst. City Prosecutor accuses ARNEL GABRIEL of the crime of RECKLESS IMPRUDENCE RESULTING TO MULTIPLE HOMICIDE, SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURIES AND DAMAGE TO PROPERTY under Art. 365 of the Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:




That on or about April 19, 1990, in the City of San Pablo, Republic of the Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused above-named, being then the driver and person in charge of a passenger type jeep with Plate No. NCF-726, owned by Marcelino Gabriel and insured with Interworld Assurance Corporation, Legaspi Village, Makati, Metro Manila, did then and there recklessly, carelessly, imprudently and negligently manage and operate said vehicle along Brgy. San Vicente, this city and without due regard to traffic rules and regulation (sic) and imprudence hit the Volkswagen car with Plate No. DAU-203 driven by Fernando Pitargue and owned by Dr. Philip Plantilla, insured with Jon Doe Insurance, causing damage to said car in the amount of ₱50,000.00, Philippine Currency and inflicting mortal wounds to Fernando Pitargue and Carlos Asistido which caused their immediate death and injuries to Dr. Philip Plantilla which required medical attendance for a period of more than 30 days and incapacitated the said Dr. Philip Plantilla from performing his customary labor during the same period of time.




CONTRARY TO LAW.

The three vehicles involved in the collision were a passenger type jeep (jeepney),
6
 a Volkswagen Beetle car (Beetle),
7
 and a six-wheeler Isuzu delivery truck (six-wheeler).
8
 The Beetle carried three persons, including Dr. Philip Plantilla, director of the Nagcarlan District Hospital, who was injured in the accident. The other two occupants of the Beetle died in the accident — the driver, Fernando Pitargue, Sr., and Carlos Asistido.
9
 The third fatality, Isabela Banes, was one of the passengers of the jeepney driven by Gabriel.
10
 On the other hand, the six-wheeler was driven by Romeo Macabuhay, who also appeared as the principal witness of the prosecution.
11
 


The mishap occurred on the stretch of the Maharlika Highway located in Barangay San Vicente, San Pablo City. The highway is a two-lane, two-way road. The prosecution alleged that on the night of the accident, the Beetle and the six-wheeler were both traveling on the same lane of Maharlika Highway, proceeding towards the direction of San Pablo City. The six-wheeler was behind the Beetle. The jeepney, on the other hand, was travelling the opposite lane on the way to Atimonan, Quezon, purportedly at high speed. After negotiating a curve, the jeepney veered out of its lane, swerving into the lane occupied by the Beetle and the six-wheeler. The jeepney collided with the left side of the Beetle, forcing the latter out of the road and into the right shoulder of the highway. The collision with the Beetle also forced the jeepney to turn turtle and thereafter hit the front portion of the truck, which was then fifteen (15) meters behind the Beetle. The second impact forced the jeepney into the same right shoulder lane where the stricken Beetle had rested. The six-wheeler meanwhile moved into the opposite side of the road and parked on the left shoulder of the highway. 


The three fatalities died on the spot. Their bodies lay prostrate on the ground by the time the police arrived at the scene. The investigation at the scene was conducted by Patrolman Jerryson Laguras, who prepared a sketch showing the relative positions of the vehicles and other significant findings.
12
 Laguras also prepared the police report. He testified as a prosecution witness. The prosecution also presented the truck driver, Macabuhay, who recounted the collisions he had witnessed. Dr. Plantilla likewise testified on the injuries he sustained and the expenses he incurred.
13
 


Gabriel, in defense, admitted driving the jeepney on the night in question at the Maharlika Highway, on his way to Quezon. While negotiating a curve near the scene of the accident, Gabriel noticed the headlights of an oncoming vehicle focused towards his direction. He maneuvered his jeepney to the right of the road, and switched to low gear. Despite the defensive moves which had put the jeepney’s right front and rear wheels on the road shoulder, according to Gabriel, his jeepney was bumped by the Beetle still. The left front wheel burst, causing the jeepney to swerve to the right, fall on its right side, and slide towards the center of the highway. At that point, the jeepney was placed on the other direction — towards San Pablo City. In that position, the jeepney was hit by the six-wheeler, causing some of the occupants of the jeepney to be thrown out. One of them, Menandro Marquez, testified for the defense. He claimed that he was seated at the front seat of the jeepney, adding that the jeepney, while on the extreme right of the Quezon-bound lane, was bumped by a brightly lighted vehicle.
14
 


Another witness for the defense, Barangay Chairman Dominador Gonzales, Jr. of San Vicente, San Pablo City, corroborated Gabriel’s version of the events. He claimed witnessing the collision, which occurred after the Beetle had tried to overtake the six-wheeler truck.
15
 The Beetle’s attempt to overtake led to its collision with the jeepney traveling on the opposite lane.
16


In convicting Gabriel, the RTC found the prosecution’s version of the facts to be more credible. The dispositive portion of the RTC decision reads, thus:




WHEREFORE, finding the accused Arnel Gabriel guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Double Homicide and Damage to Property, he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from two (2) years and four (4) months of prision correccional as minimum to six (6) years also of prision correccional as maximum and to make the following indemnifications:

b) For reimbursement of his gifts to the doctors and nurses who attended to him at the Makati Medical Center
 
 
10,000.00


c) For actual damages of his Volkswagen car which was a total wreck
 
50,000.00"
