CARPIO MORALES, 
J.:


The present Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court raises the issue of whether the unilateral adoption by an employer of an upgraded salary scale that increased the hiring rates of new employees without increasing the salary rates of old employees resulted in wage distortion within the contemplation of Article 124 of the Labor Code.


Bankard, Inc. (Bankard) classifies its employees by levels, to wit: Level I, Level II, Level III, Level IV, and Level V. On May 28, 1993, its Board of Directors approved a ""New Salary Scale"", made retroactive to April 1, 1993, for the purpose of making its hiring rate competitive in the industry’s labor market. The ""New Salary Scale"" increased the hiring rates of new employees, to wit: Levels I and V by one thousand pesos (P1,000.00), and Levels II, III and IV by nine hundred pesos (P900.00). Accordingly, the salaries of employees who fell below the new minimum rates were also adjusted to reach such rates under their levels.


Bankard’s move drew the Bankard Employees Union-WATU (petitioner), the duly certified exclusive bargaining agent of the regular rank and file employees of Bankard, to press for the increase in the salary of its old, regular employees.


Bankard took the position, however, that there was no obligation on the part of the management to grant to all its employees the same increase in an across-the-board manner.


As the continued request of petitioner for increase in the wages and salaries of Bankard’s regular employees remained unheeded, it filed a Notice of Strike on August 26, 1993 on the ground of discrimination and other acts of Unfair Labor Practice (ULP).


A director of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board treated the Notice of Strike as a ""Preventive Mediation Case"" based on a finding that the issues therein were ""not strikeable"".


Petitioner filed another Notice of Strike on October 8, 1993 on the grounds of refusal to bargain, discrimination, and other acts of ULP - union busting. The strike was averted, however, when the dispute was certified by the Secretary of Labor and Employment for compulsory arbitration.


The Second Division of the NLRC, by Order of May 31, 1995, finding no wage distortion, dismissed the case for lack of merit.


Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the case was, by Resolution of July 28, 1995, denied.


Petitioner thereupon filed a petition for certiorari before this Court, docketed as G.R. 121970. In accordance with its ruling in 
St. Martin Funeral Homes v. NLRC,
1
 the petition was referred to the Court of Appeals which, by October 28, 1999, denied the same for lack of merit.


Hence, the present petition which faults the appellate court as follows:




(1) It misapprehended the basic issues when it concluded that under Bankard’s new wage structure, the old salary gaps between the different classification or level of employees were ""still reflected"" by the adjusted salary rates
2
; and


(2) It erred in concluding that ""wage distortion does not appear to exist"", which conclusion is manifestly contrary to law and jurisprudence.

Upon the enactment of R.A. No. 6727 (WAGE RATIONALIZATION ACT, amending, among others, Article 124 of the Labor Code) on June 9, 1989, the term ""wage distortion"" was explicitly defined as:


... a situation where an increase in prescribed wage rates results in the elimination or severe contraction of intentional quantitative differences in wage or salary rates between and among employee groups in an establishment as to effectively obliterate the distinctions embodied in such wage structure based on skills, length of service, or other logical bases of differentiation.

Prubankers Association v. Prudential Bank and Trust Company

 laid down the four elements of wage distortion, to wit: (1.) An existing hierarchy of positions with corresponding salary rates; (2) A significant change in the salary rate of a lower pay class without a concomitant increase in the salary rate of a higher one; (3) The elimination of the distinction between the two levels; and (4) The existence of the distortion in the same region of the country.


Normally, a company has a wage structure or method of determining the wages of its employees. In a problem dealing with ""wage distortion,"" the basic assumption is that there exists a grouping or classification of employees that establishes distinctions among them on some relevant or legitimate bases.

Involved in the classification of employees are various factors such as the degrees of responsibility, the skills and knowledge required, the complexity of the job, or other logical basis of differentiation. The differing wage rate for each of the existing classes of employees reflects this classification.


Petitioner maintains that for purposes of wage distortion, the classification is not one based on ""levels"" or ""ranks"" but on two groups of employees, the newly hired and the old, in each and every level, and not between and among the different levels or ranks in the salary structure.


Public respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) refutes petitioner’s position, however. It, through the Office of the Solicitor General, essays in its Comment of April 12, 2000 as follows:


To determine the existence of wage distortion, the ""historical"" classification of the employees prior to the wage increase must be established. Likewise, it must be shown that as between the different classification of employees, there exists a ""historical"" gap or difference.

The classification preferred by petitioner is belied by the wage structure of private respondent as shown in the new salary scale it adopted on May 28, 1993
, retroactive to April 1, 1993, which provides, thus:
