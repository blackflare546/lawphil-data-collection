G.R. No. 101801-03	May 2, 1995


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, 
plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


EDUARDO ""EDDIE"" TAMI 
alias 
""JOJO"", 
accused-appellant.




KAPUNAN, 
J.:


Once again the case before us illustrates the continuing social malady of revolting sexual deviance.


On February 27, 1990, Ruel Paderna, Froilan Landrio, Geralyn Landrio, Imelda Mamasig, Arthur Trajano, Arnel Pacardo and complainant Amelita Dequito, all teenagers and residents of barangay Labangal, went to downtown General Santos City to witness and take part in the commemoration of the landing of General Paulino Santos and the first batch of National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) settlers in Dadiangas before the 2nd World War. They arrived at about nine o'clock in the evening at Lion's Beach and stayed for only twenty (20) minutes. Thereafter, they proceeded to the plaza to watch the program at the City Hall. They stayed until one o'clock in the morning after which they boarded a tricycle to go home. The tricycle driver however brought them only as far as Silway Bridge because of fear of hold-uppers farther on.
1


At the foot of Silway Bridge, they got off and began to trek home. When they reached the middle of the bridge, another tricycle arrived. On board were Eduardo Tami and Mohammad Bagatao who, from a distance of about 30 meters, shouted at them to stop. Bagatao pulled out a gun and pointed it to them while walking towards them. At this point, Geralyn Landrio, Froilan Landrio and Arthur Trajano decided to flee and ran away from their companions. Obviously, the other four were left behind to wait for Bagatao and Tami. As they approached, Bagatao asked Ruel Paderna if the latter knew him. Paderna answered in the affirmative and said they were schoolmates.
2


Bagatao then herded the group towards a coconut grove where he pistol-whipped Paderna on the head once and Pacardo twice. Afterwards, he ordered them to leave. As the group started to move on, Tami told Bagatao to leave one of the girls behind. There upon, Tami pulled away Amelita Dequito from Paderna's grasp and told the others to leave without Amelita. Helpless, the others did as they were ordered to.
3




From there, Paderna, Pacardo and Mamasig proceeded to the police sub-station at Makar, General Santos City to report the abduction of Amelita. Efforts were made by P/Sgt. George Taborete and his group to look for Amelita Dequito but the same were fruitless.
4




In the meantime, while everybody else was looking for her, Amelita Dequito suffered a most harrowing experience and grave violation upon her person and her chastity. She narrated her sordid experience through her testimony on direct examination, thus:

After Amelita ran away from Eddie Tami, she proceeded to the house of Ruel Paderna, her boyfriend, and related to him and his family her agonizing experience. Ruel's father then went to the police station and later fetched Amelita's mother and sister.
6
 Thereafter, all of them went to the police sub-station at Makar to report the incident. At the said station, Amelita told the police that Bagatao might still be found asleep in his uncle's hut at Purok Maguindanao.
7


At around six o'clock in the morning of February 20, 1990, the law enforcers led by P/Cpl. George Taborete together with Ruel's father, Amelita's mother and Amelita herself, went to the hut of Bagatao's uncle. Bagatao was indeed still asleep as Amelita had surmised and awoke only when P/Cpl. Taborete took the gun from under his pillow.
8
 He was then placed under arrest by P/Cpl. Taborete and was brought to the Makar police sub-station. 
9
 There, he was identified by Amelita as one of the culprits of the dastardly crime committed against her. 
10
 
The handgun used by him was likewise identified by Amelita. 
11


Later on, at around eight o'clock in the morning, Amelita was brought to the Emergency Hospital at General Santos City to undergo physical examination. Dr. Zaldy Lim conducted the examination and accordingly issued a Medical Certificate 
12
 which reveals the following findings, 
viz
:






The hymen was not intact but with 3 and 6 o'clock position lacerations, positive, whitish, vicid material vaginal canal. There is a possibility that it could be semen. Contusion 2 x 2 mm. lateral aspect distal 3rd radius left and right (side of the left and right wrist) and abrasion linear 1 cm. 3rd hetacpophayyngeal joint posterior aspect right (between the fingers and the back of the left hand). The laceration could be less than 48 hours. 
13






Consequently, an information was filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 23, General Santos City and docketed as Criminal Case No. 6175, accusing MOHAMMAD BAGATAO, 
alias 
""Glo"" and appellant EDDIE TAMI, 
alias

In another Information filed, appellant EDDIE TAMI, 
alias
 ""Jojo"" was charged, in Criminal Case No. 6176, for Rape, committed as follows:






That on February 28, 1990, at about past 3:00 o'clock in the morning, in the campus of Saavedra Saway Elementary School in Labangal, General Santos City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a gun and by means of intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of complainant against her will and that thereafter complainant was brought to the concrete wall of another school buildings and accused did then and there, with intimidation, have carnal knowledge of complainant against her will for the second time.


CONTRARY TO LAW.
15






In a related Information filed, accused MOHAMMAD BAGATAO, 
alias 
""Glo"" was charged, in Criminal Case No. 6177, for violation of P.D. 1866 (Illegal Possession of Firearm), committed as follows:






That on February 28, 1990 in Labangal, General Santos City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession and control one (1) homemade (paltik) 20 gauge pistol without having obtained the necessary permit or license to possess the same from proper government agencies, which firearm he used in the commission of the crime of Forcible Abduction with Rape.


CONTRARY TO LAW.
16






Since the three (3) cases arose out from the same incident and involved the same parties, they were tried jointly.


Upon arraignment, appellant and his co-accused pleaded ""Not Guilty"" to the offenses charged in the Informations. Accordingly, trial on the merits ensued.


On June 17, 1991, the trial court rendered a Consolidated Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:






WHEREFORE, the Court renders the following judgments:






A.	CRIMINAL CASE NO. 6177

	FOR ILLEGAL POSSESSION

	OF FIREARM






For failure of the prosecution to prove the negative fact alleged in the information that is, the accused Mohammad Bagatao possessed the firearm, Exhibit ""B"", without a license or permit to possess the same, the said accused MOHAMMAD BAGATAO is ACQUITTED on reasonable doubt.


The gun, Exhibit ""B"", is confiscated and forfeited in favor or the Government.






B.	CRIMINAL CASE NO. 6175

	FOR ABDUCTION WITH RAPE.






Finding accused Mohammad Bagatao and Eduardo ""Eddie"" Tami guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of abduction with rape on three (3) counts committed with the use of a deadly weapon, plus the established fact that the rapes were committed by two persons, the Court hereby sentences both accused MOHAMMAD BAGATAO and EDUARDO ""EDDIE"" TAMI to THREE (3) death penalties. But considering that under the Constitution, the death penalty shall no longer be imposed, the Court hereby sentences MOHAMMAD BAGATAO and EDUARDO ""EDDIE"" TAMI to THREE (3) 
reclusion perpetuas
 each. Pursuant to Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code, they shall not remain in prison for more than forty (40) years.






C.	CRIMINAL CASE NO. 6176 FOR RAPE






Finding accused Eduardo ""Eddie"" Tami guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape on two (2) counts, the Court hereby sentences accused EDUARDO ""EDDIE"" TAMI to TWO (2) 
reclusion perpetuas
.


Although accused Eduardo ""Eddie"" Tami has been sentenced to a total of five (5) 
reclusion perpetuas,
 the maximum period of his imprisonment shall not exceed forty (40) years (Article 70, RPC).


Both accused Mohammad Bagatao and Eduardo ""Eddie"" Tami shall serve their sentences at the National Penitentiary at Muntinlupa, Rizal. In the computation of the forty (40) years, the maximum period that they shall remain in prison, each is credited with 4/5 of his preventive imprisonment.


Each of the accused is further sentenced to pay Amelita Dequito, the offended party, the sum of TWENTY-FIVE (P25,000.00) each for moral damages.


SO ORDERED. 
17






Aggrieved by the above-quoted ruling, only appellant Eduardo ""Eddie"" Tami interposed the present appeal ascribing to the court 
a quo
 the following errors, to wit:






1.	The court erred in finding the accused guilty of having conspired with Mohammad Bagatao to abduct and rape the complainant three times.






a.	The court erred in finding that the complainant was raped twice at the Acharon Beach-first near the Shellane Compound and the second beside the Veres Ice Plant;


b.	Assuming the complainant was raped by Bagatao at the Acharon Beach, the court erred in finding the accused guilty with Bagatao for the alleged rape near the Shellane Compound.


c.	Assuming the complainant was raped by Bagatao the second time at the Acharon Beach, the court erred in finding the accused guilty with Bagatao for the alleged rape beside the Veres Ice Plant.


d.	The court erred in finding the accused guilty of rape with Bagatao who forcibly had sexual intercourse with the complainant at the hut of Bagatao's uncle at Purok Maguindanao.






2.	 The court erred in finding the accused, armed with a gun, guilty of having raped the complainant twice at the Saavedra Saway Elementary School.


3.	The court erred in not acquitting the accused on the ground that his guilt has not been proven beyond reasonable ground (
sic
).
18






The appeal is not impressed with merit.


Appellant vehemently denies participation in the crimes charged in the informations. In his brief, he maintains that he did not conspire with co-accused Bagatao to abduct complainant Amelita Dequito and that the prosecution failed to prove that he had come to an agreement with Bagatao to commit the crime charged. He asserts that he was just following the orders of his cousin 

Bagatao when he acted as a ""lookout"" while the former was sexually assaulting Amelita. 
19


This contention spurs disbelief.


It is true that there is no evidence on record of a previous agreement between the accused to abduct Amelita in order to rape her and that no witness testified to having seen or heard the accused conspire. However, it is a well-settled rule that for collective responsibility to be established, it is not necessary that conspiracy be proved by direct evidence of a prior agreement to commit the crime. It is sufficient that at the time of the commission of the offense, all the accused acted in concert showing that they had the same purpose or common design and were united in its execution. 
20
 In the case at bench, the simultaneous and participatory acts of the appellant and his co-accused reveal a community of design, an 
indicia
 of a conspiracy to forcibly abduct complainant Amelita Dequito for the satisfaction of their carnal desires against her will. To hold an accused liable as co-principal by reason of conspiracy, he must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the conspiracy. That overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself, or it may consist of moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being present at the time of the commission of the crime or by exerting moral ascendancy over the other co-conspirators by moving them to execute or implement the conspiracy.
21
 In this case, contrary to his protestation that he only acted as ""lookout "", appellant was not merely present when the crime charged was committed. He actually took part in the sexual assault, And the finding of the trial court reveal just that hence, the same is accordingly afforded weight and respect and we quote:






The evidence of the prosecution that Bagatao and Tami conspired in abducting Amelita is clear. 
When Bagatao told the four to go, Tami said to them to leave one of the women, and grabbed and pulled Amelita away Ruel Paderna, who was holding her by the hand, and ordered the other there to leave. When the three hesitated, Bagatao pointed his gun to them saying that he would shot (sic) them if they did not leave. It was Tami who pulled Amelita's panty off her legs when Bagatao was on top of Amelita, and it was Tami who removed Bagatao's brief when the latter was on top of Amelita, ready to do the act. When Amelita refused to spread her legs, Tami, on the say so of his cousin, held Amelita's feet and spread her legs apart and then Bagatao sent his penis home, that is, to the vulva of Amelita. And when 5 persons came near the scene, and Bagatao walked over to them, to talk with them, Tami inserted the muzzle of Bagatao's gun into the mouth of the girl to threaten her not to let out an outcry.


Beside the Veres Ice Plant, where Bagatao and Tami took her to, and where Bagatao made his second fling, with the girl. Bagatao handed his gun to Tami, and the latter watched Bagatao do the act from a very near distance. After Amelita had put on her dress with the help of Tami, the two cousins took her to Purok Maguindanao, particularly to a hut owned by Bagatao's uncle, and there Bagatao had the third fling with her, again against her will. Again, Tami was there
. Before Bagatao went to sleep, he bound Amelita's hands behind her. Conspiracy is evident in Criminal Case No. 6175. That Mohammad Bagatao and Eduardo ""Eddie"" Tami conspired in the commission of the crime of abduction with rape is not doubted. 
22
 
(Emphasis ours)






Anent appellant's contention that he was only acting on orders of his co-accused Bagatao, it would suffice to state that to be free of criminal culpability, a person invoking irresistible force or uncontrollable fear must show that the force exerted was such that it reduced him to a mere instrument acting not only without will but against his will as well. 
23
 Compulsion must be of such character as to leave appellant no opportunity for self-defense in equal combat or for escape. 
24
 
In the instant case, appellant failed to prove that he was without any choice but to follow the orders of Bagatao. Records bear out that he did not take advantage of the numerous opportunities presented before him to leave the scene prior to and during the commission of the acts complained of to avoid any impression that he was part of the conspiracy.


On the issue of credibility of witnesses and evidence adduced before the court 
a quo
, we sustain the trial judge in giving credence to the evidence of the prosecution after having assessed it as against the testimony of the defense witnesses, whose demeanor he also had the opportunity to observe personally. His impressions on the matter at hand are binding on us in the absence of a clear showing of a grave abuse of discretion or an obvious misapprehension of the facts. In the instant case, we do not find such flaws in the factual conclusions of the court 
a quo
.


Moreover, the manner in which Amelita Dequito narrated the commission of the crime charged is admirable for its spontaneity and clarity. It was positive and categorical. The trial court's finding on this is apt:






In crimes of rape, which is said to be the human male's worse indiscretion because he stoops to the level of the lower animals, the brutes, the beasts, the testimony of the offended party, in most cases, is the only available testimonial evidence to prove its commission. But what counts is which of the testimonies, that of the offended party's or that of the defendant's is more believable, more credible more logical, more reasonable. This situation gives the courts of justice a hard time in deciding whether to accept the uncorroborated testimony of the offended party or not. But this Court was not had put to accept as true the testimony of Amelita Dequito that she had been abducted by the two accused and raped. The commission of the rapes had been clearly established by the evidence of the prosecution. The testimony of Amelita Dequito, in all regards, is believable, conclusive, logical and probable, while those of Bagatao's and Tami's are just the opposite that they are unbelievable, illogical, improbable, and are all contrary to human expectations and behaviours. The Court can not believe that Amelita Dequito, a decent girl from a decent family, who had a boyfriend, who was with her at the time, would take Bagatao to the uncle's house, much less go with him to the uncle's house, nor go with to the hut in dead of the night. No amount of specious reasoning or testimony could set the mind of the Court to believe the truth, or the half truth, or even plausible. Defendant's defense is palpably and miserably weak. It has failed to impress the court. The most that it has done to the court was to insult its intelligence. The defendants cannot say that the court has only the complainants' words for the rapes. Ruel Paderna and Arnel Pecardo testified on the events preceding the rapes, which, of course, they had not witnessed. Paderna and Pecardo corroborated Amelita's testimony to the effect that the defendants by means of force and intimidation took her away from her companions. The abduction was forcible. Ruel Paderna, Amelita's sweetheart; Arnel Pecardo; and Imelda Mamasig lost no time in reporting the abduction to the police. Amelita Dequito, the offended party, lost no time in reporting the attack against her honor to the police after she regained her freedom from her attackers. She guided the police to the hut where defendant Bagatao had his last fling with her. She went to the Emergency Hospital for medical examination at 8 o'clock of February 28, 1990 and gave her sworn statement to police investigator Taborete on the afternoon of February 28, 1990. 
25






Appellant further claims that regardless of whether he had a gun or not, it is simply incredible that he would rape victim Amelita twice at different places in the same school after she already allegedly had been raped thrice by 

Bagatao. 
26
 Appellant argues that from the time he and complainant left the hut of Ulama (Bagatao's uncle) up to the point that he brought her to Silway bridge and let her go, the interval was not long enough to physically able him to consummate two sexual intercourses with her. Similarly, appellant reasons out it was highly improbable for Bagatao to have performed three successive sexual intercourses in just a span of one or two hours. 
27


This claim deserves no merit.


Appellant's pretended apprehension on his physical capacity to consummate sex two times and on his co-accused three times does not persuade us. We certainly find nothing incredible in Amelita's testimony as to the number of times she was raped. Given the two accused's physical built and age at the time of the commission of the crime, 
28
 we find no physical impossibility in their consummating the sexual assaults in the given period of time. In 
People v. Ramos
, 
29
 we held that:






As to the claim of appellant that it was physically impossible for him to have committed the three rapes, in succession within a period of three to four hours, Dra. Lolita Mercado, an expert witness categorically declared in court that Mario Ramos is capable of raping any woman, and based on her examination of Ramos, it is possible that in three and one half (3 1/2) minutes after the first he can again have the next sexual coition. Appellant 's sexual prowess was likewise attested to on cross-examination by his wife. . . .


xxx			xxx			xxx


At any rate, on the matter of sexual outlet, there are high-rating individuals belonging to the so-called ""sexual athlete"" class. The noted sexologist Kinsey says that intervals between climaxes may range from 10 seconds to 3 minutes. 
30






When a young and decent Filipina testifies that she was raped she says all that is necessary to show its commission. Considering the inbred modesty and antipathy of a Filipina to airing in public things that affect her honor, it is hard to conceive that the complainant would assume and admit the molestation and ignominy she had undergone, 
31
 and endure the ordeal of testifying to all its shameful details, if she had not in fact been raped. 
32
 Moreover, appellant and his co-accused were positively identified by complainant and two other witnesses Ruel Paderna and Arnel Pacardo who testified on the events leading to the forcible abduction, 
i.e.
, the taking away of complainant from her companions by means of force and intimidation. Amelita's testimony as to who abused her is credible where, as in this case, she had absolutely no motive to incriminate and testify against appellant and his do-accused.


Finally, appellant contends that the trial court erred in imposing on him the penalty of five (5) 
reclusion perpetuas
. He claims that, at most, he should only be found guilty of having committed two (2) counts of forcible abduction with rape. 
33


We do not agree.


Considering the foregoing findings on conspiracy with Bagatao insofar as the forcible abduction with rape is concerned and on two (2) separate counts of rape committed by appellant himself, appellant is therefore liable for one (1) forcible abduction with rape and four (4) counts of rape pursuant to our ruling in 
People v. Jose
 
34
 reiterated in 
People v. Bohos 
35
 where we held that:






Appellant's other point is: ""Even if we may assume purely for the sake of argument that the complaining witness was forcibly abducted and then raped thirteen times, we submit that there was only one forcible abduction, with rape and that was the one allegedly committed on the truck of jeep. Any subsequent acts of intercourse in the house against her will would be only separate acts of rape and can no longer be considered separate complex crimes of forcible abduction with rape.""


This point is well taken. There was only one forcible abduction with rape which was the one committed in the truck. Thus in 
People v. Jose, et al
., G.R. No . L-28232, Feb. 6, 1971, 37 SCRA 450, where the four accused forcibly abducted Maggie de la Riva and each of them raped her, this Court held ""that even while the first act of rape was being performed, the crime of forcible abduction had already been consummated, so that each of the three succeeding crimes of the same nature can not legally be considered as still connected with the abduction — in other words, they should be detached from, and considered independently of, that of forcible abduction and, therefore, the former can no longer be complexed with the latter."" 
36






Consequently, the appellant was correctly imposed the penalty of five (5) 
reclusion perpetuas.
 However, in view of recent jurisprudence, the award of moral damages to complainant Amelita Dequito is increased from P25,000.00 to P50,000.00 for each of the crimes he committed.


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED subject to the modification on the amount of moral damages, which is increased from P25,000.00 to P50,000.00 for each of the crimes appellant Eduardo ""Eddie"" Tami committed.


SO ORDERED.
