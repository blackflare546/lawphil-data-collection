vs.


DELFIN REYES y LAZARO, RODOLFO MACALINAO, DAN REYES and DODO REYES, 
accused-appellants.




VITUG, 
J.:


Accused-appellants Delfin Reyes y Lazaro, Rodolfo Macalinao, Dan Reyes and Dodo Reyes were charged with rape before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 14, Malolos, Bulacan, in an information that read:




The undersigned Provincial Fiscal, on complaint of the offended party Milagros T. Fabian, accuses Delfin Reyes y Lazaro, Rodolfo Macalinao, Dan Reyes and Dodo Reyes of the crime of rape, penalized under the provisions of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:


That on or about the 17th day of August, 1982, in the municipality of Hagonoy, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused Delfin Reyes y Lazaro, Rodolfo Macalinao, Dan Reyes and Dodo Reyes, conspiring confederating together and mutually helping one another by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the offended party Milagros T. Fabian, a pregnant and married woman, against her will and by means of force.

After trial, following the ""not guilty"" plea of the accused, the prosecution so presented as its witnesses the victim herself, Milagros Fabian, her husband Luis Fabian, Hagonoy police investigator Eloy Enriquez Balatbat and examining physician Dr. Hermogenes Deogracias. The trial court, giving credence to their testimony, summed up its findings thusly:




The evidence on record shows that on August 17, 1982, the Spouses Luis Fabian and Milagros Fabian were living in Sitio Alimango, San Rogue, Hagonoy, Bulacan. They are staying in a small hut by the fishpond of which Luis was the overseer. They had lived a quiet, peaceful and simple life until the evening of August 17, 1982 when the accused Delfin Reyes, Rodolfo Macalinao, Dan Reyes and Dodo Reyes arrived in their place.


Delfin invited him to steal milkfish but he refused the invitation, then Delfin drew his cal. .45 pistol and pointed it on his temple and Dan and Rodolfo tied his hands, they were then under the shade (hulog) of the hut. Then the accused, Rodolfo Macalinao, Dan Reyes and Dodo Reyes entered the hut, tied the hands of Milagros, tore her dress and removed her panty. She pleaded to the accused not to molest her but her pleas were not heeded and the accused begun to ravish her one after the other in the presence of her husband who was more or less 1 1/2 meters away from her.


The first to abuse her was Rodolfo Macalinao, the next was Dan Reyes and the last was Dodo Reyes. Delfin Reyes, as testified by Milagros, did not have sex with her but during the time that his three (3) companions were abusing her, Delfin Reyes pointed his pistol on Luis.


The accused were able to consummate sexual act with her as stated by Milagros, because they were able to insert their penies inside her vagina and she even felt it.


That she was able to recognize all the accused, whom she identified inside the court room, because of the light that was emanating from their kerosene lamp that hanged by the door of their hut.


That upon insistent request of the defense counsel, Milagros Fabian was ordered by the Court to re-enact in open court how she was raped by the accused to which she complied by going down the witness stand, then lie down on the floor and demonstrated the way how she was sexually abused. This is a fatal error committed by the defense counsel for re-enactment of a crime is only availed of by the prosecution to show how a crime was committed.


After the accused had committed their heinous act, they left. Then Luis was able to loosen the tie of his hands and after freeing himself he untied the hands of his wife.


The following morning they reported the incident to the police which fact was testified to by policeman Eloy Enriquez Balatbat of Hagonoy, Bulacan who entered the incident in the police blotter as evidenced by Exhibits ""J"" and ""J-l"" the investigation report.


That on August 20, 1982 Milagros was examined, her body and genitalia by Dr. Hermogenes Deogracias and his findings show that Milagros suffered fragmented lacerations of the hymen which could have been caused by previous delivery or frequent sexual intercourse. Milagros being pregnant at the time of the incident, the lacerations of her hymen could have been caused by the multiple intercourse committed by the three (3) accused upon her. Dr. Deogracias also stated that before he examined Milagros he took a short clinical history of the case and according to Milagros she was sexually abused.

The trial court was not persuaded by the defense put up by accused-appellants, and it rendered judgment convicting them of the offense charged. Hence —




WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered, finding the accused Rodolfo Macalinao, Dan Reyes, Dodo Reyes and Delfin Reyes, the latter as co-principal by cooperation, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and, each accused are hereby sentenced to a penalty of triple (3) 
Reclusion Perpetua
.


To indemnify jointly and severally the offended party Milagros Fabian P30,000.00 and P10,000.00 moral damages with costs.


The bonds of the accused are hereby ordered cancelled and their immediate detention to the National Penitentiary through the Provincial Warden of Malolos, Bulacan is ordered pending review of their case by the Supreme Court.

In this appeal, accused-appellants raise a number of points, concentrating themselves by and large on the question of the credibility of witnesses. We have closely gone over the records to see whether enough justification so exists as to permit a departure from the generally accepted norm that the assessment of the trial court on the issue of the probity of witnesses is to be held preponderant and greatly entitled to respect (People vs. Lakibul, 217 SCRA 575). The results of our examination lead us to say, once again, that the rule must be upheld. Witness the unswerving account of the victim:

The appellants would urge the Court to instead focus its attention to the alleged discordance in the evidence for the prosecution. Thus, while the Fabian spouses both stated that the crime had occurred between midnight and one o'clock in the morning of 17 August 1982, the defense, however, would want undue significance to be given to what the prosecutor had casually said, 
i.e.
, that the incident took place in the evening of 17 August 1982. Clearly, the remark of the prosecutor was a mere unguarded statement, and it should not have any serious adverse impact on the testimony of the victim and her husband. Regarding the supposed inconsistency on the exact date when the report to the authorities was made, it would appear that Milagros and Luis actually went to the police station not once but twice at least, the first time on 17 August 1982 and then, again, a few days later. 
6
 
Other alleged discrepancies, such as the specific details on how Milagros Fabian was abused or when the medical examination was conducted, hardly could be considered all that consequential. In the past, we commented, in fact, that minor incongruences would be indicative of honest and unrehearsed declarations or responses of witnesses and would thereby often enhance their credibility (People vs. Mohado
,
 227 SCRA 94).


Finally, too much is being stressed on the variance between the statement made by Luis Fabian before the police investigator and his testimony during the trial on how he and his wife were awaken. Differences in the narration of an incident between the sworn statement and the testimony of a witness are not unknown. The infirmity of an extra-judicial statement is a matter of judicial experience. An extra-judicial statement or affidavit is generally not prepared by the affiant himself but by another who uses his own language in writing the affiant's statement; hence, omissions and misunderstandings by the writer are not infrequent (People vs. Balderama, 226 SCRA 537; People vs. Gapasin, 145 SCRA 178; People vs. Mendoza
,
 105 SCRA 459;
 
People vs. Advincula
,
 96 SCRA 875). So, also, in People vs. Miranda
,
 235 SCRA 202, we have observed:




. . . Predictably, testimonies given during trials are much more exact and elaborate than those stated in sworn statements. 
Ex-parte
 affidavits are almost always incomplete and often inaccurate for varied reasons, at times because of partial and innocent suggestions or for want of specific inquiries. Witnesses cannot be expected everytime, except when told, to distinguish between what may be consequential and what may be mere insignificant details.




Conspiracy among the accused-appellants was clearly established. Accordingly, the trial court was correct in holding each of the conspirators liable for the criminal act of the others. The accused-appellants should, therefore, each suffer a three-fold penalty of 
reclusion perpetua, 
as well as be held solidarily liable for the civil indemnity which, by reason of the added repugnance of the bestial act being committed on a pregnant woman in the presence of her husband, is increased to P50,000.00, for each rape committed on Milagros Fabian.


WHEREFORE, based on all the foregoing considerations, the appealed decision is hereby AFFIRMED with the modification that the solidary civil indemnity of P50,000.00 is imposed on accused-appellants for each rape or the sum of P150,000.00.


SO ORDERED.
