 Petitioners,

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
 Respondent.


D E C I S I O N


VELASCO, JR., 
J.:


The instant petition under Rule 45 originated from 119 criminal cases
2
 filed with the Sandiganbayan (SB) involving no less than 36 former officials and employees of the then Ministry of Public Highways (MPH) and several suppliers of construction materials for defalcation of public funds arising from numerous transactions in the Cebu First Highway Engineering District in 1977. Because of the sheer magnitude of the illegal transactions, the number of people involved, and the ingenious scheme employed in defrauding the government, this infamous 86 million highway scam has few parallels in the annals of crime in the country.


The Case


Petitioners Simon Fernan, Jr. and Expedito Torrevillas seek the reversal of the December 4, 1997 Decision
3
 of the SB in the consolidated Criminal Case Nos. 1640, 1641, 1642, 1643, 1818, 1819, 1820, 1821, 1822, 1823, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882, 1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, 1887, 1888, 1889, 2839, 2840, 2841, 2842, 2843, 2844, 2845, 2846, 2847, 2848, 2849, 2850, 2851, 2852, 2853, 2854, 2855, 2856, 2857, 2858, 2859, 2860, 2861, 2862, 2863, 2864, 2865, 2866, 2867, 2868, 2869, 2870, 2871, 2872, 2873, 2874, 2875, 2876, 2877, 2878, 2879, 2880, 2881, 2882, 2883, 2884, 2885, 2886, 2887, 2888, 2889, 2890, 2891, 2892, 2893, 2894, 2895, 2896, 2897, 2898, 2899, 2900, 2901, 2902, 2903, 2904, 2905, 2906, 2907, 2908, 2909, 2910, 2911, 2912, 2913, 2915, 2917, 2918, 2919, 2920, 2921, 2922, 2923, 2924, 2925, 2926, 2927, 2928, 2929, 2930, 2931, 2932, 2936, 2937, 2938, and 2939,
4
 all entitled People of the Philippines v. Rocilo Neis, et al., finding them guilty of multiple instances of estafa through falsification of public documents;
5
 and the subsequent August 29, 2000 SB Resolution which denied their separate pleas for reconsideration.


Petitioner Fernan, Jr. disputes the adverse judgment in only six (6) cases, namely: 2879, 2880, 2881, 2885, 2914, and 2918; while petitioner Torrevillas seeks exoneration in nine (9) cases, namely: 2855, 2856, 2858, 2859, 2909, 2910, 2914, 2919, and 2932.


Both petitioners assert their strong belief that their guilt has not been established beyond reasonable doubt and, hence, exculpation is in order.


The Facts


The SB culled the facts
6
 this way:


On June 21, 1978, COA Regional Director Sofronio Flores Jr. of COA Regional Office No. 7, directed auditors Victoria C. Quejada and Ruth I. Paredes to verify and submit a report on sub-allotment advises issued to various highway engineering districts in Cebu, particularly, the Cebu City, Cebu 1st, Cebu 2nd and the Mandaue City Highway Engineering Districts. Complying with the directive, they conducted an investigation and in due course submitted their findings. Their report (Exhibit C) confirmed the issuance of fake Letters of Advice of Allotments (LAAs) in the districts mentioned. They discovered that two sets of LAAs were received by the districts. One set consists of regular LAAs which clearly indicated the covering sub-allotment advices and were duly signed by Mrs. Angelina Escaño, Finance Officer of the MPH Regional Office. The LAAs were numbered in proper sequence and duly recorded in the logbook of the Accounting, Budget and Finance Division. The other set consists of fake LAAs which do not indicate the covering sub-allotment advice and were signed by Chief Accountant Rolando Mangubat and Engr. Jose Bagasao, instead of the Finance Officer. These fake LAAs were not numbered in proper sequence; they were mostly undated and were sometimes duplicated. They could not be traced to the files and records of the Accounting, Budget and Finance Division. The accounting entry for the disbursements made on the fake LAAs was debited to the Accounts-Payable Unliquidated Obligations (8-81-400) and credited to the Checking Account with the Bureau of Treasury (8-70-790). Nevertheless, the expenditures were taken from obligations of the current year (1978) because all the supporting papers of the payment vouchers were dated in that year. The entries in the journal vouchers filed with the MPH Regional Office were adjusted every month to 8-81-400 (unliquidated or prior years obligation), 8-83-000 (liquidated or current year obligations) and 8-70-700 (Treasury/Agency Account). All of these were approved for the Finance Officer by Chief Accountant Rolando Mangubat. Mangubat, however, had no authority to approve them because since October 1977, he had already been detailed to the MPH Central Office. There were indications that the practice had been going on for years.

Due to these serious irregularities, then President Marcos created a Special Cabinet Committee on MPH Region VII ""Ghost Projects Anomalies"" which in turn organized a Special Task Force composed of representatives from the Finance Ministry Intelligence Bureau (FMIB), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the Bureau of Treasury and the Commission on Audit. The mission of the task force was to conduct a wider and more extended investigation in all the fifteen (15) highway engineering districts of MPH Region VII, including the Cebu First Highway Engineering District, the 1977 questionable disbursements of which are the subject matter of these cases.

For a better understanding of these highways cases, the flow in the release of funds to the various agencies of the government and the control devices set up for disbursement and accounting of public funds should first be explained. A chart (Exhibit B) graphically shows the flow of allotments from the Ministry down to the district level.


On the basis of appropriation laws and upon request made by heads of agencies, the then Ministry of Budget released funds to the various agencies of the government by means of an Advice of Allotment (AA) and a Cash Disbursement Ceiling (CDC). The Advice of Allotment is an authority for the agency to incur obligations within a specified amount in accordance with approved programs and projects. The Cash Disbursement Ceiling is an authority to pay. Upon receipt of the AA and CDC from the Budget, the Central Office of the agency prepares the Sub-Advice of Allotment (SAA) and the Advice of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (ACDC) for each region, in accordance with the disbursement allotment. These are sent to the Regional Office. Upon receipt, the Budget Officer of the region prepares the corresponding Letters of Advice of Allotment (LAA) which are forwarded to the various districts of the region (The amount that goes to each district is already indicated in the Advice of Allotment). Only upon receipt of the LAA is the district office authorized to incur obligations.


Now, how are funds released by the Regional Office to the different districts and ultimately paid out to contractors, the District Engineer submits to the Regional Director a request for allotment in accordance with the program of work prepared by the former. This procedure starts with the preparation of a Requisition for Supplies and Equipment (RSE) in the District Office by the Senior Civil Engineer, approved by the District Engineer, and signed by the Chief Accountant of the Highway Engineering District, who certifies as to the availability of funds. The RSE is then submitted to the Regional Director for approval. Once it is approved, a Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA) is prepared by the Chief Accountant of the district Senior Civil Engineer. The ROA signifies that a certain amount of district funds has been set aside or earmarked for the particular expenditures stated in the RSE. On the basis of the ROA, the District Office puts up advertisements, [conducts] biddings, makes awards and prepares purchase orders which are served on the winning bidder. The District Office also prepares a summary of deliveries with the corresponding delivery receipts and tally sheets, conducts inspection and prepares the General Voucher for the payment of deliveries. Once the General Voucher (GV) has been prepared, the corresponding check in the form of a Treasury Check Account for Agency (TCAA) is drawn by the Disbursing Officer and finally released to the contractor.


At the end of every month, the Report of Checks Issued by Deputized Disbursing Officer (RCIDD) is prepared, listing all the checks issued during that period. The RCIDDO is submitted to the accounting division of the region. Upon receipt of the RCIDDO, the Regional Office draws a journal voucher, debiting the account obligation (liquidated or unliquidated obligation, whichever is applicable), and crediting the account Treasury Check Account for Agency (TCAA). The RCIDDO is recorded in the Journal of Checks Issued by Deputized Disbursing Officers (JCIDDO) and posted in the general ledger at the end of each month.


Simultaneous with the flow of the RCIDDO, the ROAs are summarized in the Reports of Obligations Incurred (ROI) in the District Office, once or twice a month, depending upon the volume of transactions. The ROI is then submitted to the Regional Office. Upon receipt of the ROI, the accountant of the Regional Office draws a journal voucher taking up the following entry: debiting the appropriation allotted (0-90-000) and crediting the obligation incurred (0-82-000). This is recorded in the general voucher and posted to the general ledger at the end of each month. The journal voucher is prepared, closing the account 8-70-709 to 8-71-100-199 at the end of each month. It is also recorded and posted to the general ledger. At the end of the month, the balances of each account shown in the general ledger are summarized in a statement called the trial balance. The trial balance is submitted to the MPH Central Office in Manila where it is consolidated with other trial balances submitted by other regional offices.

The elaborate accounting procedure described above with its system of controls was set up obviously to make sure that government funds are properly released, disbursed and accounted for. In the hands of untrustworthy guardians of the public purse, however, it proved to be inadequate. There were loopholes which an unscrupulous person adroit in government accounting could take advantage of to surreptitiously draw enormous sums of money from the government.


Sometime in February, 1977, accused Rolando Mangubat (Chief Accountant), Delia Preagido (Accountant III), Jose Sayson (Budget Examiner), and Edgardo Cruz (Clerk II), all of MPH Region VII, met at the Town and Country Restaurant in Cebu City and hatched an ingenious plan to siphon off large sums of money from government coffers. Mangubat had found a way to withdraw government money through the use of fake LAAs, vouchers and other documents and to conceal traces thereof with the connivance of other government officials and employees. In fine, the fraudulent scheme involved the splitting of LAAs and RSEs so that the amount covered by each general voucher is less than P50,000.00 to do away with the approval of the Regional Auditor; the charging of disbursements to unliquidated obligations due the previous year to provide the supposed source of funds; and the manipulation of the books of account by negation or adjustment, i.e., the cancellation of checks through journal vouchers to conceal disbursements in excess of the cash disbursement ceiling (CDC), so as not to reflect such disbursements in the trial balances submitted to the Regional Office.


Mangubat enticed Preagido, Cruz and Sayson to join him. All three agreed to help him carry out his plan. They typed the fake LAAs during Saturdays. Cruz and Sayson also took charge of negotiating or selling the fake LAAs to contractors at 26% of the gross amount. Preagido on her part manipulated the General Ledger, Journal Vouchers and General Journal thru negative entries to conceal the illegal disbursements. Thus, in the initial report of the auditors (Exhibit D), it was discovered that the doubtful allotments and other anomalies escaped notice due to the following manipulations:


""The letter-advices covering such allotments (LAA) were generally not signed by the Finance Officer nor recorded in the books of accounts. Disbursements made on the basis of these fake LAAs were charged to the unliquidated Obligations (Account 8-81-400), although the obligations being paid were not among those certified to the unliquidated obligations (Account 8-81-400) at the end of the preceding year. To conceal the overcharges to authorized allotments, account 8-81-400 and the excess of checks issued over authorized cash disbursements ceiling, adjustments were prepared monthly through journal vouchers to take up the negative debit to Account 8-81-400 and a negative credit to the Treasury Checking Account for Agencies Account 8-70-790. These journal vouchers in effect cancelled the previous entry to record the disbursements made on the basis of the fake LAAs. Thus, the affected accounts (Accounts 8-81-400 and 8-70-790), as appearing in the trial balance would not show the irregularity. The checks, however, were actually issued.""


The four formed the nucleus of the nefarious conspiracy. Other government employees, tempted by the prospect of earning big money, allowed their names to be used and signed spurious documents.


Although the anomalies had been going on for sometime (February 1977 to June 1978), the PNB and Bureau of Treasury had no inkling about it until the NBI busted the illegal operations. (Some of the recipients of the stolen funds spent lavishly and bought two cars at a time). The reason for this is that, at that time, the PNB and Bureau of Treasury were not furnished copy of the mother CDC and the local branch of the PNB did not receive independent advice from the PNB head office in Manila. There were no deposits of money made with the PNB from which withdrawals could be charged. Only CDCs were presented to it, and not knowing that some of the CDCs were fake, the PNB branch paid out the checks drawn against them. The bank had also no way of knowing what amount was appropriated for the district; consequently, it did not know if the limit had already been exceeded. Only an insider steep in government accounting, auditing and banking procedures, particularly their flaws and loopholes, could have pulled off such an ingenious and audacious plan.

Focusing our attention now on the anomalies committed in the Cebu First District Engineering District, hereinafter referred to as the Cebu First HED for brevity, the Court finds that the same pattern of fraud employed in the other highway engineering districts in MPH Region VII was followed. The Cebu First HED received from Region VII thirty-four Letters of Advice of Allotment (LAAs) in the total sum of P4,734,336.50 and twenty-nine (29) corresponding Sub-Advices of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (SACDCs), amounting to P5,160,677.04 for the period January 1, 1977 to December 31, 1977. But apart from this, the Cebu First HED appears to have also received for the same period another set of eighty-four (84) LAAs amounting to P4,680,694.76 which however, could not be traced to any Sub-Advice of Allotment (SAA) or matched to the Advices of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (ACDCs) received from the MPH and Regional Office. This is highly irregular and not in consonance with accounting procedures.


It was also made to appear that the payments were made for alleged prior year’s obligations and chargeable to Account 8-81-400, obviously because, they were not properly funded. Furthermore, the list of projects in Region VII for 1977 showed that Cebu First HED completed rehabilitation and/or improvement of roads and bridges in its districts from February to May 1977, with expenditures amounting to P613,812.00. On the other hand, the expenditures for barangay roads in the same district in 1977 amounted to P140,692.00, and these were all completed within the period from November to December, 1977. These completed projects were properly funded by legitimate LAAs and CDCs in the total amount of only P754,504.00. However, an additional amount of P3,839,810.74 was spent by the Cebu First HED for maintenance of roads and bridges for the same year (1977) but the same could not be traced to any authoritative document coming from the MPH.


x x x x


A total of 132 General Vouchers, emanating from fake LAAs and ACDCs, were traced back to Rolando Mangubat, Regional Accountant of Region VII and Adventor Fernandez, Regional Highway Engineer, also of Region VII. Those LAAs and ACDCs became the vehicles in the disbursement of funds amounting to P3,839,810.74, through the vouchers purportedly issued for the purchase and delivery of the aforementioned materials allegedly used for the maintenance and repair of the national highways within the Cebu First HED. Despite the enormous additional expenditure of P3,839,810.74, the roads and bridges in the district, as found out by the NBI, did not show any improvement. As testified to by several barangay captains, the road maintenance consisted merely of spreading anapog or limestone on potholes of the national highway.


Obviously, the vouchers for payments of alleged maintenance of roads and bridges in the additional amount of P3,839,810.74 were prepared for no other purpose than to siphon the said amount from the government coffer into the pockets of some officials and employees of Region VII and the Cebu First HED, as well as the suppliers and contractors who conspired and confederated with them.


The nuclei of this massive conspiracy, namely: Rolando Mangubat, Jose Sayson, and Edgardo Cruz, all of MPH Region VII, were found guilty in all 119 counts and were accordingly sentenced by the SB. The other conniver, Delia Preagido, after being found guilty in some of the cases, became a state witness in the remainder. On the basis of her testimony and pertinent documents, Informations were filed, convictions were obtained, and criminal penalties were imposed on the rest of the accused.


On the other hand, petitioners were both Civil Engineers of the MPH assigned to the Cebu First Highway Engineering District. Petitioner Fernan, Jr. was included among the accused in Criminal Case Nos. 2879, 2880, 2881, 2885, 2914, and 2918 allegedly for having signed six (6) tally sheets or statements of deliveries of materials, used as bases for the preparation of the corresponding number of general vouchers. Fund releases were made to the suppliers, contractors, and payees based on these general vouchers.

Petitioners made the supplication before the court a quo to recall the adverse judgments against them which was declined by the August 29, 2000 SB Resolution.


Firm in their belief that they were innocent of any wrongdoing, they now interpose the instant petition to clear their names.


The Issues


Petitioners put forward two (2) issues, viz:




I


The honorable Sandiganbayan totally ignored petitioners constitutional right to be presumed innocent when it ruled that the burden of convincing the hon. Court that the deliveries of the road materials attested to have been received by them were not ghost deliveries rests with the accused and not with the prosecution.


II


The honorable sandiganbayan erred in convicting petitioners as co-conspirators despite the prosecution’s failure to specifically prove beyond reasonable doubt the facts and circumstances that would implicate them as co-conspirators and justify their conviction.




The Court’s Ruling


We are not persuaded to nullify the verdict.


Petitioners’ guilt was established beyond reasonable doubt


Petitioners mainly asseverate that their guilt was not shown beyond a peradventure of doubt and the State was unable to show that government funds were illegally released based on alleged ghost deliveries in conjunction with false or fake tally sheets and other documents which they admittedly signed.


We are not convinced.


Our Constitution unequivocally guarantees that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved.
22
 This sacred task unqualifiedly means proving the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Definitely, ""reasonable doubt"" is not mere guesswork whether or not the accused is guilty, but such uncertainty that ""a reasonable man may entertain after a fair review and consideration of the evidence."" Reasonable doubt is present when


after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidences, leaves the minds of the [judges] in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge; a certainty that convinces and directs the understanding, and satisfies the reason and judgment of those who are bound to act conscientiously upon it.
23


A thorough scrutiny of the records is imperative to determine whether or not reasonable doubt exists as to the guilt of accused Fernan, Jr. and Torrevillas.


Petitioners were charged with the complex crime of estafa through falsification of public documents as defined and penalized under Articles 318 and 171 in relation to Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, thus:


ART. 318. Other deceits. – The penalty of arresto mayor and a fine of not less than the amount of the damage caused and not more than twice such amount shall be imposed upon any person who shall defraud or damage another by any deceit not mentioned in the preceding articles of this chapter.


ART. 171. Falsification by public officer, employee; or notary or ecclesiastical minister. – The penalty of prision mayor and a fine not to exceed 5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:


x x x x


4. Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts;


ART. 48. Penalty for complex crimes. – When a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies, or when an offense is a necessary means for committing the other, the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed, the same to be applied in its maximum period.


The complex crime is pruned into the following essential elements:


For estafa




1. 
Deceit
: Deceit is a specie of fraud. It is actual fraud, and consists in any false representation or contrivance whereby one person overreaches and misleads another, to his hurt. There is deceit when one is misled, either by guile or trickery or by other means, to believe to be true what is really false.
24


2. 
Damage
: Damage may consist in the offended party being deprived of his money or property as a result of the defraudation, disturbance in property right, or temporary prejudice.
25




For falsification




1. That the offender is a public officer, employee, or notary public;


2. That he takes advantage of his official position;


3. That he falsifies a document by committing any of the acts defined under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code.
26




Before the SB, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated September 1, 1988 was entered into between the State and the accused with the following stipulations and admissions:




(1) To expedite the early termination of the instant cases and abbreviate the testimony of Mrs. Delia Preagido, the prosecution and the accused have agreed to reproduce and adopt as the testimony of Preagido in the instant cases, her previous testimonies in Criminal Cases Nos. 889, etc. (Mandaue City HED ’78 cases), on May 18 and 19, 1982 and in Criminal Cases Nos. 1446-1789, etc. (Danao City HED ’77 cases) on November 10, 1987 and March 14, 1988, both on direct and cross examination x x x without prejudice to whatever direct and/or cross examination question, that may be propounded by the Prosecution and the accused on said State witness, which questions will only be limited to the fake or irregular LAA’s and SACDC’s issued to Cebu I HED in 1977, the sale of such fake or irregular LAA’s and SACDC’s issued to Cebu I HED in 1977, the sale of such fake or irregular LAA’s and SACDC’s in said engineering district in the said year and the participation of the accused thereon;


(2) That in the event Mrs. Delia Preagido is presented to testify as a State witness in the instant cases without reproducing and adopting her previous testimonies in the Mandaue City HED ’78 and the Danao City HED ’77 cases, she will identify documents and exhibits which have been previously marked and identified by other prosecution witness x x x.


(3) That in the previous testimonies of Mrs. Delia Preagido in the Mandaue City HED ’78 and the Danao City HED ’77 cases, she identified twenty-six separate lists containing names of officials and employees of MPH, Regional Office No. VII, of the various Highways Engineering Districts in MPH, Region VII, and the MPH Central Office who have allegedly received money or various sums from 1977 to 1978 out of the proceeds or sales of fake LAA’s in 1977 and 1978 and, therefore, to obviate Mrs. Preagido’s previous testimony of these lists, the Prosecution hereby reproduces and adopts specifically such testimony and the markings of the lists, i.e., Exhibits ‘KKK’, ‘KKK-1’ to ‘KKK-25’ in the Mandaue City HED ’78 cases and Exhibits ‘0000’, ‘0000-1’ to ‘0000-25’ in the Danao City HED ’77 cases, substituted or re-marked accordingly as ‘Exhibits ‘LL’, ‘LL-1’ to ‘LL-25’ in the instant cases.
27




As a result of this MOA, the testimony of state witness Preagido on the modus operandi of the conspirators, or the unique and distinct method of procedure by which the malversation of public funds in Region VII of the MPH was perpetrated and accomplished, dealt a major blow to the defenses raised by petitioners. Preagido’s vital testimony, wherein she identified the methods, documents, exhibits, and other pertinent papers that led to the crafting of fake Letters of Advice of Allotment (LAAs),
28
 general vouchers, disbursement of funds for non-existent projects, general vouchers, and other documents, was not even successfully refuted or overturned by petitioners.


Preagido confirmed and admitted under oath that the illegal disbursement of public funds pertained to non-existent projects and was supported by fake LAAs, fake general vouchers, and other pertinent papers that were also falsified. The fake LAAs and general vouchers were, in turn, supported by signed tally sheets that pertained to alleged ghost deliveries of road construction materials for non-existent or illegal projects.


The fake tally sheets, delivery receipts, reports of inspection, requests for supplies and materials, and other related documents signed on separate occasions by petitioners, which were attached as supporting documents to corresponding general vouchers; the alleged amounts and quantities of road construction materials delivered; and the specific fake general vouchers, checks, and other pertinent documents issued which led to the illegal disbursement of funds are summarized as follows:
