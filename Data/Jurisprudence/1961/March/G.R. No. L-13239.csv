This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First instance of Manila, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:




WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered against the defendants Placido L. Mapa, J. Amado Araneta, Ma-ao Sugar Central Co., Inc. and Financing Corporation of the Philippines, sentencing them jointly and severally to pay the plaintiffs the following amounts:








(a)  S.E. TAIT .........................................................................




P121,783.94






Stephen P. Brankov and Lina Wasserman in substitution of Rose L. Harris ...........................................




118,786.43






Bernard E. Berkenkotter (executor of the estate of B. H. Berkenkotter) and W. Ick ..............................................




43,837.08






with interest thereon at the rate of six (6%) per cent per annum from October 13, 1953 when this suit was filed, until full payment; and 






(b)  Costs of suit.










This appeal is, however, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, for: (1) although the aggregate amount of the foregoing judgment is P284,407.45, this sum includes interest accrued before October 13, 1953, deducting which the total principal awarded would be P150,441.65 only; (2) the appeal raises questions of fact and no question of law which is within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of this Court; and (3) this case involves three (3) separate causes of actions, one in favor of S. E. Tait, for P64,467.66; another in favor of Rose L. Harris, for P62,910.66; and the third, in favor of H. B. Berkenkotter, jointly with W. Ick, for P23,063.38, all exclusive of interest (Republic Act No. 296, sections 17, as amended by Republic Act No. 2613, and 29; Go Bon Chait vs. Valmarida, L-4605. April 24, 1953; Samson vs. Andal, L-3439, July 31, 1951; A. Soriano y Cia vs. Jose, 47 O.G.

Pasicolan, L-13317, April 25, 1960; Cajilig, et al. vs. Co, L-12800, August 5, 1960).
