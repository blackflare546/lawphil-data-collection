CONCEPCION, 
J
.:


Petitioner Santiago Gancayco seeks the review of a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, requiring him to pay P16,860.31, plus surcharge and interest, by way of deficiency income tax for the year 1949.


On May 10, 1950, Gancayco filed his income tax return for the year 1949. Two (2) days later, respondent Collector of Internal Revenue issued the corresponding notice advising him that his income tax liability for that year amounted P9,793.62, which he paid on May 15, 1950. A year later, on May 14, 1951, respondent wrote the communication Exhibit C, notifying Gancayco, 
inter alia
, that, upon investigation, there was still due from him, a efficiency income tax for the year 1949, the sum of P29,554.05. Gancayco sought a reconsideration, which was part granted by respondent, who in a letter dated April 8, 1953 (Exhibit D), informed petitioner that his income tax defendant efficiency for 1949 amounted to P16,860.31. Gancayco urged another reconsideration (Exhibit O), but no action taken on this request, although he had sent several communications calling respondent's attention thereto.


On April 15, 1956, respondent issued a warrant of distraint and levy against the properties of Gancayco for the satisfaction of his deficiency income tax liability, and accordingly, the municipal treasurer of Catanauan, Quezon issued on May 29, 1956, a notice of sale of said property at public auction on June 19, 1956. Upon petition of Gancayco filed on June 16, 1956, the Court of Tax Appeal issued a resolution ordering the cancellation of the sale and directing that the same be readvertised at a future date, in accordance with the procedure established by the National Internal Revenue Code. Subsequently, or on June 22, 1956, Gancayco filed an amended petition praying that said Court:




(a) Issue a writ of preliminary injunction, enjoining the respondents from enforcing the collection of the alleged tax liability due from the petitioner through summary proceeding pending determination of the present case;


(b) After a review of the present case adjudge that the right of the government to enforce collection of any liability due on this account had already prescribed;


(c) That even assuming that prescription had not set in the objections of petitioner to the disallowance of the entertainment, representation and farming expenses be allowed; 


x x x           x x x           x x x




In his answer respondent admitted some allegations the amended petition, denied other allegations thereof an set up some special defenses. Thereafter Gancayco received from the municipal treasurer of Catanauan, Quezon, another notice of auction sale of his properties, to take place on August 29, 1956. On motion of Gancayco, the Court of Tax Appeals, by resolution dated August 27, 1956, ""cancelled"" the aforementioned sale and enjoined respondent and the municipal treasurer of Catanauan, Quezon, from proceeding with the same. After appropriate proceedings, the Court of Tax Appeals rendered, on November 14, 1957, the decision adverted to above.


Gancayco maintains that the right to collect the deficiency income tax in question is barred by the statute of limitations. In this connection, it should be noted, however, that there are two (2) civil remedies for the collection of internal revenue taxes, namely: (a) by distraint of personal property and levy upon real property; and (b) by ""judicial action"" (Commonwealth Act 456, section 316). The first may not be availed of except within three (3) years after the ""return is due or has been made ..."" (Tax Code, section 51 [d] ). After the expiration of said Period, income taxes may not be legally and validly collected by distraint and/or levy (Collector of Internal Revenue v. Avelino, L-9202, November 19, 1956; Collector of Internal Revenue v. Reyes, L-8685, January 31, 1957; Collector of Internal Revenue v. Zulueta, L-8840, February 8, 1957; Sambrano v. Court of Tax Appeals, L-8652, March 30, 1957). Gancayco's income tax return for 1949 was filed on May 10, 1950; so that the warrant of distraint and levy issued on May 15, 1956, long after the expiration of said three-year period, was illegal and void, and so was the attempt to sell his properties in pursuance of said warrant.


The ""judicial action"" mentioned in the Tax Code may be resorted to within five (5) years from the date the return has been filed, if there has been no assessment, or within five (5) years from the date of the assessment made within the statutory period, or within the period agreed upon, in writing, by the Collector of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer. before the expiration of said five-year period, or within such extension of said stipulated period as may have been agreed upon, in writing, made before the expiration of the period previously situated, except that in the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax or of a failure to file a return, the judicial action may be begun at any time within ten (10) years after the discovery of the falsity, fraud or omission (Sections 331 and 332 of the Tax Code). In the case at bar, respondent made three (3) assessments: (a) the original assessment of P9,793.62, made on May 12, 1950; (b) the first deficiency income tax assessment of May 14, 1951, for P29,554.05; and (c) the amended deficiency income tax assessment of April 8, 1953, for P16,860.31.


Gancayco argues that the five-year period for the judicial action should be counted from May 12, 1950, the date of the original assessment, because the income tax for 1949, he says, could have been collected from him since then. Said assessment was, however, not for the deficiency income tax involved in this proceedings, but for P9,793.62, which he paid forthwith. Hence, there never had been any cause for a judicial action against him, and, per force, no statute of limitations to speak of, in connection with said sum of P9,793.62.


Neither could said statute have begun to run from May 14, 1951, the date of the first deficiency income tax assessment or P29,554.05, because the same was, upon Gancayco's request, reconsidered or modified by the assessment made on April 8, 1953, for P16,860.31. Indeed, this last assessment is what Gancayco contested in the amended petition filed by him with the Court of Tax Appeals. The amount involved in such assessment which Gancayco refused to pay and respondent tried to collect by warrant of distraint and/or levy, is the one in issue between the parties. Hence, the five-year period aforementioned should be counted from April 8, 1953, so that the statute of limitations does not bar the present proceedings, instituted on April 12, 1956, if the same is a judicial action, as contemplated in section 316 of the Tax Code, which petitioner denies, upon the ground that




a. ""The Court of Tax Appeals does not have original jurisdiction to entertain an action for the collection of the tax due;


b. ""The proper party to commence the judicial action to collect the tax due is the government, and


c. ""The remedies provided by law for the collection of the tax are exclusive.""




Said Section 316 provides:




The civil remedies for the collection of internal revenue taxes, fees, or charges, and any increment thereto resulting from delinquency shall be (a) by distraint of goods, chattels, or effects, and other personal property of whatever character, including stocks and other securities, debts, credits, bank accounts, and interest in and rights to personal property, and by levy upon real property; and (b) by
 judicial action
. Either of these remedies or both simultaneously may be pursued in the discretion of the authorities charged with the collection of such taxes.


No exemption shall be allowed against the internal revenue taxes in any case.




Petitioner contends that the judicial action referred to in this provision is commenced by filing, with a court of first instance, of a complaint for the collection of taxes. This was true at the time of the approval of Commonwealth Act No. 456, on June 15, 1939. However, Republic Act No. 1125 has vested the Court of Tax Appeals, not only with exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of the Collector (now Commissioner) of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, like the one at bar, but, also, with authority to decide ""all cases involving disputed assessments of Internal Revenue taxes or customs duties pending determination before the court of first instance"" at the time of the approval of said Act, on June 16, 1954 (Section 22, Republic Act No. 1125). Moreover, this jurisdiction to decide all cases involving disputed assessments of internal revenue taxes and customs duties necessarily implies the power to authorize and sanction the collection of the taxes and duties involved in such assessments as may be upheld by the Court of Tax Appeals. At any rate, the same now has the authority formerly vested in courts of first instance to hear and decide cases involving disputed assessments of internal revenue taxes and customs duties. Inasmuch as those cases filed with courts of first instance constituted judicial actions, such is, likewise, the nature of the proceedings before the Court of Tax Appeals, insofar as sections 316 and 332 of the Tax Code are concerned.


The question whether the sum of P16,860.31 is due from Gancayco as deficiency income tax for 1949 hinges on the validity of his claim for deduction of two (2) items, namely: (a) for farming expenses, P27,459.00; and (b) for representation expenses, P8,933.45.


Section 30 of the Tax Code partly reads:




(a) Expenses:


(1) In General — All the 
ordinary 
and 
necessary 
expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in 
carrying on any trade or business
, including a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered; traveling expenses while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business; and rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession, for the purposes of the trade or business, of property 
to which the taxpayer has not taken or is not taking title
 or in which he has no equity. (Emphasis supplied.)




Referring to the item of P27,459, for farming expenses allegedly incurred by Gancayco, the decision appealed from has the following to say:




No evidence has been presented as to the nature of the said ""farming expenses"" other than the 
bare statement 
of petitioner that they were spent for the ""development and cultivation of (his) property"". 
No specification has been 
made as to the actual amount spent for purchase of tools, equipment or materials, or the amount spent for improvement. Respondent claims that the entire amount was spent exclusively for 
clearing and developing
 the farm which were 
necessary to place it in a productive state. It is not, therefore, an ordinary expense but a capitol expenditure
. Accordingly, it is not deductible but it may be amortized, in accordance with section 75 of Revenue Regulations No. 2, cited above. See also, section 31 of the Revenue Code which provides that in computing net income, no deduction shall in any case be allowed in respect of any amount paid out for 
new buildings or for permanent improvements
, or 
betterments
 made to 
increase the value 
of any property or estate. (Emphasis supplied.)




We concur in this view, which is a necessary consequence of section 31 of the Tax Code, pursuant to which:




(a) General Rule — In computing net income no deduction shall in 
any
 case be allowed in respect of —


(1) Personal, living, or family expenses;


(2) Any amount paid out for new buildings or for
 permanent improvements
, or 
betterments 
made to 
increase the value 
of any property or estate;


(3) Any amount expended in 
restoring 
property or in 
making good the exhaustion thereof 
for which an allowance is or has been made; or


(4) Premiums paid on any life insurance policy covering the life of any officer or employee, or any person financially interested in any trade or business carried on by the taxpayer, individual or corporate, when the taxpayer is directly or indirectly a beneficiary under such policy. (Emphasis supplied.)




Said view is, likewise, in accord with the consensus of the authorities on the subject.




Expenses incident to the acquisition of property follow the same rule as applied to payments made as direct consideration for the property. For example, commission paid in acquiring property are considered as representing part of the cost of the property acquired. The same treatment is to be accorded to amounts expended for maps, abstracts, legal opinions on titles, recording fees and surveys. Other non-deductible expenses include amounts paid in connection with geological explorations, 
development 
and subdividing of real estate; 
clearing and grading
; restoration of soil, drilling wells, architects's fees and similar types of expenditures. (4 Merten's Law of Federal Income Taxation, Sec. 25.20, pp. 348-349; see also sec. 75 of the income Regulation of the B.I.R.; Emphasis supplied.)


The cost of farm machinery, equipment and farm building represents a capital investment and is 
not 
an allowable deduction as an item of expense. Amounts expended in the 
development 
of farms, orchards, and ranches
 prior to the time when the productive state is reached 
may be regarded as investments of capital. (Merten's Law of Federal Income Taxation, 
supra
, sec. 25.108, p. 525.)


Expenses for 
clearing
 off and grading lots acquired is a 
capital
 expenditure, representing part of the cost of the land and was not deductible as an expense. (Liberty Banking Co. v. Heiner 37 F [2d] 703 [8AFTR 100111] [CCA 3rd]; The B.L. Marble Chair Company v. U.S., 15 AFTR 746).


An item of expenditure, in order to be deductible under this section of the statute providing for the deduction of 
ordinary 
and 
necessary 
business expenses, must fall 
squarely 
within the language of the statutory provision. This section is intended primarily, although not always necessarily, to cover expenditures of a 
recurring 
nature where the benefit derived from the payment is 
realized and exhausted within the taxable year
. Accordingly, if the result of the expenditure is the 
acquisition of an asset 
which has an economically useful life 
beyond the taxable year, no 
deduction of such payment may be obtained under the provisions of the statute. In such cases, to the extent that a deduction is allowable, it must be obtained under the provisions of the statute which permit deductions for amortization, depreciation, depletion or loss. (W.B. Harbeson Co. 24 BTA, 542; Clark Thread Co., 28 BTA 1128 aff'd 100 F [2d] 257 [CCA 3rd, 1938]; 4 Merten's Law of Federal Income Taxation, Sec. 25.17, pp. 337-338.)




Gancayco's claim for representation expenses aggregated P31,753.97, of which P22,820.52 was allowed, and P8,933.45 disallowed. Such disallowance is justified by the record, for, apart from the absence of receipts, invoices or vouchers of the expenditures in question, petitioner could not specify the items constituting the same, or when or on whom or on what they were incurred. The case of Cohan v. Commissioner, 39 F (2d) 540, cited by petitioner is not in point, because in that case there was evidence on the amounts spent and the persons entertained and the necessity of entertaining them, although there were no receipts an vouchers of the expenditures involved therein. Such is not the case of petitioner herein.


Being in accordance with the facts and law, the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is hereby affirmed therefore, with costs against petitioner Santiago Cancayco. It is so ordered.


Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera and Dizon, JJ.,
 concur.
