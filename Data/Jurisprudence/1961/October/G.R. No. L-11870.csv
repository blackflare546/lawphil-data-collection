CONCEPCION, 
J.:


Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal convicting appellants Paterno Cruz and Benito Cruz of ""rebellion with robbery with homicide,"" and appellant Fermin Tolentino of ""rebellion with arson, with murder and robbery."" The case is before us, the penalty imposed upon appellants being life imprisonment.


On or about November 23, 1953, the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal filed with the Court of First Instance of said province an information accusing said appellants, together with Elpidio Gantan (

I




That on or about March 20, 1951, at about 8:30 o'clock in the evening, in the municipality of Antipolo, province of Rizal, the herein accused BENITO CRUZ, leading some armed members of the ""Hukbong Mapagpalaya Ng Bayan"", including the accused herein PATERNO CRUZ, with intent of gain and for the purpose of procuring supplies for their organization, entered the residence of JOHN D.

HARDIE, took and carried away therefrom personal properties of material values consisting of a typewriter, a radio, several pieces of jewelry, books, clothings and other articles belonging to the latter amounting to Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00), more or less, and that before leaving the premises, the said BENITO CRUZ and PATERNO CRUZ, cooperating with one another and with the other members of the ""Hukbong Mapagpalaya Ng Bayan"" present thereat, tied the hands of JOHN D. HARDIE and DONALD CAPUANO and thereafter shot them to death together with IRENE W. HARDIE.

IX




That on or about August 26, 1950, in the municipality of Sta. Cruz, in the province of Laguna, about 100 armed HMBs with intent of gain and for the purpose of procuring supplies and other materials for the support and maintenance of the HMB organization, forcibly brought the cashier of the Provincial Treasury, Vicente Reventar, from his house to the Provincial Capitol and at the point of guns, forced him to open the treasury vault and therefrom, took money amounting to more than P80,000.00 consisting of different denomination including 50—, 100—, and 500 pesos bills. On this same occasion, these dissidents took and carried away typewriters and other office supplies belonging to the Republic of the Philippines, which they found in the Provincial Capitol building, and also burned and looted private buildings in the said municipality.




X




That in the various municipalities of Rizal and other provinces throughout the Philippines, the leaders, members and affiliates of the Communist Party of the Philippines and those of the ""Hukbong Mapagpalaya Ng Bayan"" have committed similar acts of murders, arsons and kidnappings.




It appears that in the evening of March 20, 1951, the Hardie Farm in the municipality of Antipolo, province of Rizal, was raided by Huks or members of the ""Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan"" (HMB), the armed force of the Communist Party of the Philippines, one of the aims of which is to overthrow by force of arms the Government of the Philippines. After ransacking the place taking therefrom a typewriter and a radio set, as well as stationary, clothings, foodstuffs and various other articles, the raiders tied the hands of John D. Hardie and his foreman Donald Capuano and shot them to death, together with Mrs. Hardie. Late that month, a combat patrol led by Capt. Conrado M. Cabagui of the 14th BCT, with the assistance of one Tomas Timbresa, as guide, located a Huk camp in the Sierra Madre Mountains. The agents of the law attacked and captured the camp, in which they found, among other objects, the radio set and the typewriter, Exhibits A and B, taken by the dissidents from the Hardies.


Moreover, on July 26, 1951, appellants Paterno Cruz and Benito Cruz, who are brothers, were apprehended in the barrio of San Rafael, Montalban, Rizal, together with several other persons, by a group of soldiers, under the command of Capt. Jose Carandang, 19th BCT. Upon investigation, said appellants made the affidavits Exhibits V, X, AA and Y in which they admitted being Huks. Benito Cruz further admitted having risen to the rank of Huk Commander and being known as Commander Silang, with 12 men under him which was confirmed by Paterno Cruz in his statement Exhibit Y. Moreover, Benito Cruz and some of his men indicated the place in the mountain where — as they allegedly defected from the HMB — they hid their arms, which were, accordingly recovered by the authorities. Again, Nicolas Lipunan and Tomas Timbresa testified that they were formerly members of the HMB; that, as such, they were detailed as ""cargadores"" to transport the goods and effects looted from the Hardie Farm, when it was raided by the Huks on March 20, 1951; that Benito Cruz and Paterno Cruz participated in said raid as members of the HMB; and that (according to Lipunan) Benito Cruz was one of the three (3) Huks who shot Mr. and Mrs. Hardie, and their manager Donald Capuano.


Benito Cruz and Paterno Cruz claimed, however, to have made and signed their aforementioned affidavits (Exhibits X and Y) under duress. Furthermore, Paterno Cruz denied having participated in the raid of the Hardie Farm or having any knowledge about the Huks. Said appellants, likewise, introduced the testimony of several residents of Montalban who vouchsafed for them as peaceful and law abiding citizens.


His Honor, the Trial Judge, found this evidence insufficient to offset the ""overwhelming evidence for the prosecution including the confession"" of said appellants. Indeed, the latter did not identify the soldiers that allegedly maltreated them and they showed no visible signs of maltreatment, apart from the fact that their aforementioned affidavits contain some exculpatory statements which are inconsistent with the allegation of duress. Besides, nothing in the records before us indicate a possible motive for any of the witnesses for the prosecution to falsely inculpate appellants Benito Cruz and Paterno Cruz. In short, we find no justification whatsoever for disturbing the conclusion reached on the lower court with respect to the participation of Benito Cruz and Paterno Cruz in the aforementioned raid of the Hardie Farm.


Upon the other hand, appellant Fermin Tolentino admitted being a Huk, although he denied having held any rank or responsible position in the organization or having adopted the name ""Commander Caviteño."" Furthermore, Onofre de Jesus — a member of the HMB from 1943 to 1953 when he surrendered, who had held responsible positions in the organization until he became commanding officer of FC-23 — testified that Tolentino had been Commanding Officer (CO), of the Flying Squad of FC-18 in 1948, CO of the Security Force under Linda Bie in 1949, CO of FC-25 in 1950, G-3 of FC-25 in 1951 and again CO of FC-25 in 1952; that during the raid of Orani, Bataan, on January 5, 1949, by the Huks, Tolentino was one of the officers who ordered the burning of houses therein; and that said appellant took part, also, in the Huk attack at Camp Makabulos, Tarlac, in August, 1950.


Similarly, Pablo Guinto, another former Huk, whose wife is Tolentino's aunt, testified that he (Guinto) formed part of the band of Huks led by Tolentino that attacked Culis, Hermosa, Bataan, on January 11, 1951; that a store was looted on that occasion; that a Chinese was then shot and killed by Tolentino; that he (Guinto) was likewise with the group of Huks, under the command of Tolentino, that raided Orani sometime in 1948 or 1949, Morong, Rizal, on April 21, 1951, and Hermosa, Bataan on December 2, 1951; and that Tolentino was the person responsible for the killing of one Valeriano and his son in the raid of Hermosa.


Again, Capt. Julio Dimagiba, commander of the detachment stationed at Dinalupihan, Bataan, in August, 1949, related how he recovered the dead bodies of Baldomero Simbulan, Antonio Cruz and an unidentified hunchback, who were victims of the Huk attack in said municipality on August 23, 1949, and found each corpse with a tag reading ""Ako ang pumatay, Commander Caviteño,"" the
 alias 
of appellant Tolentino, who was apprehended at an army check point in Grace Park, Caloocan, Rizal, on May 27, 1953. He then had a gunshot wound on the breast, and tried, at first, to hide his identity by giving a name different from his. Upon investigation, he later confessed to having been a Huk and made the statements Exhibits BB, CC, HH, II and JJ, in which he admitted having been the Commanding Officer of FC-25 and being known as Commander Caviteño. While under detention, in connection with this case, he escaped, but was recaptured somewhere in Pampanga.


During the trial, he testified that members of the army had maltreated him and then forced him to sign several statements. Besides, he denied the inscription found in the tags aforementioned, as well as having assumed the ""
alias 
Commander Caviteño"" or having been with any raiding party of the HMB. Lauro David and Remigio Soliman were, also, placed on the witness stand by appellant Tolentino, to corroborate the latter part of his testimony.


Commenting thereon, the lower court had the following to say:




The denial and explanation proffered by the accused and his witnesses cannot prevail over the clear and positive testimony of the State witnesses regarding his role in the several raids staged by the HUKs in the province of Bataan, but more particularly in the Makabulos massacre. On top of all these, the record is replete with at least eight confessions made by the accused Fermin Tolentino on separate occasions. In Exhibit ""BB"" taken by
 Sgt. Rejualos 
on May 27, 1953 and interpreted by
 Sgt. Quiambao, 
the accused declared that he joined the HMB as a private, then promoted to squad leader and later to staff officer, G-3 until he became commander of FC No. 25, Reco 2 from October, 1952 to December of the same year; that he was armed with a revolver, caliber 38; that his men were armed with thirty Garands and automatic carbines. Three days later, he gave another statement Exhibit ""00"" before
 Atty. Jose de la Fuente 
wherein he explained how his unit operated in ambushing the enemy; that during his membership, FC No. 25 had an encounter at Moron, Bataan in 1950 and at Pajo between Zambales and Bataan in 1951; that FC No. 25 had 100 men or 12 squads with Bataan as the area of operation. On June 3, 1953 the accused gave another statement, Exhibit ""PP"", wherein he admitted having joined the HMB as member in 1946 at Lubao, Pampanga; that his reason for joining was his disgust at his father's refusal to allow him to go to places like Manila; that he began his career under Commander Alexander of FC No. 18 (converted into FC No. 25). On July 14, 1953, he gave another statement, Exhibit ""HH"", before
 Lt. Estoque 
and interpreted by
 Roque Lapuz 
wherein he recounted offices held, the encounters mentioned in Exhibits ""BB"" and ""OO"" and added that in 1950, he studied two months in Reco 2 under Linda Bie as instructor; that he was G-3 of FC No. 25 from July, 1951 to August, 1952. He reiterated his previous statements in another confession on August 18, 1953, Exhibit ""II"".




We are fully in accord with this view. Needless to say, apart from his bare testimony, appellant Tolentino has not introduced any evidence on his alleged maltreatment by agents of the law, aside from the fact that the same is refuted by the exculpatory details contained in his aforementioned statements.


As stated in the brief for the Government, appellants herein are guilty of simple rebellion (People vs. Nava, L-9483, January 30, 1960; People vs. Hernandez, 52 Off. Gaz., 4612), inasmuch as the information alleges, and the records show that the acts imputed to them were performed as a means to commit the crime of rebellion and in furtherance thereof, although as Huk Commanders, appellants Benito Cruz and Fermin Tolentino fall under the first paragraph of Article 135 of the Revised Penal Code, which prescribes the penalty of
 prision mayor 
and a fine not exceeding P20,000, whereas appellant Paterno Cruz comes under the second paragraph of said article, which prescribes the penalty of
 prision mayor 
in its minimum period. Accordingly, the penalty meted out to appellants Benito Cruz and Fermin Tolentino should be reduced to ten (10) years of
 prision mayor, 
with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, and to pay each a fine of P10,000, and appellant Paterno Cruz should be sentenced to six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of
 prision mayor, 
with the accessory penalties prescribed by law.


Thus modified as to the designation of the crime committed and the penalties, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed in all other respects, with the proportionate part of the costs against said appellants. It is so ordered.
