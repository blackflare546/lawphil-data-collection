Office of the Solicitor General for plaintiff-appellee.


R E S O L U T I O N 




DIZON, 
J.:


In our resolution of May 12, 1961 we required the Solicitor General to file, within ten days from notice, an answer to the motion for reconsideration and/or new trial filed by appellant. After notice of said order had been served on the Solicitor General, we granted two motions for extension of time to file said answer filed by his office, the last of which extensions expired thirty days from July 3, 1961. In his last motion for extension the Solicitor General stated that he needed more time to prepare the answer because his office had requested the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary to investigate the alleged willful suppression by the Constabulary authorities in Davao of the affidavit or confession of Roman Catian, which contitutes the evidence allegedly newly discovered by appellant. To this date the Solicitor General has not filed the required answer.

In view of the long lapse of time since the motion for reconsideration and/or new trial was filed, the Solicitor General is hereby required to state for the record, within five days from notice hereof, whether or not he intends to file an answer to said motion. It is so ordered.


Bengzon. C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes and De Leon, JJ., concur.
