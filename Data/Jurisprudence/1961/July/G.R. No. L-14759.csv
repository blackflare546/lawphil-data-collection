quasi-judicial
 power. In view thereof, the Court hereby declares all the actuations of Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor over the subject matter of the claims of respondents Raymundo Polancos, Agustin Dinio and Luis Ramos null and void, the same having been rendered in excess of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion; and also declares that the writ of preliminary injunction issued in the order of January 15,1958 be made permanent for all legal purposes.
