Before this Court is a ""Motion for Partial Reconsideration of our decision affirming the dismissal ""with prejudice"" made by the Court of First Instance of Rizal on the herein movant's petition for naturalization. The motion prays that the said decision be reconsidered in the sense that petitioner may, if he so desires, file another application for naturalization in accordance with law, provided that he has all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications therefor.

alias

Wherefore, the decision of the lower court dismissing the petition for naturalization is affirmed, but with the modification that the dismissal shall be without prejudice, with costs against appellant.
