AQUINO, 
J.:


This case is about the examination of the books of account of Elizalde & Co., Inc. and its subsidiaries in connection with the testate estate of Joaquin M. Elizalde. The petitioner, a resident of New York, is a daughter of Joaquin. 


The examination was allowed in the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila dated February 13, 1979 for the limited purpose of Identifying the assets and excluding inquiry into evidence of possible frauds. The Court of Appeals sustained that order in its decision of July 16, 1981. The petitioner appealed to this Court. 


After submission of the briefs or on July 3, 1984, the private respondents filed a motion to dismiss the appeal with prejudice because the parties had reached an amicable settlement executed on May 16 and May 27, 1983 at Makati, Metro Manila and in New York. Among the stipulations of the agreement found in paragraph 3 thereof is that petitioner Cecilia Elizalde-Landegger should withdraw the instant petition for review. 


Petitioner's counsel in a manifestation dated July 27, 1984 offered no objection to the motion. 


WHEREFORE, this case is dismissed with prejudice and without costs. 


SO ORDERED. 


Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Plana and Gutierrez, Jr., JJ., concur. 


Abad Santos, J., reserves his vote.


Escolin and Cuevas, JJ., took no part.


Makasiar, J. (Chairman), is on leave.
