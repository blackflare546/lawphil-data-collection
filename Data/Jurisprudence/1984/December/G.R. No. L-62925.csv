No. 62925, which amount shall be applied in payment of the loan of P2,500.00 which MANILA BANK extended to each of the covered employees in December 1983. 


2. 	The foregoing payment shall be considered by TMBCEC, and TMBCEC expressly acknowledges and admits the said payment, as the full and complete settlement and satisfaction of any and all claims which the employees and TMBCEC may have against MANILA BANK for payment of the cost of living allowance under P.D. 1634 and for the unworked regular holidays. 


3. 	During the forthcoming negotiation for renewal of the existing 1983-1985 CBA, MANILA BANK shall favorably consider the grant of P90.00 per month cost of living allowance to the employees benefited by this Agreement.
