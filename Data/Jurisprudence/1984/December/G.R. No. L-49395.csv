ABAD SANTOS,

This is a petition to review a decision of the defunct Court of Appeals which affirmed the judgment of the trial court whereby: 




... judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff [E.R.

On November 3, 1969, Squibb and Green Valley entered into a letter agreement the text of which reads as follows: 




E.R. Squibb & Sons Philippine Corporation is pleased to appoint Green Valley Poultry & Allied Products, Inc. as a non-exclusive distributor for Squibb Veterinary Products, as recommended by Dr. Leoncio D. Rebong, Jr. and Dr. J.G. Cruz, Animal Health Division Sales Supervisor.

For goods delivered to Green Valley but unpaid, Squibb filed suit to collect. The trial court as aforesaid gave judgment in favor of Squibb which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 


In both the trial court and the Court of Appeals, the parties advanced their respective theories. 


Green Valley claimed that the contract with Squibb was a mere agency to sell; that it never purchased goods from Squibb; that the goods received were on consignment only with the obligation to turn over the proceeds, less its commission, or to return the goods ff not sold, and since it had sold the goods but had not been able to collect from the purchasers thereof, the action was premature. 


Upon the other hand, Squibb claimed that the contract was one of sale so that Green Valley was obligated to pay for the goods received upon the expiration of the 60-day credit period. 


Both courts below upheld the claim of Squibb that the agreement between the parties was a sales contract. 


We do not have to categorize the contract. Whether viewed as an agency to sell or as a contract of sale, the liability of Green Valley is indubitable. Adopting Green Valley's theory that the contract is an agency to sell, it is liable because it sold on credit without authority from its principal. The Civil Code has a provision exactly in point. It reads: 




Art.	 1905. The commission agent cannot, without the express or implied consent of the principal, sell on credit. Should he do so, the principal may demand from him payment in cash, but the commission agent shall be entitled to any interest or benefit, which may result from such sale. 




WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby dismissed; the judgment of the defunct Court of Appeals is affirmed with costs against the petitioner. 


SO ORDERED. 


Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Escolin and Cuevas, JJ., concur.


Makasiar (Chairman), reserves his vote.
