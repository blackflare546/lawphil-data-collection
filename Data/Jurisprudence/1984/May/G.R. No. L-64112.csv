THE NATIONAL HOUSING AUTHORITY, 
petitioner,

vs.


HONORABLE OTILIO ABAYA, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, National Region, Branch CLIV (154) and UNION CHEMICALS, INC., 
respondents.
 


Luis Vera Cruz for petitioner.


The Solicitor General for respondents. 




FERNANDO, 
C.J.:


This petition for certiorari and mandamus was filed by the National Housing Authority against an order of respondent Judge Otilio Abaya of the National Capital Region with the Union Chemicals, Inc. as private respondent. The order complained of excluded from an expropriation proceeding certain areas to ""be devoted exclusively to the fulfillment by Union Chemicals of its contractual obligation to its employees in accordance with the approval by the Human Settlement Regulatory Commission, Ministry of Human Settlement.""

 Petitioner posed the issue thus: ""May a landowner whose properties are the subject of expropriation proceedings seek the exclusion of the same from the said proceedings and evade condemnation of his properties by merely representing that said properties 
are also to be devoted by him
 to a public purpose? In the case at bar, such a defense was raised. And this was done one year after expropriation proceedings were commenced by the petitioner. Nonetheless, the trial court gave its properties from coverage of the expropriation proceedings — clearly, in grave abuse of discretion.""

This Court required respondents to comment. Such Comment was submitted by private respondent. At the outset, it referred to what was referred to as inaccuracies in the statement of facts in the petition and added: ""The records show that the particular issue of whether a property already devoted to a public purpose can still be expropriated for the same public purpose is not an 'afterthought' and that it was not 'raised 
one year
 after expropriation proceedings were commenced.' ""

 I It then argued that respondent Judge acted well within his jurisdiction and with sound exercise of discretion in excluding the subject properties from the expropriation proceedings and that certiorari is not the proper remedy. 


The Comment was considered as the Answer; the petition was given due course; and the parties required to submit their memoranda. Thereafter, upon their being filed, the petition was ready for deliberation and subsequently for decision. 


On May 22, 1984, petitioner and private respondent submitted a Compromise Agreement dated May 10, 1984. They stipulated and agreed on the following: ""1. On October 30, 1980, Petitioner instituted Civil Case No. 39068, entitled

The petitioner shall provide respondent UCI an 8-meter access and right-of-way free of charge in consideration of the exchange of the said properties of respondent UCI with the property of the petitioner; 9. The parties shall retain titles to their respective areas being used by the National Power Corporation for power transmission line, and they shall pursue their respective claims against the National Power Corporation for payment of the right-of-way for its power transmission line; 10. The location plan reflecting and embodying the detailed agreement mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraphs, as wen as the relative positions of the affected land area, is attached as Annex 'C' and made integral part hereof; 11. The cost of survey for the segregation of the areas subject of the exchange, shall be charged to and shouldered by respondent UCI All other necessary and incidental expenses, such as registration and other legal fees, shall be equally shouldered by the parties; 12. The parties agree to waive all claims they have against each other in Civil Case No. 39068, and they further agree that this Compromise Agreement is a final settlement of the said claims; 13. The parties agree to faithfully comply with the foregoing terms and conditions and after same have been approved by this Honorable Court, the Compromise Agreement shall partake of the nature of court judgment that any violations thereof by any party shall entitle the aggrieved party to a writ of execution of this Compromise Agreement.
