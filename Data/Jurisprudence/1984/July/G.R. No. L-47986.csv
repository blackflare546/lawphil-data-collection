AQUINO, 
J.:


This case is about the rescission of a deed of exchange. In a 1963 document, Aquiline P. Marin assigned to the brothers Manuel P. Armada and Ariston P. Armada her hereditary share in the testate estate of her deceased mother, 
Monica Pacificar 
Vda. de Provido, situated in January, Iloilo 
in exchange for 
the land of the Armadas located in Cotabato covered by TCT No. 7252 and other properties in that province. 


The exchange would be rescindible when it is definitely ascertained that the parties have respectively no right to the properties sought to be exchanged. The exchange did not mean that the parties were definitely entitled to the properties being exchanged but it was executed ""in anticipation of a declaration of said right"". The deed of exchange reads as follows:

As background, it should be stated that the Armadas and Mrs. Marin are first cousins. The Armadas in 1963 expected to inherit some lots in 
General Santos 
City from their uncle, 
Proceso Pacificar
, who died in 1954. Mrs. Marin, who resided in Koronadal, Cotabato, had hereditary rights in the estates of her parents, the deceased spouses, Francisco Provido and Monica Pacificar, of 
Janiuay Iloilo
, where died in 1938 and 1960, respectively. Manuel P. Armada resided in 
Janiuay
. 


In 1963, when the deed of exchange was executed, the estate of Proceso Pacificar, in which the Armadas expected to inherit a part, had been adjudicated to Soledad Pronido- Elevencionado a sister of Mrs. Marin and a first cousin also of the Armadas. Soledad claimed to be the sole heir of Proceso. So, the Armadas and the other heirs had to sue Soledad. 


The protracted litigation ended in a compromise in 1976 when the Armadas were awarded Lots 906-A-2 and 906-A-3, located in Barrio lagao, General Santos City with a total area of 8,124 
square meters
, Mrs. Marin never possessed these two lots. They were supposed to be exchange for her 
proindiviso share 
in her parents' estate in Janiuay.


Did Mrs. Marin inherit actually anything from her parents? The answer is nothing. She chose to forget the deed. Her conduct showed that she considered herself not bound by it. Five years after that deed, or on November 14, 1968, she agreed to 
convey to her sister, Aurora Provido-Collado
, her interest in two lots in January in payment of her obligation amounting to P1,700. 


Then, in the extra-judicial partition of her parents' estate on 
June 25, 1977 
(where the instant case for rescission was already pending), her share with a total area of 
9,010 square meters
, was formally adjudicated to Aurora. It was stated therein that Mrs. Marin ""has waived, renounced and quit-claimed her share"" in favor of Aurora. As already stated, that share was supposed to be exchanged for the two lots in General Santos City which the Armadas received in 1976 after a pestiferous litigation. 


The Armadas filed the instant rescissory action against Mrs. Marin on December 7, 1976. They overlooked the fact that Ariston P. Armada was not bound at all by the deed since Manuel. who signed the deed for aim, had no authority to do so Manuel was not the attorney-in-fact of Ariston (See Art. 1403 [1], Civil Code). 


There was no trial. The case was submitted on the pleadings. The sole issue resolved by the trial court was prescription. It held that the Armadas' action had not prescribed because their right to rescind accrued only in 1976 when they discovered that Mrs. Marin could not perform her obligation under the deed since she had assigned her hereditary rights to her sister. 


Judge Midpantao L. Adil rescinded the deed of exchange, ordered restitution of whatever might have been received by 

Mrs. Marin, released the Armadas from their obligation under said deed and ordered Mrs. Marin to pay the Armadas P10,000 as moral and exemplary damages and P3,000 as attorney's fees. Mrs. Marin appealed to this Court on legal issues (L-49018). 


Judge Adil issued an order of execution pending appeal which Mrs. Marin assailed by certiorari in this Court. The enforcement of the execution was restrained by this Court (L-47986). The two related cases have been consolidated. 


It is evident from the deed of exchange that the intention of the parties relative to the lots, which are the objects of the exchange, cannot be definitely ascertained. We hold that this circumstance renders the exchange void or inexistent (Art. 1378, 2nd par. and Art. 1409 [6], Civil Code). 


Thus, as already noted, it is provided in paragraph 7 that the deed should not be construed as an acknowledgment by the Armadas and Mrs. Marin that they are entitled to the properties involved therein and that it was executed 
""in anticipation of a declaration of"" their rights to the properties. 


Then, it is stipulated in paragraph 8 that the parties should take possession and make use of the properties involved in the deed. 


The two provisions are irreconcilable because paragraph contemplates that the properties are still to be awarded or adjudicated to the parties whereas paragraph 8 envisages a situation where the parties have already control and possession thereof. 


It should be noted that in paragraph 7 of Mrs. Marin's answer with affirmative defense she avers therein that her 1968 agreement with her sister means that she would convey her properties to the latter (Aurora) when the Armadas should be ""adjudged to be without rights or interests to any properties in General Santos City"" (p. 47, Rollo of L-49018). 
Such a qualifications is not found in her agreement with her sister. 


The instant rescissory action may be treated as an action to declare void the deed of exchange. The action to declare the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe (Art. 1410, Civil Code). 


The properties covered by the deed should have been specified and described. A perusal of the deed gives the impression that it involves many properties. In reality, it refers only to 8,124 square meters of land, which the Armadas would inherit from their uncle in General Santos City, and to the 9,000 square meters representing the 
proindiviso share 
of Mrs. Marin in her parents' estate. As we have seen, Mrs. Marin rendered impossible the performance of her obligation under the deed. 


Because of that impossibility, the Armadas could rescind 
extrajudicially 
the deed of exchange (Art. 1191 Civil Code; 4 Tolentino, civil Code, 1973 Ed., pp. 171-172). If Mrs. Marin should sue the Armadas, her action would be barred under the rule of 
exceptio non adimpleti contractus 
(plaintiff is not entitled to sue because he has not performed his part of the agreement). 


As no evidence was presented in this case, we cannot sustain the award of P10,000 as moral and exemplary damages and P3,000 as attorney's fees. 


WHEREFORE, the trial court's judgment and the order of execution pending appeal are set aside. The deed of exchange is hereby declared void and inexistent. The annotation thereof on TCT Nos. 10833 and 10834 should be cancelled. The Armadas' claim for damages and attorney's fees is denied. Aquilina Provido-Mrin's counterclaim is dismissed. No costs. 


SO ORDERED.
