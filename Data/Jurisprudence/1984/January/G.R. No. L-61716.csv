THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, 
plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


MARCIALITO BARCENILLA alias Marcial Quizon, 
accused-appellant.
 


The Solicitor General for plaintiff-appellee. 


Baltazar A. Sator for accused-appellant. 




ABAD SANTOS, 
J
.:


This is an appeal from the judgment of the defunct Court of First Instance of Surigao del Sur in Criminal Case No. L-524. The condemnatory portion of the judgment reads as follows: 




In view of the foregoing considerations, the court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, and there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances attending the commission of the crime, hereby sentences said accused to the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua;
 to pay Veronica Licup and her parents the amount of Ten Thousand Pesos (Pl00,000.00) as moral damages for the shame and humiliation they suffered; without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs. (Decision, P. 9.) 




The People's version of the facts is to the effect that: 




At about 8:00 o'clock in the evening of April 7, 1978, complainant Veronica Licup, a comely girl of fourteen years, together with her friends Ginging, Shirley, Susan and Dodong, went to the One Eleven Night Club at Barangay Mangagoy, Bislig, Surigao del Sur. At the nightclub, Veronica to appellant, a combo player in said nightclub (tsn, Jan. 17, 1979, pp. 7-10.)


At around 11:30 p.m., Veronica together with Glenda, appellant and a friend of appellant by the name of Jerry left the nightclub. Veronica's original companions left earlier without Veronica's knowledge. It was Veronica's intention to go home but since it was almost midnight, curfew was still imposed, and her house was quite far, Glenda and appellant suggested that Veronica pass the night with the lady boarders of appellant at Dominitz building in said barangay. Veronica insisted on going home but because nobody was willing to accompany her home, she agreed (tsn., Jan. 17, 1979, pp. 10-13.)


Veronica, with appellant and Jerry, then proceeded to appellant's boarding house. The three went up to the third floor of the boarding house where the lady boarders sleep. While waiting for lady boarders, Veronica sat on the stairs. After several minutes and the lady boarders have not yet arrived, appellant and Jerry persuaded Veronica to enter a room which turned out to be appellant's room. Jerry and appellant first cleaned the room. When Veronica entered the room, Jerry left. Veronica expected the appellant to leave likewise, but the latter stayed (tsn., Jan. 17, 1979, pp. 13-16).


Moments later, Veronica was appellant drink wine direct from the bottle. Sensing danger, Veronica immediately grabbed her sandals and tried to get out of the room but found the door locked from outside (tsn., Jan. 17, 1979, pp. 16-19).


Appellant then grabbed Veronica's hair and poked a knife at her back. Appellant told Veronica to lie down on the bed, threatening to kill her if she refused. Veronica struggled but was eventually forced to lied down on the bed. Appellant tried to remove her shirt but Veronica continued her struggle. Appellant then gave Veronica a blow on her nape rendering her unconscious. When Veronica regained consciousness, appellant was already on top of her. Veronica made a final struggle but appellant through force and intimidation, succeeded eventually in consummating the sexual act. After satisfying his lust, appellant remained on top of Veronica and continued threatening her. Again, Veronica resisted and struggled to free herself but appellant punched her again. Veronica agaian lost consciousness. Appellant then ravished Veronica for the second time (tsn., Jan. 17, 1979, pp. 20-26; tsn., July 9, 1979, pp. 84-86).


At around 5:00 o'clock in the morning of April 8, 1978, Teodora Licup, Veronica's mother, accompanied by Glenda Fernandez, found Veronica crying inside appellant's room. Veronica told her mother that she was sexually abused by appellant. Teodora Licup then brought Veronica home and the latter related to her father and brothers what happened to her. A family conference decided that a case be filed against appellant. Veronica and her parents then went to the police station to report the incident. Thereafter, Veronica was accompanied to the rural health physician of Bislig, Surigao del Norte where she was examined (tsn., March 18, 1981, pp. 8-13). 


The finding of Dr. Cesar G. Salvanera, the rural health physician, showed the following: 


FINDINGS 


Fairly develop, fairly nourished, afebrile coherent ambulatory female adult. The breast are fully developed, hemispherical in shape, firm, the nipples are prominent surrounded by brownish areols.


EXTERNAL EXAMINATION 


Contusions-abrasions, back, posterior lateral aspect, right and left sides. 


INTERNAL EXAMINATION:

Hymenal orifice admits 8.6 cm. circumference bottle with moderate resistance. Vaginal canal moderately tight. The rugesities of the vaginal canal are prominent. 


CONCLUSION: 


Physical virginity lost. (Exhibit ""B"" brief, pp. 2-5.) 




The appellant admits that he had sexual congress twice with Veronica in his room on the night of April 7, 1979, but claims this they were done with her consent for they were already sweethearts since one month before. 


In assailing the decision of the trial court, the appellant makes no less than twelve assignments of error but all of them raise but one issue: who is telling the truth â€” Veronica or the appellant In such a case it is worth repeating that ""We are not disposed to discard the appreciation of the evidence by the court 
a quo 
because it was in a peculiar position to do so having personally seen the witnesses testify and their demeanor while doing so."" (People vs. Malate, L-40791, Sept. 11, 1982; 116 SCRA 487, 492.) 


The sexual acts were consummated in a locked room whose only occupants were the appellant and Veronica. Under the circumstances, the only persons who could have testified directly on the matter would be Veronica and the appellant. 


When Veronica testified on January 17, 1979, she was already 15 years old. (Exhibit C-2 shows that she was born on May 31, 1963; also testimony of her mother on page 184 of the TSN.) She narrated that on April 7, 1978, she went to the One Eleven Night Club with some friends where she met the appellant for the first time. Because her companions had left ahead, Veronica was persuaded to sleep at the boarding house for women owned by the appellant. This is what happened at the boarding house according to Veronica:

Q 	You did not get my question. When he was on top of you, will you tell the Honorable Court what did he do to you while he was on top of you after regaining consciousness?

Teodora Licup, Veronica's mother, testified that Veronica did not come home in the evening of April 7, 1978, so she presumed that Veronica had slept at the Andres Soriano Memorial Hospital; that when she went to the hospital the next day, she discovered that Veronica was not there; and that from Glenda she learned that Veronica had spent the night at the appellant's place. Part of Teodora's testimony follows: 








A 	We went up the third floor and I heard somebody crying. And I was already apprehensive that it was my daughter.


Q 	When you heard somebody crying on the third floor and you were apprehensive that it was your daughter, what did you do, if any? 


A 	I knocked the door louder and it opened. 


Q	After you knocked the door, what transpired? 


A 	The rigor opened and I saw my daughter crying and in disarray.


ATTY. VIOLA: 	


	At tills juncture, your Honor please, I just want to make of record that were the mother is testifying in connection with the search of her daughter, she is crying in open Court. 


COURT: 


	Proceed. 


ATTY. VIOLA 


Q 	What did you do, if any, after you saw your daughter crying and in disarray 


WITNESS: 


A 	I immediately embraced her and asked her why she did not go home. 


Q 	And what did she tell you, if any?


A 	She told me she was forced and sexually abused by Marcial Quizon. 


Q 	Will you describe to the Honorable Court the situation of your daughter Veronica Licup when you saw her and where was she at that time? 


A 	She was on the floor. 


Q 	What was her position on the floor?


A 	She was semi-seated.


Q 	What about her attire or clothes, what did you observe?


A 	I could not recall sir. 


Q	When she told you that she was abused by Marcial Quizon, what did you do, if any?


A 	I also confronted him and he denied. 


Q 	Was Marcial Quizon inside the room? 


A 	Yes, sir, (TSN, pp. 189-190.) 








Veronica's claim that she was raped is corroborated not only by the circumstantial evidence given by her mother, 
supra
, but also by the testimony of Dr. Cesar G. Salvanera who examined Veronica on April 10, 1978, and confirmed his statement in Exhibit B that she had ""Contusions abrasions, back, posterolateral aspect, right and left sides (Expedients, p. 14.) 


To prove that they had been sweethearts and that tulle fornication was by mutual consent, the appellant submitted a small ID photo (Exhibit 3) of Veronica with the following words at the back: ""Mar, Ano ang pag-ibig? Ronette The statement is not dated. It could have been written before April 7, 1978, in which case Veronica could not have met the appellant for the first time on that date; or it could have been written after April 7, 1978 â€” a supposition not altogether unfounded as will be seen below. At any rate, We agree with the trial court's evaluation of the exhibit that: 




This piece of evidence does not indicate that accused and complainant are sweethearts. The dedication at the back of said picture does not convey any expression of love coming from complainant whose nickname is ""Rennet', to said accused. The expression at the back of the picture is just a question about the meaning of love. (Decision, p. 6.) 


The appellant also submitted a letter (Exhibit 4) dated April 24, 1978, or 17 days after the incident, written by Veronica to him which states, among other things, ""Alam mo miss na rin kita kaya lang wala na tayong magawa. "" 




On its face, Exhibit 4 gives credence to the appellant's defense. But Veronica gave a satisfactory explanation by narrating the circumstances which attended the writing of the letter. She said: 








ATTY. EMUSLAN 


Q 	This Exh. 4 of the defense which you claimed was written by you, will you please tell the Honorable Court the circumstances why you wrote this letter? 


WITNESS: 


A	Beforehand, the friends of Marcial the cousins, the parents and even the sister of Marcial came to the house and they convinced me that I got married with Marcial And also they were bringing a friend of ours by the name of Glenda who was also convincing me that we got married. But I did not think about it first. And after the second time that they convinced me, I was convinced to agree to what they want because I fear that I might get pregnant and for what the shame I had and my honor, and all the people knew what happened to me. So I agreed and I knew that my parents would not agree to it. So Glenda was telling me to write a letter for Marcial but it would just be seen for my parents, not to be given to anybody or to Marcial But when I wrote this as she told me what to write, I knew that the letter was not given to my parents but they let the people read about my letter and they made me a laughing stock. (TSN, pp. 165-166.) 








Anent Exhibit 4, We agree with the trial court's assessment of the same as follows: 




Considering the tender age of complainant and her state of mind at the time she wrote said letter (EXIL 4), complainant must have been swayed by the advice of her friend, Glenda Fernandez, and accused's relatives, that said letter would ease if not solve her predicament then. 


The court believes that the tenor of said letter was framed by Glenda Fernandez, a close friend of complainant, to whom she reposed trust and confidence at that time when she needed advice most. She could not rely on her parents' advice because she committed a rash act which her parents did not take lightly, for as a matter of fact, they were angry at her. Thus, she had to seek for help from her close friends, one of them being Glenda. 


Besides, said letter (Exh. 4) dated April 24, 1978 was written after the incident on April 7, 1978. It does not show prior close relationship between complainant and the accused. (Decision, pp. 67.) 




In the light of the foregoing, We hold that the errors attributed to the trial court are not justified. 


WHEREFORE, the judgment of the court 
a quo 
is affirmed
 in toto. 
Costs against the appellant. 


SO ORDERED. 


Makasiar (Chairman), Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, De Castro and Escolin, JJ., concur.
