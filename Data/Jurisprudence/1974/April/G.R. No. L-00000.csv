That failure on the part of petitioner MARIANO MABASA to pay the second installment of P20,000.00 on or before June 20, 1974, shall make the full balance of the obligation due and demandable with interest thereon at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from date of default until fully paid and shall entitle the respondent FILIPINAS INTERLINK, INC., to a WRIT OF EXECUTION to enforce its rights.


(b)	Petitioner PAULINO CHANG shall pay respondent FILIPINAS INTERLINK, INC., the sum of EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND (P81,000.00) PESOS, in the following manner:

That failure on the part of petitioner PAULINO CHANG to pay three (3) monthly installments shall make the remaining balance due and demandable with interest thereon at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from date of default until fully paid and shall entitle the respondent FILIPINAS INTERLINK, INC., to a WRIT OF EXECUTION to enforce its rights.


That the President, Mr. Francisco Calinawan of the respondent (Filipinos Interlink, Inc.) pursuant to Board Resolution dated March 23, 1974, is authorized to sign this Compromise Agreement.


That this Compromise Agreement cancels and declares null and void the Compromise Agreement submitted in the Court of First Instance dated May 29, 1970, entitled ""FILIPINAS INTERLINK, INC., ET AL., versus MARIANO MABASA, ET AL.,"" and that respondent (Filipinas Interlink, Inc.) agrees that this Compromise Agreement is a complete and full satisfaction of its claim against the respondents (Mariano Mabasa and Paulino Chang) in Civil Cases Nos. 12776 and CA-G.R. No. 48718-R.


That petitioners (Mariano Mabasa and Paulino Chang) agree to dismiss their counterclaims against the respondent (Filipinas Interlink, Inc.)
