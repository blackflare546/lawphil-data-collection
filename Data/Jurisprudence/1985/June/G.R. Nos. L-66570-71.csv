(pages 120-121., rollo) 




Evidence shows that about four o'clock in the afternoon of March 7, 1981 appellants Diodato Parilla, Diosdado Tuscano and Gaudencio Morabe, together with Pabling Tuscano, Zosimo Tuscano and Victorino Dazo, armed with long boloes and without warning, entered the house of spouses Restituto and Josefina Superales in barangay Maca-alang, Dagami, Leyte and, thereafter, assaulted, hacked and stabbed the surprised spouses Restituto and Josefina Superales and their four-month old son, Joel, then held by Josefina. At the time, Fe Caidic and her mother, Emerenciana Lagahit, were in the house and upon seeing what had just happened, jumped out through the kitchen door and hid in a cliff ten meters away from the house. From the cliff, Fe Caidic saw appellants and their co-accused Zosimo Tuscano, Pabling Tuscano and Victorino Dazo still hacking the Superales and Joel. Thereafter, Pabling Tuscano remarked: ""they are dead"" and left. 


Rosita Tragia, a neighbor of the Superales, heard cries of help from Josefina. She rushed to the victims' house where she saw Restituto and Josefina lying prostrate on the floor, and Joel, covered with blood and held by the mother, crying. 


Rosita brought Joel to the house of Sofronio Superales for treatment. The next day, Joel was transferred to the Burauen General Hospital for treatment by Dr. Amparo Villanueva who issued a medical certificate certifying that the child sustained two (2) incised wounds, two (2) linear abrasions and contusions on the left arm. She testified that considering the age of the child, 4-months old, he would have died if medical assistance were not given him. 


The remains of spouses Restituto and Josefina Superales were brought by the police to the municipal health center of Burauen, Leyte and examined by Municipal Health Officer, Dr. Dionisio Conde. Dr. Conde certified that Josefina sustained four (4) wounds, while Restituto suffered thirteen (13) wounds, which caused their instant death. 


Two informations were filed against accused Diodato Parilla, Diosdado Tuscano, Gaudencio Morabe, Pabling Tuscano, Zosimo Tuscano and Victorino Dazo for the crimes of frustrated murder and double murder. Appellants Diodato Parilla, Diosdado Tuscano and Gaudencio Morabe were arrested, tried and convicted by the trial court. The other accused: Pabling Tuscano, Zosimo Tuscano and Victorino Dazo have not yet been apprehended. 


The defense of appellants Diosdado Tuscano and Gaudencio Morabe is denial. Both claimed that about four o'clock in the afternoon of March 7, 1981 they were within the vicinity of the house of the deceased and, upon hearing cries of help coming from said house, they ran to the place led by barangay captain Pedro Tragia. Upon reaching the yard of the victims, they saw Pabling Tuscano coming out from said house, holding a bolo with blood stains. They also saw Diodato Parilla somewhere in the yard, also holding a drawn bolo. Frightened upon seeing Pabling Tuscano who proceeded to hack banana plants in the yard, they all ran away and went back to the house of the barangay captain. 


Appellant Diodato Parilla, on the other hand, averred that he had come from Tacloban, carrying some rice when he heard a commotion in the house of Enrique Superales, near the house of Restituto and Josefina Superales. Someone remarked that he would be killed also. Scared, he left the rice he was carrying and ran away. 


The denial of appellants can not prevail over their positive Identification by prosecution witnesses as the perpetrators of the crimes charged. Hereunder is the testimony of Fe Caidicâ€”

Q	If he is in Court now will you please point to him?

	(TSN, April 6, 1983 hearing. pages 7, 9-11). 








No improper motive was adduced by the defense to discredit the testimonies of Caidic and Tragia. It can be relied upon that these witnesses testified on what had really happened as they saw it. Well settled is the rule that where clear and positive testimony was made by state witnesses regarding the participation of the accused, their denial and explanation cannot prevail over such evidence. 


The factual findings of the trial court which had better opportunity to observe the demeanor and truthfulness of the witnesses, are entitled to great weight in assessing matters of credibility. In the case at bar, it concluded: 


After a closer perusal and thorough appreciation of the evidence, this Court has reached its considered opinion that the accused Diosdado Tuscano, Diodato Parilla and Gaudencio Morabe are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Frustrated Murder (Crim. Case No. Bn-1849) and Double Murder (Crim. Case No. Bn-1850) with the qualifying circumstances of superior strength and the generic aggravating circumstances of dwelling and treachery, and (in Crim. Case No. Bn-1849) the aggravating circumstances of disregard to the age of the offended party, Joel Superales, who was only four (4) months old. In Crim. Case No. Bn-1850, the killing of Josefina Eslaban Superales is also with the aggravating circumstances of disregard to the sex of the offended party. (p. 120, rollo). 


WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. BN-1949 where the victim is Joel Superales, the judgment against appellants Diodato Parilla, Diosdado Tuscano and Gaudencio Morabe is hereby affirmed in toto. 


In Criminal Case No. BN-1850, for lack of the necessary votes, said appellants are hereby sentenced each to suffer 
reclusion perpetua
 for the death of Restituto Superales; and, another 
reclusion perpetua 
for the death of Josefina Superales. Further, they are to indemnify jointly and severally, the heirs of Restituto Superales in the sum of P30,000.00 and the heirs of Josefina Superales, another sum of P30,000.00. With costs. 


SO ORDERED.
