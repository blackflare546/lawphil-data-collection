GUTIERREZ, JR., 
J.:


This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, 7th Judicial Region, Branch XII which convicted Reynaldo Caitor and Daniel R. Mercado of the crime of murder. 


The information dated March 17, 1983, charged Reynaldo M. Caitor, Daniel R. Mercado, Federico L. Alazas, Victor Embuscado, Pepoy Embuscado and Francisco Santosidad with the crime of murder, as follows: 






That on or about the 10th day of March, 1983, at about 10:15 a.m., in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, conniving and confederating together with Pepoy Embuscado, Victor Embuscado and John Doe, who are still at large and who will be prosecuted separately as soon as apprehended, and mutually helping one another, one of whom was armed with a firearm, with deliberate intent, with treachery and evident premeditation, with intent to kill, did then and there attack, assault and use personal violence upon one Bashier Majid by giving fistic blows and shooting said Bashier Majid on different parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon him the following injuries: 


HEMORRHAGE, SEVERE, SECONDARY TO GUNSHOT WOUND, 


as a consequence of which said Bashier Majid died instantaneously. 


Contrary to law. 






When arraigned Reynaldo Caitor, Daniel Mercado, Federico Alazas, and Francisco Santosidad pleaded not guilty. Pepoy Embuscado and Victor Embuscado evaded arrest and were still at large at the time of the trial. 


The evidence for the prosecution is summarized in the decision of the lower court as follows: 






At about 9:30 o'clock in the morning of March 10, 1983, Felicidad Baybayanon, a fruit vendor, was tending to her fruit store which was on a pushcart parked just a few meters from Gate No. 4 of the Southwestern University, while Marlon Guangko was watching his billiard pool which was near the pushcart of Baybayanon. There were students playing billiard pool and there were others who sat on the pushcart eating chicos bought from Baybayanon's fruit stand. One of the students eating chicos who was sitting on the pushcart was Bashier Majid, a Med-Tech student of Southwestern University. A little later, Benjamin Fernandez arrived coming from his house which is just about 17 meters away from Gate No. 4. At first, he watched the billiard pool game. He saw Bashier Majid sitting on the pushcart which served as a fruit store of Baybayanon. From where he stood, Benjamin Fernandez noticed accused Victor Embuscado and accused Francisco Santosidad at the entrance of Gate No. 4 watching the students entering the gate or coming out of it. He knew Victor Embuscado to be a member of the security force of SWU. Fernandez then proceeded to Gate No. 4 where Victor Embuscado and Santosidad were, and at this point, he saw accused Pepoy Embuscado, Reynaldo Caitor and Daniel Mercado conversing with each other at the lobby of the Engineering Building about six meters away from Gate No. 4. He knew that these three accused were members of the Security Force of SWU. A little later, these three accused walked towards Gate No. 4 and Pepoy Embuscado told Caitor and Mercado saying: ""That one, that one in stripe blue"" at the same time pointing to Bashier Majid who was then wearing a striped blue shirt. Then Mercado and Caitor answered: ""Is he the one wearing striped blue?"". When Reynaldo Caitor (also known as ""Boy Hiyong"") saw Benjamin Fernandez, Caitor said: ""Jie (Meaning Benjamin Fernandez), is he your friend?"" (Caitor pointing to Bashier Majid) and Fernandez answered that he (meaning Majid) is a friend of Bagis, Fernandez, Tallo and Pang who were near Majid at that time. Pepoy Embuscado then went out of the gate followed by Daniel Mercado, Reynaldo Caitor and Victor Embuscado. Santosidad was the last to follow as he was ordered by Daniel Mercado to follow them he being the guard. They proceeded to where Bashier Majid was seated on the pushcart. Mercado and Caitor pulled Majid from where he was seated while Pepoy Embuscado looked around the pushcart as if looking for something. Finding nothing, Pepoy Embuscado joined Mercado and Caitor in pulling Majid and bodily pushing him towards Gate No. 4. Upon seeing this, Baybayanon shouted saying: ""Tabang!"" meaning ""Help!"", but nobody helped except Marion Guangko who tried to hug Majid but he was elbowed by Pepoy Embuscado who then pulled out from his waist a revolver saying ""You have nothing to do with this!"". They continued to drag and push Majid towards Gate No. 4 and as they were nearing the gate, accused Federico Alazas went out of the gate and helped pull Majid towards the gate. As the accused and Majid passed the gate, Mercado ordered Santosidad to close the gate. Nevertheless, Fernandez remained at the gate and through the slit between the two shutters of the gate, he saw Majid being mauled and boxed by Caitor, Mercado, Alazas and Victor Embuscado, while Pepoy used the butt of his revolver in hitting the head of Majid and thereafter Pepoy Embuscado shot Majid with his revolver three times, two of which found their mark on the face and on the chest of Majid which were both fatal thus causing his death. Fernandez saw the shooting of Majid by Pepoy Embuscado but Guangko and Baybayanon did not, although the latter two heard three bursts of a gun in the immediate vicinity of Gate No. 4. While the four accused ran away from the scene of the shooting towards the Medicine Building, accused Alazas was seen taking a piece of plywood and placing it near the body of Majid in such a way that it sheltered the, body of Majid from the heat of the sun. ""Cashier Majid was brought to the Sacred Heart Hospital by the students who tried to help him but nothing could be done anymore. Bashier Majid was dead. ... "" 






On March 10, 1983, the body of the deceased Bashier Majid was examined by Dr. Tomas P. Refe, the Senior Medico Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation at Cebu City. The necropsy report submitted by Dr. Refe contained the following findings:

The accused-appellants on the other hand claim that there was no conspiracy between them and the Embuscado brothers in the killing of Bashier Majid and pointed to the latter as the only persons responsible for the death of Bashier. The defense evidence is summarized in the decision of the lower court as follows: 






xxx			xxx			xxx 


... We gather from the testimony of Fermin Rendon, Daniel Mercado and Reynaldo Caitor that at about 10:00 o'clock in the morning of March 10, 1983, Fermin Rendon, a student of SWU. was copying notes of his classmate at the ground floor of the Engineering Building about seven to eight meters from Gate No. 4. Caitor and Mercado were in the vicinity of Gate No. 4 as well as the security guard and two other persons. Caitor was there because he had instructions from his immediate boss, Mr. Roberto Inoferio, to watch for developments in the campus on the third day of student demonstration because earlier that morning, a student named Billamil Hasan was found to have a pen-gun in his possession. Upon the other hand, Daniel Mercado was there because he was instructed to look-see for any happening, apprehensive as they were, because that was the third day of the student demonstration in the SWU. campus. While Caitor and Mercado were thus conversing, they allegedly heard a voice saying, ""If you don't allow me to check your bag, you will not be allowed to enter!"" The voice was that of the security guard on duty, accused Francisco Santosidad, and the person to whom these words were addressed to, was Bashier Majid. Majid was about to enter the gate allegedly bringing a bag slung on his shoulder. Santosidad wanted to inspect the bag but Majid allegedly refused and insisted in getting inside the gate so the guard grabbed the bag and in the process, he was outbalanced and he fell to the ground holding Majid's bag. Caitor and Mercado then held Majid telling him to go with them to the office. All so, suddenly, Pepoy Embuscado came from behind Majid obviously very mad, and telling Caitor and Mercado to get out of his way, as he was holding a revolver with his two hands outstretched, pointing it to Majid. Caitor said, ""Poy don't, Poy! What is this?, while Mercado said, ""Poy, Poy, don't, Poy!"" but Pepoy Embuscado persisted saying, ""You have nothing to do with this. Get away from here!"" So Caitor and Mercado let loose Majid and they moved backward and immediately Pepoy Embuscado fired three shots from his gun hitting Bashier Majid. Caitor laid prone on the ground while Mercado ran towards the Medicine Building. As Caitor looked up, he saw Pepoy Embuscado and Victor Embuscado running away from the scene of the shooting. Caitor stood up and ran away towards the lobby and up to the Engineering Building. After a little while, Caitor went back to the scene of the shooting as many students were already surrounding Bashier Majid who at this time was lying prostrate on the ground. Mercado also went back to the scene of the shooting. Then, Patrolman Rafael Apurado arrived followed by Federico Alazas. The policeman inquired who shot Majid and somebody in the crown said, ""They already ran away."" Apurado requested Caitor and Mercado to get an ambulance so they went to the Sacred Heart Hospital nearby but the driver of the ambulance was not around. They went back and saw that Majid was already bodily carried by the students, then later loaded on a Volkswagen and brought to the hospital. Bashier Majid was already dead on arrival at the hospital.

On December 17, 1983, the lower court found the existence of conspiracy between Reynaldo Caitor, Daniel Mercado, Pepoy Embuscado and Victor Embuscado and convicted the accused- appellants of the crime of murder. Federico Alazas and Francisco Santosidad were acquitted on grounds of reasonable doubt. The dispositive portion of the decision reads: 






WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Reynaldo Caitor and Daniel Mercado, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder as defined and penalized under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code. There being no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance, the penalty shall be in the medium period. Consequently, Reynaldo Caitor and Daniel Mercado are each sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of Bashier Majid in the sum of P12,000,00, and each to pay 1/6 of the costs of this action. 


With respect to the accused Federico Alazas and Francisco Santosidad they are hereby acquitted on the ground that their guilt was not established beyond reasonable doubt. The Cebu METRODISCOM or the City Warden, or whoever is in custody of the accused Federico Alazas and Francisco Santosidad, is hereby ordered to release them immediately from further custody unless they are being detained for some other crimes. 


Let the record of this case be placed in the archive subject to be recalled to the regular calendar of the Court anytime that accused Victor Embuscado and Pepoy Embuscado or either one of them shall have been arrested and brought to the jurisdiction of this Court. 






Accused-appellants Reynaldo Caitor and Daniel Mercado now raise the following assignments of errors in this appeal: 






ERROR NO. I 


THE HONORABLE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT CONSPIRACY EXISTS BETWEEN THE APPELLANTS MERCADO AND CAITOR WITH THE ACCUSED EMBUSCADO BROTHERS. 


ERROR NO. II 


THE HONORABLE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE APPELLANTS GUILTY IN THE KILLING OF CASHIER MAJID. 






The appellants argue that there was no conspiracy between them and Pepoy Embuscado when the latter shot Bashier Majid. According to them, the testimonies of Benjamin Fernandez, Marlon Guangko and Felicidad Baybayanon that all the accused took turns in kicking, boxing, and mauling Bashier Majid are belied by the findings of Dr. Tomas Refe in his Necropsy Report. 


The appellants' contentions have no merit. The existence of conspiracy was proven by the number of indefinite acts of the appellants which were all aimed towards the accomplishment of a common unlawful purpose. Benjamin Fernandez testified that:

(tsn., October 6, 1983, p. 68) 














We agree with the observation of the Solicitor General that the accused-appellants and the Embuscado brothers, as members of the Southwestern University security force must have been impelled by the common desire to go after the leaders of the student demonstration and Bashier Majid was one. In fact, before the shooting incident, the leaders of the student demonstrations were under very close surveillance by the four (4) accused. 


The foregoing background of the crime coupled with the unimpeached testimonies of the three prosecution witnesses and corroborated by the testimony of one of the accused, indisputably show that the accused-appellants acted in concert with their co-accused Pepoy Embuscado and Victor Embuscado in killing Bashier Majid. The presence of conspiracy is evident since the appellants took part in the deed and cooperated with one another showing a unity of purpose and criminal intent. In 
People v. Plandez
, (132 SCRA 69), we held that:

... conspiracy can be inferred and proven by the acts of the accused themselves when said acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interests, and such unity of purpose and concert of action serve to establish the existence of the conspiracy and the criminal liability as principals of the conspirators. ... 






Against these straightforward testimonies of the three (3) prosecution witnesses, the accused-appellants could only present a defense of denial and even concocted a story about a blue bag containing a ""barong"" and a ""moslem bolo"" being in the possession of Bashier Majid as he was about to enter the premises of the university. 


Santosidad, the accused security guard who was assigned at Gate No. 4 and who allegedly grabbed the blue bag, denied having seen that bag in the possession of Bashier Majid nor having grabbed it from him. On the contrary, Santosidad categorically testified that he was instructed by Mr. Inoferio, the head of the Office of Students Affairs to ten to the media people that Bashier was carrying a blue bag containing a ""barong"" and a ""moslem bolo"" as he was about to enter the university premises and that he grabbed this bag. He testified that: 










Atty. Parades: 


	And you were given instructions inside the office of Robert Inoferio, is that correct? 


A	Yes. 


Q	And you testified also that you were taught by 'them', whom are you referring to when you used the word 'them'? 


A	Mr. Inoferio and a companion of his inside the office but since it was Mr. Inoferio who gave me the instructions I was only looking at him.""

Q	One of the things he taught you was this . . . please correct me if I am wrong . . . Mr. Inoferio said: ""I have here a blue bag and there is a television crew that will arrive and you will tell them that this bag containing the ""barong was brought by Bashier Majid. That was the instruction, was it? 


A	That is right. That was his instruction to me, Sir. 


Q	And you followed this instruction because you were afraid that you might be harmed by them? 


A	Yes, because there in the office I cannot do anything.""

Atty. Parades: 


	So you were forced to declare publicly that you confiscated a blue bag and a barong"" from Bashier Majid even if it were not true? 


A	Even if it were not true but I was forced to declare that before the media people. 






(tsn., October 6, 1983, pp. 86-87)






COURT: 


	Why did you consider the testimony of Caitor that you grabbed that bag from Bashier Majid as if you were being implicated by them?


A	Because that was what he testified here that I was the guard who got that blue bag from Bashier Majid and that later I fell to the ground. 


COURT: 


	Because that was the truth then regarding this blue bag? 


A	The truth Your Honor is that I never got hold of that blue bag. 


COURT: 


	And was there any grappling for the possession of this bag between you and Bashier Majid immediately before he was shot?


A	No, I did not get a blue bag from him, Your Honor. 






(tsn., October 6, 1983, pp. 99-100) 














The dubious introduction of the blue bag as evidence and the testimony of Santosidad, greatly affected the credibility of the accused-appellants and considerably weakened the defense evidence. 


The accused-appellants further argue that the following incidents which happened immediately after the shooting negates the existence of conspiracy between them and the Embuscado brothers: (1) the Embuscado brothers took flight; (2) the accused-appellants remained at the vicinity of Gate No. 4 of the Southwestern University and assisted Pat. Rafael Apurado; (3) when Daniel Mercado, Reynaldo Caitor, Federico Alazas and Atty. Jose Aznar went to the office of Philippine Constabulary General Olano on March 13, 1983, the accused-appellants were not aware that they were implicated in the shooting of Bashier Majid; (4) it was only after the informal investigation conducted by General Olano and after they were asked to proceed to Police Captain Romeo Colina that they were informed of their being implicated in the shooting incident; (5) they asked for the deferment of the trial after the arrest of the Embuscado brothers as they believed that the Embuscado brothers would readily admit that the shooting of Bashier Majid was of their own making and not of the rest of the accused; and (6) in their desire to have the Embuscado brothers arrested, the accused-appellants even secured a picture of Pepoy Embuscado, had it enlarged, copied and gave the copies to PC Major Degamo, Captain Castor and other PC officers. 


The introduction of the blue bag as evidence clearly shows the accused-appellants' intention, in concert with Mr. Inoferio of the Office of the Students Affairs, to conceal the commission of the crime. 


The act of the accused-appellants in not leaving the place of shooting and even helping Sgt. Apurado while the Embuscado brothers took flight, the fact that they pretended not to be aware that they were implicated in the shooting, and that while in jail even secured a picture of Pepoy Embuscado to help the police arrest him do not exculpate them from the proved criminal liability and, in fact as intimated by the Solicitor General, these acts form part of their plan to escape criminal responsibility. 


WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED with the modification that the indemnity is increased to THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (P30,000.00), and one-half (½) of the costs shall be paid by each of the accused-appellants. 


SO ORDERED.
