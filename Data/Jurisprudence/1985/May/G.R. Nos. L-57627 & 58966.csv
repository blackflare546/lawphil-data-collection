G.R. Nos. L-57627 & 58966	May 31, 1985


ROLANDO TINIO, 
petitioner,

vs.


JUDGE JOSE P. CASTRO, Court of First Instance of Quezon City, and ANNA H. QUINTAL, 
respondents.


Antonio Quintos for petitioner. 


Benjamin M. Tan for respondent Anna H. Quintal. 


R E S O L U T I O N 


Â 


AQUINO, 
J.:


This is an ejectment case. Rolando Tinio, the tenant, in his petition dated August 6, 1981 prayed that the sheriff of Quezon City be enjoined from executing the judgment of the city court of Quezon City dated November 14, 1979 ejecting him (G. R. No. 57627).


In his petition dated November 25, 1981 Tinio prayed that said judgment be set aside (G. R. No. 58966).


Anna H. Quintal the landlady, owner of the premises at 79 C. Salvador Street, Loyola Heights, Quezon City, answered both petitions. The cases were submitted for decision. 


On May 17, 1985 the parties filed a joint motion praying that the two cases be dismissed for having become moot and academic because Tinio had vacated the premises and the possession thereof had already been delivered to Anna. 


WHEREFORE, these two cases are dismissed without costs. 


SO ORDERED. 


Makasiar (Chairman), Abad Santos, Escolin and Cuevas, JJ., concur. 


Concepcion Jr., J., took no part.
