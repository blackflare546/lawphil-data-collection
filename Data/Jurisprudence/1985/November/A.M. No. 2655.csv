3




Required to comment, within ten (10) days from notice, through our Resolution, dated August 8, 1984, 
4


 respondent failed to do so despite service together with a copy a of the letter-complaint at his residence at 13 President's Ave., Teoville Subdivision, Sucat Road, Parañaque, Metro Manila. 


For failure to file said Comment within the period which expired on September 9, 1984 we resolved to require him ""a) to SHOW CAUSE why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for such failure and b) to COMPLY with the resolution of August 8, 1984 requiring him to file said comment, both within 10 days from notice hereof.""

Copy of the aforesaid Resolution not having been served at respondent's other address at 117 Ramon Tirona St., BF Homes, Parañaque, M.M., with the process server's notation: ""no longer residing at such address, not known in the forwarding address"" we required complainant to ""INFORM this Court of the correct and present address of Atty. Patricio Asoy within five (5) days form notice hereof."" 
6
 Though the Philippine Consulate General in Sydney, Australia, complainant has manifested that he is unaware of respondent's present whereabouts.


In the meanwhile, other copies of our February 25, 1985 Resolution were served at respondent's known office addresses at the Central Bank, Legal Department, Manila, and at Suite 306, Filman Bank bldg., Plaza Sta. Cruz, Manila, which were both returned unserved.

Service was tried, next, at Asia International Builders Corp., 5th Floor, ADC Bldg., Ayala Avenue, Makati M.M., the address given in respondent's calling card, but the 1st Division Clerk of Court was informed that respondent had ceased working that office as of June 16, 1984.


Respondent's provincial address at the Bar Office of this Court was nest tried through the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Tacloban Chapter, with the request that this Court be informed of the whereabouts of respondent. In a telegram, dated October 10, 1985, the IBP has informed the Court that respondent is not a member of the Leyte Chapter.
