On the basis of the aforequoted stipulation of facts, the lower court rendered judgment on April 11, 1973, the dispositive portion of which reads: 




WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the Court hereby renders judgment directing defendants to respect, recognize and abide by the terms and conditions of the contracts of sale, Annexes B, B-1 to B-9; for plaintiffs to continue the payments of the installment due thereunder; for defendants to credit plaintiffs for all the installment payments heretofore made by them on their respective lots; and for defendants to pay plaintiffs the sum of P2,000.00 byway of attorney's fees. The rest of the prayer for damages is denied for lack of sufficient basis. 




On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed said judgment and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint. In reversing the lower court, the Court of Appeals held that the disclosure by the spouses Cruz to the Victorias of their intention to subdivide the property into residential lots was merely simple talk on preliminaries attendant to a contract of sale, and its non-compliance does not affect the rights and obligations embodied in their contract; that the statement made by Cruz spouses that they were the attorney in fact of Victorias was not at all binding upon Victoria, as it was expressly stated in paragraph 6 of the Stipulation of Facts that the Cruz spouses were never been appointed as such; that when the spouses Cruz and the Victorias formally executed a deed of sale with mortgage on March 1 1,1970, the contracts of sale in favor of the lot buyers were not mentioned in the said deed considering that the contracts of sale were made prior to the execution of the said deed, hence, the lot buyers could not compel the Victorias to recognize their contracts with the spouses Cruz; that there is no stipulation and evidence that the lot buyers upon the execution of the con-tracts in their favor took possession, openly and publicly of the property in question so as to give notice to the Victorias of their prior rights; that the separate titles issued on each lot were all in the name of Cruz with the mortgage in favor of the Victorias annotated, but no notation was made as to the interests of the lot buyers; that there is no evidence on record to show that the Victorias were in estoppel; that there is no stipulation that any of the money paid by the lot buyers to the spouses Cruz had been illegally appropriated by the Victorias and that the spouses Victoria were clearly mortgagees with real right to foreclose the same when their mortgage credit was not paid on time. 


Hence, the instant petition for review on certiorari, petitioner assigned to this Court for resolution five (5) errors, to wit: 




I


THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT FROM THE COMBINATION OF THE UNDISPUTED CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE, THE VICTORIAS KNEW OF THE SALE BY PEDRO M. CRUZ OF THE SUBDIVIDED LOTS TO THE PETITIONERS. 


II


THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE VICTORIAS MERELY STEPPED INTO THE SHOES OF THE CRUZ SPOUSES.


III


THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE EXTRAJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE OF THE MORTGAGE HERE INVOLVED IS A TOTAL NULLITY BECAUSE THE DEED OF MORTGAGE DID NOT CONTAIN A SPECIAL POWER OF ATTORNEY IN FAVOR OF THE MORTGAGEES TO SELL THE PROPERTY AT PUBLIC AUCTION. 


IV 


THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE VICTORIAS WERE NOT UNJUSTLY ENRICHED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PETITIONERS.


V 


THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT MOTU PROPRIO HOLDING THAT IT HAD NO JURISDICTION OVER THE PRESENT APPEAL AND IN NOT ELEVATING THE APPEAL TO THIS HONORABLE COURT FOR DETERMINATION. 


We find no merit in the present appeal. The property in question was originally owned by the Victories. On July 10,1969, they executed in favor of the spouses Pedro M. Cruz and Rosalina Villar a contract to sell said property, which at that time was still unregistered and was covered by Tax Declaration No. 5685, Under said agreement, it was stipulated that while possession of the property shag be considered delivered to the buyers Pedro M. Cruz and Rosalina Villar, the ownership thereof shall remain with the Victorias until the downpayment of P70,000.00 shag have been paid, in which event the necessary deed of transfer of ownership of the property will be executed together with a first mortgage on the property in favor of the Victorias to secure payment of the balance of the purchase price. On March 11, 1970, said deed of transfer with first mortgage on the property was executed between the Victorias and Pedro M. Cruz and Rosalina Villar. Thereafter the Cruzes registered the property and were issued Original Certificate of Title No. 8626 with the mortgage constituted on the property in favor of the Victorias annotated thereon. 




Because the Cruzes failed to pay the balance of the purchase price of the property the Victorias foreclosed extrajudicially the mortgage in their favor and at the auction sale they were the highest bidder. Before the expiration of the period of redemption with the consent of the Victorias the property was subdivided into several lots and individual titles were issued covering said lots in the name of Pedro M. Cruz. Each of new certificate of transfer for the lots to which the property was subdivided was issued in the name of Pedro M. Cruz with the mortgage and sheriffs certificate of sale in favor of the Victorias duly annotated thereon. 


When the property was sold at public auction in view of the default of the Cruzes to pay their mortgage indebtedness there was no annotation of any sale executed by the Cruzes in favor of the petitioners which would have placed on notice the bidders including the Victories at said public auction sale. Well settled is the rule that all persons dealing with property covered by torrens certificate of title are not required to go beyond what appears on the face of the title. When there is nothing on the certificate of title to indicate any cloud or vice in the ownership of the property, or any encumbrance thereon, the purchaser is not required to explore further than what the torrens title upon its face indicates in quest for any hidden defect or inchoate right that may subsequently defeat his right thereto. (

 vs. 
Garcia
, 64 Phil., 506; 
Fulle
 vs. 
Legare
, 7 SCRA 351).


As a matter of fact, there is no evidence nor any statement in the Stipulation of Facts to show that petitioners had actually taken possession of portions of the property in question sold to them which would have at least called the attention of the Victorias that the Cruzes had sold said portions to petitioners. The contracts of sale in favor of some petitioners executed in 1959 stated that Pedro M. Cruz was merely the attorney-in-fact of the owner of the property. (Annexes A-2, Contract of Sale in favor of Artemio Gutierrez; Annex A-3, Contract of Sale in favor of Gregorio Hernandez, A-4, Contract of Sale in favor of Zenaida de la Cruz; A-5, Contract of Sale in favor of Francisco Gomez: A-6. Contract of Sale in favor of Ricardo Adrao: A-7, Contract of Sale in favor of Amparo Rayos; A-8, Contract of Sale in favor of Ofelia Santos), At the time Pedro M. Cruz executed said deeds of sale, he was not yet the owner of the property. Said, buyers should have known that the owners of the property were the Victorias as the deeds of sale in their favor described the property as property described in Tax Declaration No. 8685 of the municipality of Taguig, Rizal. Had they investigated in whose name Tax Declaration No. 5685 was issued, they would have found out that it was in the name of the Victorias. 


After Pedro M. Cruz had obtained a certificate of title over the property in his name said title was subject to the mortgage in favor of the Victorias. Any sale executed by the Cruzes in favor of the petitioners would then be subject to the rights of the mortgages of said property. Even if the petitioners had registered the deed in their favor, which they did not, their rights under said deed of sale can not prevail over the rights of the mortgagee which have been annotated on said property from the beginning, that is to say when original certificate of title 8626 was issued in February 1971. 


Moreover, the petitioners can not bind the Victorias under the deeds of sale executed in their favor by Cruz allegedly as an attorney-in-fact of the Victorias because it is not true that Pedro M. Cruz was the attorney-in-fact of the Victorias. According to paragraph 6 of the Stipulation of Facts, Pedro M. Cruz had never been appointed as their attorney-in-fact by the Victorias. Neither can they compel the Victories to recognize the deeds of sale in their favor the ground of estoppel in allowing Pedro M. Cruz to sell the properties in question to petitioners. According to paragraph 18 of the Stipulation of Facts Victorias came to know of the sales made by Pedro M. Cruz in favor of petitioners only after property was sold to the them the foreclosure sale. 




18.	The defendants came to know from said Pedro M. Cruz himself of the ""Contract of Sale"" executed by the latter in favor of various persons, including the plaintiffs only after the Certificate of Sale executed by the Provincial Sheriff of Rizal (Annex 'F') was issued: 




Pan 2 of the Stipulation of Facts wherein it is stated that when the Victorias agreed to sell the property to the Cruzes in 1969 the latter informed the former that their intention was to subdivide the property for resale is cited by petitioners as proof that the Victorias had knowledge of the sales of the lots to which the property had been subdivided. That is not necessarily so. Moreover, even granting that the Cruzes had told the Victorias of their plan to subdivide the property they were buying, that did not impose any legal obligation upon the Victorias to be bound by any sales made by Cruz before they become the owner of the property. Neither did that imply that subdivision of the property and subsequent sale of the lots to which it be subdivided would in any way bar them from asserting their legal rights to sail property as the owners thereof before they are fully paid the purchase price or their rights under any mortgage executed in their favor to secure the balance of the payment of the purchase price of the property.


As the Victories were not parties to the contracts of sale in favor of petitioners, the same having been executed by Pedro M. Cruz and petitioners and according to the Stipulation of Facts Pedro M. Cruz had never been appointed attorney-in-fact of the Victories, there is no privity of contract between petitioners and the Victorias. Petitioners have no cause of action against the Victories since there is no evidence whatsoever to show that petitioners by acts or omissions of the Victorias had been induced to buy lots to which the property had been subdivided by the Cruzes. Neither is there any evidence that the Victorias had received any of the money paid by said petitioners to the Cruzes for the lots bought by them. Petitioners recourse must be against the Cruzes. 


In view of the foregoing, the present petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit and the decision of the Court of Appeals AFFIRMED with costs against petitioners. 


SO ORDERED.
