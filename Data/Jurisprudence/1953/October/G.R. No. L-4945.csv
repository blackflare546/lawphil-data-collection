MAASIN, Leyte, April 12, 1951


Upon the above quoted stipulations of facts, the Court of First Instance of Leyte rendered judgment, the dispositive part of which is —


(a)	Declarando a los recurrentes Teodulo Orais, Eulalio Bernades, Dominador Cordoves, Domingo Saligo, Teotimo Mullet, Ramon Cadavero, David Lim, Nicomedes Conejos, Vedasto Cabales, Meliton de Gracia, y Margarito Basuga, sin derecho a los cargos de sargento de la guardia provincial y guardias provinciales ocupados por los recurridos Isidro Magallanes, Pedro Flores, Francisco Tavera, Narciso Ravago, Crisanto Cab, Dalmacio Cortel, Rafael Galleon, Filomeno Adobas, Jacinto Barro, Tereso Caindoy y Arcadio Maglines, y sobreseyendo su accion.


(b)	Declarando a los recurrentes Felipe Enelo y Luis Marte con derecho de continuar en sus cargos como guardias provinciales y que los nombremientos extendidos a favor de los recurridos Bienvenido Gonzales y Constancio Acasioson contrarios a la ley, y ordenado a estos dos ultimos que entreguen suspuestos a los refiridos recurrente Felipe Enelo y Luis Marte.


(c)	Ordenado al tesorero provincial Sr. Melecio Palma, o a su succesor porque pague los sueldos de los reccurentes Felipe Enelo y Luis Marte desdeal primero de Noviembre de 1950 y mientras dichos reccurentes continuendes empenando sus cargos legalmente.


(d)	Sobreseyendo la accion de los recurrentes Manuel Kangleon y Alfredo Lucin.


(e)	Absolviendo libremente de la demanda a los recurridos Mamerto S. Riboy Francisco P. Lopez; y


(f)	Condenando a los recurrentes, excepcion de Felipe Enelo y Luis Marte, a pagar las costas del juicio.


From this judgment the petitioners, with the exception of Felipe Enelo and Luis Marte, appealed,. Respondents Bienvenido Gonzales and Constancio Acasio appealed from the decision in so far as the trial court found them not entitled to the positions claimed by them.


The respondents Isidro Magallanes, Pedro Flores, Francisco Tavera and Narciso Ravago, all civil service eligibles, replaced the petitioners Teodulo T. Orais, David Lim, Domingo Saligo and Eulalio Bernades, respectively, who are not civil service eligibles. The rest of the respondents, all not civil service eligibles, replaced the rest of the petitioners, except Manuel Kangleon and Alfredo Lucin, who are also not civil service eligibles. Respondents Bienvenido Gonzales and Constancio Acasio, not civil service eligibles are veterans.


Petitioners invoke in support of their claim section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by Commonwealth Acts Nos. 177 and 281. Said section provides:


Temporary appointment without examination and certification by the commissioner of civil service on his local representative shall not be made to a competitive position in any case, except when the public interest so require, and then only upon the prior authorization of the Commissioner of Civil Service; and any temporary appointment so authorized shall continue only for such period not exceeding three months as may be necessary to make appointment through certification of eligibles, and in no case shall extend beyond thirty days from receipt by the chief of the bureau of office of the Commissioner's certification of eligibles; . . .


Appointments made under the section are temporary, when the public interests so require and only upon the prior authorization of the commissioner of civil service, not to exceed three months and in no case shall extend beyond thirty days from receipt by the chief of the bureau or office of the commissioner's certification of eligibles. The fact that the petitioners held the positions for more then three months does not make them civil service eligibles. Also the fact that the acting commissioner of civil service authorized their appointments ""under section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code to continue only until replaced by an eligible"" does not make them eligibles. The holding of a position by a temporary appointee until replaced by an eligible in disregard of the time limitation of three months is authorized and illegal. The temporary appointment of other no-eligibles to replace those whose terms have expired is not prohibited. Hence the replacement of Teodulo T. Orais, David Lim, Domingo Saligo and Eulalio Bernardes, who are non-eligibles, by Isidro Magallanes, Pedro Flores, Francisco Tavera and Narciso Ravago, who are eligibles, is in accordance with law. The replacement of non-eligibles by non-eligibles is lawful under the pursuant to section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code. The replacement of Felipe Enelo and Luis Marte, non-eligibles but veterans, by Bienvenido Gonzales and Constancio Acasio, who are non-eligibles, is unlawful. The former are preferred under Republic Act No. 65, as amended by Republic Act No. 154, they having been appointed within the term provided for in said Republic Acts. If the preference of a veteran is to be confined to appointment and promotion only and does not include the right to continue to hold the position to which he was appointed until an eligible is certified by the Commissioner of Civil Service, then he would be in no better situation than anon-eligible who is not a veteran. The appointment of a veteran, however, is subject to cancellation or his removal from office or employment must be made by competent authority when the Commissioner of Civil Service certifies that there is an eligible.


There is no averment in the petition that the positions held by Manuel Kangleon and Alfredo Lucin were usurped or that they were replaced by others in their positions as provincial guards. Hence the petition in so far as it concerns them must be dismissed.


Republic Act No. 557 is also invoked by the appellants Bienvenido Gonzales and Constancio Acasio. The act guarantees the tenure of office of provincial guards and members of city and municipal police who are eligibles. Non-eligibles like the two appellants do not come under the protection of the act invoked by them.


The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without costs.
