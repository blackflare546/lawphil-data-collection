WILLARD, 
J.:


This is an original action brought in this court under the provisions of Act No. 1376. It is similar to the case of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church vs. The Municipalities of the Province of Tarlac (9 Phil. Rep., 450).


MUNICIPALITY OF LANGARAN


It is hereby adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff church is the owner and is entitled to the immediate possession of the following-described property situated in the municipality of Langaran in the Province of Misamis, to wit — 




A church, a convent, a cemetery, and a
 plaza 
known as the church, convent, cemetery, and
 plaza 
of Langaran, and the chapels known as 
visitas 
of Baliangao, Monella, and Biaton —




and that neither the said municipality, nor the defendant Gregorio Aglipay, as 
Obispo Maximo 
of the Independent Filipino Church, nor Jose de Luna has any right, title, or interest therein.

MUNICIPALITY OF CAGAYAN.


Among the properties described in the complaint as situated in the municipality of Cagayan is a tract of land in the barrio of Molugan. This tract of land contains cocoanut trees, and the evidence is that from that coconuts was obtained oil which was used in the church.


Our jurisdiction in this class of cases is limited to churches, convents, and cemeteries, and the real and personal property used in connection therewith. We do not think that the evidence in this case shows that this tract of land is used in connection with the church. It must, therefore, be eliminated from the complaint, as we have no jurisdiction to determine the questions between the parties relating thereto. (Roman Catholic Church 
vs.
 Municipalities of Oriental Negros, 9 Phil. Rep., 691; Roman Catholic Church 
vs.
 Municipalities of Iloilo, 10 Phil. Rep., 8.)

A church known as the church of Gusa —

 of the Independent Filipino Church, nor Bernardino Carboneros, nor Escolastico Carboneros has any right, title, or interest therein.
