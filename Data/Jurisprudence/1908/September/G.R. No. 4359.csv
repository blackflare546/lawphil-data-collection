TORRES, 
J.:


On the 19th of January, 1899, Emilio Antonio Escuin de los Santos executed a will before a notary public of Sevilla, Spain, stating therein that he was a native of Cavite, the son Francisco Escuin and Eugenia de los Santos, the latter being deceased; that he was married about six months previously to Maria Teresa Ponce de Leon, and that he had no lawful descendants; the testator, however, stated in clause three of his will, that in case he has a duly registered successor, his child would be his sole and universal heir; but that if, as would probably be the case, there should be no such heir, then in clause four he named his said father Francisco Escuin, and his wife Maria Teresa Ponce de Leon and his universal heirs, they to divide the estate in equal shares between them.


The testator died on the 20th of January, 1899, as certified to by the Municipal court of Magdalena, Sevilla, on the 20th of March, 1990.


Upon the will having been admitted to probate, commissioners were appointed to consider claims against the estate, and, according to a report presented to the Court of First Instance on the 20th of June, 1907, one claim was allowed amounting to 3,696.50 pesetas.


On the 10th and 12th of July 1907, the attorney for the widow, Ponce de Leon, and the attorneys who represented the guardian to the minor, Emilio Escuin y Batac, appealed to the Court of First Instance from the findings of the aforesaid commissioners.


Matters stood thus, and without there appearing any decision of the court as to appeals, the attorney for the administrator, by a writing dated the 3d of September, following, moved for the approval of the proposed partition of the estate provided for by the court; by the first additional request (
otrosi
) he asked that the remuneration for the services of the administrator of the estate be fixed, and that he be authorized to draw such amount from the funds of the estate; and by a second additional request he asked that the accounts made up on the 31st of August, previous, be approved.


It appears in the proposed partition of the 3d of September, 1906, that, according to the opinion of the administrator by whom it was signed in the result of the proceedings, the property left by the estator, in accordance with the accounts passed upon by the court, amounted to .......................................................... P8,268.02




From said sum the following must be deducted:

All legal expenses paid and approved




1,105.01








3,253.21
