WILLARD, 
J.:


The plaintiff, as administrator of the estate of Jose Carlos Chung Muy Co, brought this action in this Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, alleging in his complaint that after the death of the said Jose Carlos, and on the same day, the defendants embezzled and appropriated to their own use P53,140 which belonged to the estate, and he asked that, in accordance with the provision of section 711 of the Code of Civil Procedure, judgment be entered against them for double that amount, or P106,280. The defendants denied all the allegations in the complaint.


The court below acquitted the defendants Ventura Chui-Tian Lay and Lim Ki of the complaint, and ordered judgment against the defendant Chun Gun Pan for P2,174.16, double the amount of P1,087.08 which the court said belonged to the estate and which this defendant had converted to his own use and for which he had failed to account to the estate. The plaintiff and Chun Gun Pan have appealed.


So far as the appeal of the plaintiff is concerned, the question presented is purely one of fact. Three witnesses for the plaintiff testified that about four days before the death of Jose Carlos, his son, Chung Kiat, at their request of the deceased, opened the safe in the room where they were and took therefrom a sum of money which he, Chung Kiat, counted and which amounted to P53,000, and that he then replaced the money in the safe. Jose Carlos died about 4 o'clock in the morning of October 19, 1905. Two witnesses testified that the defendants came there during that forenoon, opened the safe, took this amount of money therefrom, wrapped up the bills, amounting to P50,000 in a handkerchief, and carried away. These two witnesses and four other testified that as the defendant Chun Gun Pan, who had the bills wrapped in a handkerchief, got into the vehicle which was waiting for them in the street, the handkerchief struck against a post of the 
carromata
 and the bills fell into the ground.


Six witnesses, including in this number two of the defendants, testified that the three defendants were present in the house of Jose Carlos in the forenoon of October 19; that the defendants Chun Gun Pan and Chui-Tian Lay were relatives of the deceased, and that the persons there assembled had a conference in which it was decided that the safe be opened for the purpose of seeing what money there was in with which to defray the funeral expenses. Thereupon Chun Gun Pan opened the safe, its content were taken out, and in inventory then made by Keh Yong Keng in a small book, which inventory was signed by these persons and which was produced and identified in court. According to this inventory, the contents of the safe were the following:
