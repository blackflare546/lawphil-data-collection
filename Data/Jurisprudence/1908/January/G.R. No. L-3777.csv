						MANUEL ARAULLO,


Court of First Instance, Manila
.


After hearing the evidence adduced at the trial of the three causes, the court found that the evidence adduced during the trial of cause No. 2436 showed beyond peradventure of doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged in said complaint, in the manner and form as charged therein, and, extending to the defendant the benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code, sentenced her to be imprisoned for a period of three months, to return the jewelry mentioned in said complaint, or in default thereof to return the value, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for a period of one month, and to pay the costs. 


After hearing the evidence adduced in the cause 2437, the court found that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged in said complaint, in the manner and form charged therein, and, extending to the defendant the benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code, sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of three months, to return to Paulina Gomez the jewelry in question or the value thereof, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for a period of one month, and to pay the costs. 


After hearing the evidence at the trial of cause 2438, the court found the defendant guilty of the crime charged in said complaint, in the manner and form charged therein, and, extending to the defendant the benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code, sentenced her to be imprisoned for a period of three months, to return the jewelry in question, or the value thereof, to the person entitled thereto, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for the period of one month, and to pay the costs. 


From each of these sentences the defendant appealed to this court. 


An examination of the evidence produced at the trial of cause No. 2436 shows beyond possibility of doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged in said complaint. The value of jewelry appropriated in the manner and form stated in said complaint was the sum of P950; therefore the punishment provided for the offense is found in paragraph 5 of article 535, in its relation with paragraph 2 of article 534 of the Penal Code. The penalty under these provisions of the code is that of 
arresto mayor 
in its medium grade to
 presidio correcional 
in its minimum grade. 


The lower court gave the defendant the benefit of the mitigating circumstances of article 11 of the Penal Coade. This court has repeatedly decided that, in offenses against property, article 11 should not be applied in fixing the penalty as to mitigating circumstances. There being neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the crime, the defendant, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 81 of the Penal Code, must be punished in the medium degree of the penalty provided by law. The penalty applicable to the offense in the present case is that of four months and one day to six months of 
arresto mayor
. It is the judgment of this court, therefore, that the sentence of the lower court be modified and that the said defendant be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of four months and one day of 
arresto mayor
, with the accessory penalties provided for in article 61 of the Penal Code, to return the jewelry mentioned in said complaint or to indemnify the said offended party, Juana de Guzman, in the sum of P950, and, in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, which shall not exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and to pay the costs. 


An examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of cause No. 2437 convinces us that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged in said complaint, in the manner and form therein charged, and for the reasons given above for the modification of the sentence in said cause No. 2436, the sentence of the lower court in this cause (No. 2437) is hereby modified and the defendant is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of four months and one day of 
arresto mayor
, with the accessory penalties provided in article 61 of the Penal Code, to return the jewelry mentioned in said complaint and to indemnify the offended party, Paulina Gomez, in the sum of P450, and, in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, which shall not exceed one-third part of the principal penalty, and to pay the costs. 


An examination of the evidence produced at the trial of cause No. 2438 convinces us beyond peradventure of doubt that the defendant was guilty of crime charged in the complaint. For the reasons given above, in cause No. 2436, the sentence of the lower court in this cause (No. 2438) is hereby modified and the defendant is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of four months and one day of 
arresto mayor
, with the accessory penalties provided in article 61 of the Penal Code, to return the jewelry mentioned in said complaint or to indemnify the offended party, Aniceta del Rosario, in the sum of P250, and, in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, which shall not exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and to pay the costs. So ordered.
