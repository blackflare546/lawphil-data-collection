HON. WALFRIDO DE LOS ANGELES, Judge CFI-Rizal, Branch IV, Quezon City, LEONARDO GERONIMO, MARIA LAZARO MARIANO, GLICERIA LAZARO MARIANO, THE HEIRS OF PERPETUO LAZARO MARIANO, THE PHILIPPINE TRUST COMPANY and THE COURT OF APPEALS,
 respondents.


DIZON, 
J.:


  On August 8, 1968 petitioner Felipe de Guzman filed a petition to review the resolutions of the Court of Appeals dated March 19 and June 25, both of the year 1968. The first set aside the decision of said court of September 6, 1967, and the second affirmed the reversal of said decision and denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.


  The respondents named in the petition for review, aside from the Court of Appeals, are the Honorable Walfrido de los Angeles, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch IV, Q.C., the Philippine Trust Company, Leonardo Geronimo, Maria Lazaro Mariano, Gliceria Lazaro Mariano and the heirs of Perpetuo Lazaro Mariano.


  It appears from the petition that in Special Proceedings No. Q-573 ""Intestate Estate of the Deceased Antonio Geronimo"" of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, several parties appeared claiming to be the nearest kin of said decedent. Among them were respondent Leonardo Geronimo and the respondents Mariano. The first claimed to be a half-brother and the latter, relatives within the fifth degree of said decedent. Petitioner herein likewise appeared and asked for leave to intervene as claimant-creditor of the estate in view of alleged cash advances secured from him to be utilized solely for the purpose of prosecuting the case against the forger of the will of the decedent, claiming further in this connection that the efforts exerted by him and the persons who claimed to be the heirs of the decedent resulted in the conviction of the forger, thus saving the estate from going into the latter's hands. As a result, the original testate proceedings before the Court of First Instance of Rizal were converted into intestate proceedings. On August 26, 1961 the probate court allowed petitioner to intervene in said proceedings ""it appearing that he has a legal interest in this case for the protection of his rights"".


  The petition also alleges that the Court of First Instance of Rizal issued orders on January 30, April 5, April 24 and July 5, 1966 which in effect disposed of the entire properties of the estate, without the required publication of notices to the creditors of the estate, without making any previous declaration of heirs, without satisfying the obligations of the estate before ordering the distribution of its assets, and other alleged irregularities. To top all these, said Court later denied petitioner's formal complaint for intervention in its order of August 24, 1965, from which order petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals where the case was docketed as C.A.-G.R. No. 37061-R.


  The petition alleges likewise that notwithstanding the appeal mentioned above, the lower court issued on November 24, 1965 an order directing execution of the basic orders complained of, as a result of which petitioner had to file special civil action in the same Court of Appeals (C.A.-G.R. No. 37306-R) to annul the orders of said Court in the aforesaid intestate proceedings dated January 30, April 5, April 24 and July 5, 1965 together with its subsequent orders for their implementation. The petition further alleges that on September 6, 1967 the Court of Appeals decided C.A.-G.R. No. 37306 as follows:




  WHEREFORE, the questioned orders of January 30, April 5, April 24, 1965, July 5, 1965, August 25, 1965, September 29, 1965, and all other subsequent orders issued for the implementation of the main orders mentioned, are hereby set aside for being null and void; ordering the Marianos who evidently appeared to be excluded heirs of the deceased Antonio Geronimo and therefore cannot be parties interested in the estate of the decedent, to deliver all the properties that were delivered to them by virtue of the questioned orders and to account for the proceeds and rentals thereof to the Philippine Trust Company which is hereby directed to take possession of the same and to render an inventory thereof; declaring said properties reverted to the estate of the decedent; and directing the respondent court to satisfy first the claim of herein petitioner against the estate of the decedent before any distribution of the estate of the decedent is made.




  However, on March 19, 1968 the Court of Appeals reversed its decision of September 6, 1967, which reversal was subsequently affirmed by another resolution of June 25, 1968. These resolutions of the respondent Court of Appeals are the ones which petitioner sought to have this Court review as stated at the outset.


  The petition for review was given due course in our resolution of August 13, 1968 and after service of the proper notices for the filing of briefs, petitioner filed his on November 4, 1968 and respondents filed theirs on February 22, 1969.

  On March 7, 1969 petitioner, through counsel, and with conformity of counsel for the Marianos filed a pleading entitled ""MOTION TO APPROVE AMICABLE SETTLEMENT, ENJOIN THE PARTIES TO COMPLY THEREWITH AND TO DISMISS"", to which was attached the amicable settlement mentioned therein, executed on March 6, 1969 by petitioner Felipe de Guzman, on the one hand, and by Gliceria Lazaro Mariano, the heirs of Perpetuo Lazaro Mariano, namely, Pedro Leonila, Carmelita all surnamed Mariano, Feliciana Manalo vda. de Mariano, the heirs of Perpetuo Mariano, Jr., the heirs of Maria Lazaro Mariano, namely, Irma M., Zenaida M., Erlinda M. and Yolanda M., all surnamed Gulinao, respondents in G.R.
