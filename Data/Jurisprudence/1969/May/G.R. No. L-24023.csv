SANCHEZ, 
J.:


Upon petition filed on September 18, 1961, Pessumal Bhrojraj, born on January 15, 1897, in Hyderabad, Sind, India, and who immigrated into the Philippines about the year 1917, sought Philippine citizenship. The State opposed. The Court of First Instance of Surigao del Norte, in its decision rendered on July 7, 1963,
 1 
declared him eligible to be admitted as a Filipino citizen and granted his petition. The State appealed.


Reasons there are why the judgment should go for the State.


1. A condition usually required before a petition for naturalization may be considered is that petitioner should file with the Bureau of Justice a declaration of 
bona fide 
intention to become a citizen of the Philippines one year prior to the institution of the proceedings.
 2 
One statutory exception set forth in Section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law, as amended by Commonwealth Act 535, is accorded ""those who have resided continuously in the Philippines for a period of thirty years or more before filing their application.""

Paragraph 7 of the petition avers that petitioner continuously resided in the Philippines for 44 years at least immediately preceding the filing of said petition: since 1917, 32 years in the island of Corregidor and Manila, and 12 years in Surigao, Surigao del Norte since the year 1949. The truth of this averment, however, was challenged by the State. By his own testimony, petitioner brought forth the fact that since his arrival in the Philippines, he has visited his native India four times, in 1919, 1923, 1938 and 1948, each lasting from five to seven months. By the standard in 
Sy See vs. Republic
, 5 SCRA 189, 192, petitioner ""cannot be considered as having resided in the Philippines continuously as required by Section 5 of the Naturalization Act."" These absences impose on petitioner the burden of proving that they are compatible with continuous residence. Remiss in this, his case must fail. He has not discharged this burden. The filing of a declaration of intention is mandatory.
 3 
Without the required declaration of intention, the court 
a quo 
did not acquire jurisdiction to entertain his petition.
 4 
Such failure to file the declaration of intention ""rendered the entire proceeding null and void.""

2. Back to the law. Amongst the qualifications for naturalization is that the applicant ""must have some known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.""
 6 
Neither the averments of the petition nor the evidence adduced by petitioner complies with this indispensable requirement. Says paragraph 3 of the petition: ""My trade or profession is merchant in which I have been engaged since 1917 and from which I derive an average annual income of SIX THOUSAND (P6,000) pesos."" This alone would suffice to disqualify petitioner.


But let us go to the evidence. His income tax return for 1960 shows an annual net income of P2,097.43.
 7 
With four children, three of them studying and a wife to support, this income does not meet the requirement of lucrative income.
 8 


Nor will his testimony that his two elder sons by his first wife are giving him monthly pension totalling P400 be of help. This pension cannot be added to his income to make it lucrative. For, such pensions are not to be included in determining petitioner's financial capability for citizenship purposes. Like bonuses, commissions and allowances, said pensions are contingent, speculative and precarious.
 9 
The record shows that his two sons are still single. What if they marry and raise families of their own? What if their earnings take a dip, or become just sufficient for their own support? Imponderables there still are which could mean loss of their income. The net result is that the amount given him may be reduced; it may vary from time to time; it may even be totally cut out. Some such uncertain source indeed cannot be considered in assessing the amount of his lucrative income. But even if these P400 were to be included, nonetheless, the total will not measure up to the required lucrative income. It is well to recall at this point that the income for purposes of naturalization must be gauged as of the time of the filing of his application for naturalization. 
10 
Accordingly, adding the amount of P4,800.00 per year given to him by his said sons to his income of P2,097.43, his total income would only be P6,897.43. With a wife and four children to support as aforesaid and the low purchasing power of the peso coupled with the increased cost of living, again we say that his income is short of being lucrative. 
11 


FOR THE REASONS GIVEN, the judgment under review is hereby reversed, and the petition for naturalization of Pessumal Bhrojraj is hereby dismissed.


Costs against petitioner. So ordered.
