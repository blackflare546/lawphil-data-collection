TEEHANKEE, 
J.:


These cases are separate appeals filed by respective petitioners from respondent Court's Orders of November 8, 1963 and March 9, 1964 approving by a split 3 to 1 vote the settlement for P100,000.00 of the estimated P423,756.74 — judgment liability of respondent firm in favor of the claimants-members of the Santiago labor Union, executed on November 8, 1963 between respondent firm and the labor union as represented by a majority of its board of directors. The appeals are jointly resolved in this decision.


Petitioners in Cases L-23331-32 are the retained lawyers of the Santiago Labor Union who question respondent Court's approval of respondent firm's settlement of the union members' judgment claims with the union board of directors, without their knowledge and consent, notwithstanding their duly recorded attorneys' lien, and over the objection of a board member that the union board had no authority to compromise or quit-claim the judgment rights of the union members.
1


Petitioners in Cases L-23361-62 are forty-nine (49) claimants-members of the Santiago Labor Union who assail respondent Court's approval of the questioned settlement, without their authority as the real parties in interest, and who denounce the settlement as unconscionable and having been entered into by the majority of the union board ""under circumstances of fraud, deceit, mispresentation and/or concealment, especially where a member of the Court has actively used his official and personal influence to effect the settlement which is manifestly unjust to laborers who by reason of their financial disadvantages in a conflict with their employers need all the aid of the Court for their protection, consonant with law, justice and equity.""

The factual background goes as far back as June 21, 1952, when the Santiago Labor Union, composed of workers of the Santiago Rice Mill, a business enterprise engaged in the buying and milling of palay at Santiago, Isabela, and owned operated by King Hong Co., filed before the respondent Court of Industrial Relations Cases Nos. 709-V and V-1 hereof, a petition for overtime pay, premium pay for night, Sunday and holiday work, and for reinstatement of workers illegally laid off. As of then, the total sum claimed by the workers, as itemized in their amended petition of September 2, 1952 — P100,816.36 for overtime pay, P19,350.00 for premium pay and P3,360.00 for differential pay under the Minimum Wage Law — amounted to P123,526.36.

As recorded in this Court's decision of August 31, 1962 in 
Santiago Rice Mill, et al. vs. Santiago Labor Union
,
4
 which affirmed the Court of Industrial Relations judgment in favor of the workers, ""on September 19, 1958, after a protracted hearing during which scores of witnesses and voluminous exhibits were presented, the court, thru Judge Emiliano G. Tabigne, rendered decision dismissing the petition of the union for lack of merit and want of jurisdiction; but, upon a motion for reconsideration, the Court of Industrial 
en banc
, by a split decision of 3-2 vote, issued a resolution reversing the decision of the trial judge. The dispositive part of said resolution reads:


""WHEREFORE, the respondents are hereby ordered to pay the overtime claim of both male and female claimants herein computed at their basic pay for each period in question; the legal premium for night, Sunday and holiday work or services rendered by the male claimants herein computed also on the proven basic wage or salary at the time in question; to pay the overtime claim of their drivers computed on their respective monthly salaries; to pay the differentials due each of the women claimants on their wages from August 4, 1951 at the rate of P2.00 daily and P3.000 daily from August 4, 1952; and to reinstate the claimants both male and female, who have testified and proved their having been illegally laid-off, with the right of respondents to deduct from the back wages due each claimant any amount earned during the period of the illegal dismissal.""


The worker's decade of travail was not yet to be at an end, however, despite this Court's affirmance of the judgment for the workers. After the remand of the records for enforcement by respondent Court, and the corresponding examination of books, said Court's Chief Examiner filed his Partial Report of December 14, 1962, wherein the judgment award in favor of the workers was determined and computed, as follows:






(a) For back wages from January 1, 1953 to April 30, 1962 of all the 35 employees and laborers (26 workers, 6 laborers and 3 drivers) who testified in court, per dispositive part of the judgment, ""before deducting the amounts earned during the period of  the back wages by each claimant and before deduction of amounts corresponding to the back  wages of claimants who died before April 30, 1962"" at P6,380.00 for each of the 32 workers and P28,000.00 for each of the 3 drivers




P288,160.00






(b) For overtime and premium pay from January 1, 1948 to December 31, 1952 of some 104 workers, in varying amounts.
5




125,216.74






(c) For minimum wage differentials of P2.00 daily from September 10, 1951 to December 31,  1951 of 60 women workers




10,380.00






TOTAL






P423,756.74"
