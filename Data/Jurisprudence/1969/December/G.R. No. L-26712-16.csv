TEEHANKEE, 
J.:


In this appeal from an order of the Social Security Commission, we uphold the Commission's Order dismissing the petition before it, on the ground that in the absence of an express provision in the Social Security Act
1
 vesting in the Commission the power to condone penalties, it has no legal authority to condone, waive or relinquish the penalty for late premium remittances mandatorily imposed under the Social Security Act.


The five petitioners originally filed on November 20, 1964 separate petitions with respondent Commission, contesting the social security coverage of American missionaries who perform religious missionary work in the Philippines under specific employment contracts with petitioners. After several hearings, however, petitioners commendably desisted from further contesting said coverage, manifesting that they had adopted a policy of cooperation with the Philippine authorities in its program of social amelioration, with which they are in complete accord. They instead filed their consolidated amended petition dated May 7, 1966, praying for condonation of assessed penalties against them for delayed social security premium remittances in the aggregate amount of P69,446.42 for the period from September, 1958 to September, 1963.


In support of their request for condonation, petitioners alleged that they had labored under the impression that as international organizations, they were not subject to coverage under the Philippine Social Security System, but upon advice by certain Social Security System officials, they paid to the System in October, 1963, the total amount of P81,341.80, representing their back premiums for the period from September, 1958 to September, 1963. They further claimed that the penalties assessed against them appear to be inequitable, citing several resolutions of respondent Commission which in the past allegedly permitted condonation of such penalties.


On May 25, 1966, respondent System filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground that ""the Social Security Commission has no power or authority to condone penalties for late premium remittance, to which petitioners filed their opposition of June 15, 1966, and in turn, respondent filed its reply thereto of June 22, 1966.


Respondent Commission set the Motion to Dismiss for hearing and oral argument on July 20, 1966. At the hearing, petitioners' counsel made no appearance but submitted their Memorandum in lieu of oral argument. Upon petition of the System's Counsel, the Commission gave the parties a further period of fifteen days to submit their Memorandum consolidating their arguments, after which the motion would be deemed submitted for decision. Petitioners stood on their original memorandum, and respondent System filed its memorandum on August 4, 1966.


On September 22, 1966, respondent Commission issued its Order dismissing the petition, as follows:


Considering all of the foregoing, this Commission finds, and so holds, that in the absence of an express provision in the Social Security Act vesting in the Commission the power to condone penalties, it cannot legally do so. The policy enunciated in Commission Resolution No. 536, series of 1964, cited by the parties, in their respective pleadings, has been reiterated in Commission Resolution No. 878, dated August 18, 1966, wherein the Commission adopting the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Matters and Legislation of the Social Security Commission ruled that it ""has no power to condone, waive or relinquish the penalties for late premium remittances which may be imposed under the Social Security Act.""


WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby dismissed and petitioners are directed to pay the respondent System, within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Order, the amount of P69,446.42 representing the penalties payable by them, broken down as follows:
