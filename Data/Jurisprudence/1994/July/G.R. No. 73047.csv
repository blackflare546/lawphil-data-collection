R E S O L U T I O N






VITUG, 
J.:


This case stems from a complaint, docketed Civil Case No. 7393-M, for ""Confirmation of Ownership (and) Recovery of Possession with Damages,"" filed on 30 March 1984 by private respondents against petitioners' predecessor, the late Gabriel Capili, with the Regional Trial Court, Branch XVI — Malolos, Bulacan.


Private respondents alleged that they were co-owners and co-possessors of a parcel of land, with an area of 327 square meters, situated at Sta. Cruz, Paombong, Bulacan; that the property had, since 1961, been occupied by Gabriel Capili merely through the tolerance of private respondents; that when private respondents demanded that Capili vacate the premises, the latter refused and instead filed a Miscellaneous Sales Application over the lot, but that the application was denied by the Bureau of Lands; and that on appeal to the then Ministry of Natural Resources, the latter, on 29 October 1982, affirmed the decision of the Bureau of Lands.


Capili was declared in default in Civil Case No. 7393-M, and private respondents were allowed to present their evidence 
ex parte
. On 30 July 1984, the trial court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which read:






WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant:


1)	declaring and/or confirming plaintiffs' ownership over the parcel of land identified as Lot No. 2019, Cad-297;


2)	ordering the defendant as well as all persons acting for and in his behalf to vacate the premises and to surrender the possession of the subject property to the plaintiffs;


3)	ordering the defendant to pay actual damages to the plaintiffs in the amount of P5,000.00;


4)	ordering the defendant to pay attorney's fees in the amount of P5,000.00; and


5)	ordering the defendant to pay the costs of suit.


SO ORDERED.

Capili filed, on 04 October 1984, a petition for relief from judgment which the trial court denied in its order, dated 06 December 1984, for lack of merit. An appeal was interposed with the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals). On 18 October 1985, the appellate court rendered a decision denying the petition, dismissing the case and lifting the restraining order it previously issued. A motion for reconsideration was denied in the appellate court's resolution of 22 November 1985.


Thereafter, this petition for review on 
certiorari
 was filed with this Court raising the following issues:








WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT TRIAL JUDGE COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN DENYING THE PETITION FOR RELIEF OF JUDGMENT.


WHETHER OR NOT IN THE CASE AT BAR THE DENIAL OF THE PETITION FOR RELIEF CAN BE REVIEWED BY A WRIT OF 
CERTIORARI
.








A supplemental petition, dated 07 May 1986, was subsequently filed to state that the then Ministry of Natural Resources, in an order, dated 10 April 1986, modified its 29 October 1982 decision thusly:






IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision of this Office dated October 29, 1982 should be, as hereby it is, MODIFIED, in the sense that appellant-movant Gabriel Capili shall be given priority over the western-half portion of the lot in question where his house had been constructed, and the other half shall be given to appellees Luis and Pascuala Salamat. Accordingly, the Miscellaneous Sales Application No. (III-6) 112 of Gabriel Capili shall be given further due course for the western-half portion of the land and Luis and Pascuala Salamat shall be given the privilege to apply under a proper public land application the eastern-half portion, within sixty (60) days from finality of this Order.


SO ORDERED.

Private respondents submitted their comment to the petition on 12 October 1987. Meanwhile, the Court, on 22 October 1987, received a ""notice of death of (Capili) and substitution of (said) party by his heirs."" On 15 December 1987, petitioners submitted their reply to private respondents' comment. A rejoinder, dated 10 February 1988, was made to the comment. Thereafter, additional pleadings were filed by the parties.


Ultimately, this Court resolved to give due course to the petition and required the parties to submit their respective memoranda. The parties complied.


On 19 April 1994, the parties this time, represented by their attorneys-in-fact, submitted to this Court a compromise agreement, hereunder reproduced in full;
