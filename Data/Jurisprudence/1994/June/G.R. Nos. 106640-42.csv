afore-mentioned weapons, failing, however, to hit the latter thereby commencing the commission of the crime of murder directly by overt

acts but did not perform all the acts of execution which should have consumated [sic] it by reason of some clauses other than the spontaneous desistance of the accused, that is, the victim was able to ran away for escape.


CONTRARY TO LAW, particularly Article 248 in relation to Article 6 of the Revised Penal code of the Philippines.




On 26 June 1991, the RTC appointed Atty. Jose Miguel as 
counsel de oficio 
for the accused. On 8 July 1991, the accused, assisted by 
counsel de oficio
, were arraigned and they individually and separately entered a plea of not guilty to each of the crimes charged. On the same date, the prayer of both the prosecution and defense for a joint trial of the three (3) cases was granted by the trial court. On 10 October 1991, the joint trial commenced.


The prosecution presented the following witnesses:


Dominador Salinda, Jr., 
3


Antonio Ticmon, 
4


Jolito Helaos, 
5
 
Delia Tagayon, 
6
 
and Dr. Alfredo Calingin. 
7


The version of the prosecution as to the factual background of this case is as follows:


On 6 February 1991, at about five o’clock in the afternoon and while Beronio Tagayon, Dominador Salinda, Jr., and Jolito Helaos were preparing to go to their respective houses after cutting the grass on the land cultivated by Tagayon, accused Eugenio Resuma, Kupad Angias, and Romeo dela Cruz, all armed with shotguns, positioned themselves on an elevated portion of a hill about four (4) fathoms away from where Tagayon, Salinda, Jr., and Helaos were standing. As Salinda, Jr. and Helaos started to walk, they heard one gunshot coming from the hill. As they turned around towards the direction of the gunshot, they saw the tip of Resuma’s shotgun still smoking. Then they heard three (3) more gunshots. They saw Tagayon slumped on the ground. And as two (2) shotgun pellets grazed the outer garments of Helaos, he and Salinda, Jr. scampered in different directions to take cover.


Tagayon’s wife, Delia, who was about one hundred (100) meters away watching her husband approach their house, heard the first gunshot as well as the three (3) succeeding gunshots. She looked at the direction of the gunshots and saw the three (3) accused holding their weapons and withdrawing from their elevated position. Then she saw her fallen husband, and rushed to his aid Antonio Ticmon, who was one hundred fifty (150) meters away from where Tagayon fell, also heard the gunshots and saw the accused withdrawing. Then he approached the fallen Tagayon and helped Delia carry Tagayon’s wounded body to the latter’s house.


Shortly after Delia and Ticmon reached Tagayon’s house carrying the wounded Tagayon, the latter died. The next day, 7 February 1991, Dr. Alfredo Calingin, accompanied by a policeman, autopsied the body of Tagayon. He thereafter accomplished the autopsy report containing the details of the cause of death of Tagayon. The police authorities took the respective statements of Helaos, Salinda, Jr., Ticmon, and Delia Tagayon regarding the circumstances surrounding t he alleged attack on the victims.


The defense, in turn, presented the following witnesses: Romeo dela Cruz, 
8
 
Kupad Angias, 
9
 
Eugenio Resuma, 
10
 
Carlos Bautista, 
11
 
and Rolando Pillado. 
12


The defense adopted by the accused was basically denial of the crimes charged against them. To substantiate their defense, each of the accused attempted to negate the prosecution’s theory on the existence of conspiracy among the accused, and their direct participation in the crimes charged.


All the accused denied having any knowledge whatsoever of the alleged attack on Tagayon, Salinda, Jr., and Helaos. Accused dela Cruz averred that he did not have any misunderstanding with the victims. Accused Angias denied having known the victims and accused Resuma invoked alibi in support of his denial.


In addition, to counter the prosecution’s theory of conspiracy, dela Cruz claimed that he did not know his co-accused Angias, and that he only knew his co-accused Resuma as a buyer of the former’s (de la Cruz) corn. Accused Angias likewise denied knowing dela Cruz although he admitted to knowing Resuma but only as the husband of Angias’ niece. Finally, Resuma alleged that he could not have participated in the alleged crimes as he was scaling corn for Carlos Bautista in Camp Apeco in Barangay Ragandang at the time of the alleged attack on Tagayon.


In arriving at its judgment, the trial court found the evidence presented by the prosecution credible and sufficient to convict all the accused of the crimes charged beyond reasonable doubt. In finding that all the accused directly participated in the attack on the victims, the trial court stated:




Evidently, the prosecution relied heavily on the testimonies of the surviving offended victims, Dominador Salendab, Jr. [sic], and Jolito Helaos, who allegedly identified the accused, Eugenio Resuma, Kupad Angias, and Romero dela Cruz, as the persons who ambushed them on their way going home at about past 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon of February 6, 1991, and who fired gunshots at them which caused the death of their companion, Beronio Tagayon.


There is no dispute that Beronio Tagayon was with Dominador Salendab, Jr. [sic], and Jolito Helaos, when they were ambushed on their way and firedupon [sic], which caused the death of Beronio Tagayon of gunshot wounds. Undoubtedly, at 5:00 o’clock, more or less, in the afternoon of February 6, 1991, it was still bright when the incident in question took place. Carlos Bautista, who testified for the defense, had in fact declared in court that at 6:00 o’clock in the evening of February 6, 1991, it was still bright, and that at 6:30 o’clock in the evening of the same day, it was not yet very dark. Indubitably, there was no dispute as to

the identification of a person at about 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon of February 6, 1991. Evidently, it was still very bright at that time of the

day. . . .


. . . . Consequently, the Court feels that the defense of alibi of the accused in these cases deserves no credence, not only for being uncorroborated but also for being incredible, as it generates the impression that it is fabricated. . . .


Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing considerations, the Court is morally convinced that, through conspiracy, it was the three accused in theses [sic] cases who are responsible for the death of the deceased

victim, Beronio Tagayon, and of shooting at the offended private complainants, Dominador Salendab, Jr. [sic], and Jolito Helaos, in the afternoon (5:00 o’clock p.m.) of February 6, 1991, in Sitio Daligdig, Ragandang, Lebak, Sultan Kudarat. 
13




The trial court also discredited the defense posited by the accused. It observed, thus:




. . . . There is no doubt that the testimonies of the accused, Kupad Angias and Romero dela Cruz, in denying involvement in the commission of the crimes imputed against them, were uncorroborated. On the other hand, while the accused Eugenio Resuma presented Rolando Pillado, apparently, to corroborate his testimony, their testimonies, however, resulted to serious contradictions and inconsistencies as disclosed somewhere in the preceding paragraphs hereof. In effect, accused Eugenio Resuma had only shown falsehoods in his testimony. . . .


The testimony of Carlos Bautista is definitely unconvincing, and does not easily inspire confidence, belief and credence. How could you believe that for only fourteen (14) sacks of corn, it took him the whole day of February 6, 1991, until 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon to haul them to Camp Apeco, Ragandang, Lebak, from Erland, Ragandang, Lebak, covering a distance of only one (1) kilometer, and using a sledge pulled by a six-year old carabao? Can we believe that a sledge with a dimension of 3 ½ feet in length by 3 feet in width could only load two sacks of corn?


Admittedly, the defense put up by the accused in these cases is alibi, a defense which is said to be the weakest, seldom believed or given weight, as it is easy of fabrication, except when the identity of the accused has not been positively made, and when the evidence of alibi is airtight, which means that there was physical impossibility for the accused to be in the place where the incident took place because they were in another place which makes it physically impossible for them to be at the place of the incident. The Court is not , however, impressed by the alibi put up by the accused. It is far from being airtight. Considering, therefore the distance of the place, where the accused where at the time of the incident, which was not more than five (5) kilometers at most, it is not improbable that they could have been in the place of the incident, committed the acts imputed against them, then returned in the place where they claimed they were, by negotiating the distance in a short time.


xxx			xxx			xxx


Undoubtedly, the denial of the accused, Eugenio Resuma, Kupad Angias, and Romeo dela Cruz, in the commission of the crimes imputed against them, is unworthy of credence, and apart from being uncorroborated, it cannot stand above prosecution’s clear and satisfactory evidence. . . . 
14




Finally, in qualifying the acts of all the accused as constituting the crimes of Murder and Attempted Murder, respectively, the trial court made the following findings:




The Court is further convinced that conspiracy was satisfactorily established by positive and conclusive evidence as shown by the community of purpose on the part of the three accused as they were seen going together to the scene of the occurrence of the ambush with firearms and, later, seen firing with their guns at the deceased victim, Beronio Tagayon, and the two offended victims, Dominador Salendab, Jr. [sic], and Jolito Helaos.


With the nature of the evidence presented by the prosecution, were the qualifying aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation, as alleged in the Informations filed against the accused in these cases, duly established to qualify the crimes committed to Murder and Attempted Murders?


The Court honestly believes that on the basis of the method or way that the accused had committed the crimes, there was deliberate planning of the act before its execution. The evidence of the prosecution, no doubt, had established the existence of evident premeditation. Moreover, conspiracy generally presupposes premeditation.


Unquestionably, the victims in these cases were shot upon, causing the death of one, without them having put up any resistance and/or defense, as the attack on them was so sudden and unexpected. Indubitably, the accused had consciously adopted the form of attack employed by them, in a manner that would insure the execution of the crimes, without risk to themselves coming from the intended victims. Treachery, no doubt, was duly established by the evidence of the prosecution in these cases.


Accordingly, the prosecution has successfully established the guilt of the accused in each of the above-entitled cases beyond reasonable

doubt. 
15




In this appeal, accused-appellants raised a lone assignment of error, namely:




ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF THE CRIMES CHARGED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THEIR GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.




In support of their lone assignment of error, accused-appellants claim as uncontroverted three (3) submissions of the defense: First, the testimony of accused Resuma that he was scaling corn in Camp Apeco at the time of the ambush. Second, the testimony of prosecution witness Carlos Bautista corroborating the alibi of accused Resuma. And third, the testimony of Barangay Councilman Ramon Pillado regarding the alleged statements of complaining witnesses Salinda, Jr., and Helaos given to him (Pillado) to the effect that nobody witnessed the alleged ambush, and that nobody knew the identities of the perpetrators. As for the other accused Angias and dela Cruz, they insist on their innocence which they anchor upon their alleged lack of knowledge of the crimes.


We find the arguments of accused-appellants to be untenable.


Accused-appellants fault the trial court for relying on the direct and positive evidence of the prosecution consisting of the testimonies of four (4) eyewitnesses to the crimes. Prosecution witnesses Dominador Salinda, Jr., Jolito Helaos, Delia Tagayon, and Antonio Ticmon all testified that they saw the accused-appellants standing, each of them wielding shotguns with barrels still smoking from the earlier gunshots and aimed at the direction of where Tagayon, Salinda, Jr., and Helaos were standing. Furthermore, they testified as to the subsequent acts of the accused-appellants in retreating from their location after shooting at their victims.


In the face of this direct and positive evidence of the prosecution, the defense could only interpose denial and alibi. Yet, the accused-appellants would want this Court to rule that it was error for the trial court to disregard their substantially uncorroborated defense of denial and alibi.


We can not grant such improvident prayer of the accused-appellants, lest we set at naught overwhelming jurisprudence, a reiteration of which is found in the Court’s recent pronouncement in the case of 
People of the Philippines vs. Sulpicio Pajares
, 
16
 
wherein we held:




In sum, the lame defense of bare denial by accused-appellant cannot overcome the evidence presented by the prosecution proving him guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The solid testimony of Reynaldo de Vera who witnessed the entire incident; the testimony of police corporal Regalado that accused-appellant was positively identified by the victim Alberto Pilapil before his death; accused-appellant’s positive identification from among other inmates at the Police Headquarters by de Vera; and lastly, the damaging testimony of defense witness Hilario Candido who admitted that he saw a similar if not the same weapon in the possession of the accused the day before the criminal incident occurred are enough indicators to an unprejudiced mind that the crime of murder perpetrated by accused-appellant has been established with moral and legal certainty.




As to the other ground of accused-appellants’ appeal — the both complaining witnesses Salinda, Jr. and Helaos had stated to defense witness Pillado that nobody witnessed the attack, and that nobody could identify the perpetrators thereof — this Court can consider such testimony of Pillado as, at best, inaccurate, and at worst, of no probative value.


The records show that prosecution witness Salinda, Jr. testified as follows:

18








The foregoing testimonies belie the accuracy of Pillado’s own testimony. Such inaccuracy, however, can be explained. It is true that Salinda, Jr. and Helaos did not actually witness the first attack. But that is because the attack was so sudden and was, shortly afterwards, continued for another brief period by the accused-appellants, that Salinda, Jr. and Helaos could not have managed to get even a momentary glimpse of the actual attack as they themselves were in the midst of their own frantic effort to take cover. Moreover, their alleged statements to Pillado as testified to by the latter, that they could not identify the attackers, referred not to the difficulty in ascertaining the actual identities of the accused-appellants but rather, to the difficulty of ascertaining with precision the intended target of each assailant, in view of the type of weapons used — shotguns which have the capacity of hitting multiple targets with just a single shotgun shell — and the proximity of the intended victims from each other.


At the same time, the portion of the testimony of defense witness Pillado regarding the alleged subject statements of Salinda, Jr. and Helaos can be considered as nothing more than hearsay evidence. Precisely, Pillado had no personal knowledge of whether there were witnesses to the crimes as well as to the identities of the perpetrators. He only obtained, and later confused, such information from Salinda, Jr. and Helaos.


Under Rule 130, Section 36 of the Rules of Court, it is provided:








5.	TESTIMONIAL KNOWLEDGE




Sec. 36.	Testimony generally confined to personal knowledge; hearsay excluded. — A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception, except as otherwise provided in these rules.




Inasmuch as the related portion of the testimony of defense witness Pillado has no probative value — it being hearsay — it cannot sustain accused-appellants arguments and prayer for the reversal of the trial court’s decision, and their consequent acquittal of all the crimes for which they were correctly convicted.


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, of Isulan, Sultan Kudarat dated 7 February 1992, is hereby AFFIRMED 
en toto
.
