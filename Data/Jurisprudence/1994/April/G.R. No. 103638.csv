G.R. No. 103638	April 14, 1994


FIRST INTRAMUROS BF CONDOMINIUM CORPORATION and MAXY ABAD, 
petitioners,

vs.


NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION and NANCY DINGAYAN QUIMPO, 
respondents. 


Balgos & Perez for petitioners.


Nancy J. Dingayan-Quimpo for and in her own behalf.


R E S O L U T I O N




VITUG, 
J.:


This Petition for 
Certiorari
, with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, seeks to have the resolution, dated 24 September 1991, of the National Labor Relations Commission, which has affirmed the decision of 20 June 1990 of Labor Arbiter Manuel P. Asuncion, reversed and set aside.


On 01 February 1980, private respondent Nancy Dingayan Quimpo was employed by First Intramuros BF Condominium Corporation to be its Assistant Building Administrator for Finance and Administration. She, thereafter, received various promotions with corresponding increases in salary; in 1984, as senior Assistant Building Administrator; in 1985, as Building Administrator; and in 1986, as General Manager. In 1987, she was yet given another salary increase by petitioner corporation's president.


On 29 November 1988, private respondent received her 13th month pay based on her basic salary. She protested on the ground that it had been the company's policy to include other fringe benefits in the computation of the 13th month pay. Later, her salary was reverted to P8,107.50, the amount she was receiving in November 1987, on the excuse that the increase she was granted by the firm's president in December 1986 was not confirmed by the Board of Directors. Private respondent filed a complaint for underpayment, withholding of salary and diminution of her 13th month pay.


In a decision, dated 20 June 1990, Labor Arbiter Manuel P. Asuncion ruled:




WHEREFORE, the respondents are hereby ordered to pay the complainant;


1.)	The full amount of her salary at P22,311.24 per month, from December 1988, with legal interest;


2.)	13th month pay for 1987 in the amount of P6,200.00;


3.)	Moral and exemplary damages in the amount of P250,000.00


The respondents must, also, pay the equivalent of 10% percent of the benefits awarded as attorney's fee.


SO ORDERED. 
1




Petitioners appealed the Labor Arbiter's decision to the National Labor Relations Commission. On 24 September 1991, respondent commission issued the first questioned resolution, thus:




WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed Decision is hereby Affirmed and the appeal dismissed for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED. 
2




Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration. On 27 December 1991, the second questioned resolution was issued, thus:




WHEREFORE, in view thereof, the Commission's resolution in dispute must stand, and the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby dismissed for lack of merit. No further motion of similar nature shall be entertained.


SO ORDERED. 
3






On 07 February 1992, a petition for 
certiorari
, dated 27 January 1992, was filed with this court, asserting that —








1.	THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT ACTED WITHOUT OR BEYOND ITS JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT SUSTAINED THE DECISION OF THE LABOR ARBITER THAT THE INCREASES IN THE SALARY OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT WERE VALID;


2.	THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT ACTED WITHOUT OR BEYOND ITS JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT SUSTAINED PAYMENT TO THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT OF MORAL DAMAGES; AND


3.	THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT ACTED WITHOUT OR BEYOND ITS JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT SUSTAINED PAYMENT OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT OF ATTORNEY'S FEES.
4










Petitioners likewise prayed for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. In its resolution, dated 02 March 1992, this Court issued a temporary restraining order and required petitioners to post a cash or surety bond to be effective during the pendency of the case and until the judgment thereon is fully executed. 
5
 The temporary restraining order was later lifted in our resolution of 22 July 1992, on account of petitioners' failure to post another bond pursuant to our interim resolution of 18 May 1992. 
6
 On 23 September 1992, this Court resolved to give due course to the petition, and it required the parties to submit their respective memoranda.




On 15 February 1994, a ""Joint Motion to Render Decision Based on the Compromise Agreement,"" was filed with this Court, hereunder reproduced in full:
