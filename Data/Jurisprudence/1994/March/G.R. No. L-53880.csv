petitioners,

vs.


HON. GLICERIO V. CARRIAGA, JR. and CONCEPCION (CONCHITA) ALANIS PACETE, 
respondents.

VITUG, 
J.:


The issue in this petition for 
certiorari 
is whether or not the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Cotabato, Branch I, in Cotabato City, gravely abused its discretion in 
denying
 petitioners' motion for extension of time to file their answer in Civil Case No. 2518, in 
declaring
 petitioners in default and in 
rendering 
its decision of 17 March 1980 which, among other things, decreed the legal separation of petitioner Enrico L. Pacete and private respondent Concepcion Alanis and held to be null and void 
ab initio
 the marriage of Enrico L. Pacete to Clarita de la Concepcion. 


On 29 October 1979, Concepcion Alanis filed with the court below a complaint for the declaration of nullity of the marriage between her erstwhile husband Enrico L. Pacete and one Clarita de la Concepcion, as well as for legal separation (between Alanis and Pacete), accounting and separation of property. In her complaint, she averred that she was married to Pacete on 30 April 1938 before the Justice of the Peace of Cotabato, Cotabato; that they had a child named Consuelo who was born on 11 March 1943; that Pacete subsequently contracted (in 1948) a second marriage with Clarita de la Concepcion in Kidapawan, North Cotabato; that she learned of such marriage only on 01 August 1979; that during her marriage to Pacete, the latter acquired vast property consisting of large tracts of land, fishponds and several motor vehicles; that he fraudulently placed the several pieces of property either in his name and Clarita or in the names of his children with Clarita and other ""dummies;"" that Pacete ignored overtures for an amicable settlement; and that reconciliation between her and Pacete was impossible since he evidently preferred to continue living with Clarita.


The defendants were each served with summons on 15 November 1979. They filed a motion for an extension of twenty (20) days from 30 November 1979 within which to file an answer. The court granted the motion. On 18 December 1979, appearing through a new counsel, the defendants filed a second motion for an extension of another thirty (30) days from 20 December 1979. On 07 January 1980, the lower court granted the motion but only for twenty (20) days to be counted from 20 December 1979 or until 09 January 1980. The Order of the court was mailed to defendants' counsel on 11 January 1980. Likely still unaware of the court order, the defendants, on 05 February 1980, again filed another motion (dated 18 January 1980) for an extension of ""fifteen (15) days counted from the expiration of the 30-day period previously sought"" within which to file an answer. The following day, or on 06 February 1980, the court denied this last motion on the ground that it was ""filed after the original period given . . . as first extension had expired.""
1


The plaintiff thereupon filed a motion to declare the defendants in default, which the court forthwith granted. The plaintiff was then directed to present her evidence.
2
 The court received plaintiff's evidence during the hearings held on 15, 20, 21 and 22 February 1980.


On 17 March 1980, the court
3


 promulgated the herein questioned decision, disposing of the case, thus —

Hence, the instant special civil action of 
certiorari
.


Under ordinary circumstances, the petition would have outrightly been dismissed, for, as also pointed out by private respondents, the proper remedy of petitioners should have instead been either to appeal from the judgment by default or to file a petition for relief from judgment.
5
 This rule, however, is not inflexible; a petition for 
certiorari 
is allowed when the default order is 
improperly 
declared, or even when it is
 properly 
declared, where grave abuse of discretion attended such declaration.
6
 In these exceptional instances, the special civil action of 
certiorari 
to declare the nullity of a judgment by default is available.
7
 In the case at bench, the default order unquestionably is not legally sanctioned. The Civil Code provides:




Art. 101.	No decree of legal separation shall be promulgated upon a stipulation of facts or by confession of judgment.


In case of non-appearance of the defendant, the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to inquire whether or not a collusion between the parties exists. If there is no collusion, the prosecuting attorney shall intervene for the State in order to take care that the evidence for the plaintiff is not fabricated.




The provision has been taken from Article 30 of the California Civil Code,
8
 and it is, in substance, reproduced in Article 60 of the Family Code.
9


Article 101 reflects the public policy on marriages, and it should easily explain the mandatory tenor of the law. In 
Brown v
. 
Yambao
, 
10
 the Court has observed:




The policy of Article 101 of the new Civil Code, calling for the intervention of the state attorneys in case of uncontested proceedings for legal separation (and of annulment of marriages, under Article 88), is to emphasize that marriage is more than a mere contract; that it is a social institution in which the state is vitally interested, so that its continuation or interruption can not be made to depend upon the parties themselves (Civil Code, Article 52; Adong vs. Cheong Gee, 43 Phil. 43; Ramirez v. Gmur, 42 Phil. 855; Goitia v. Campos, 35 Phil. 252). It is consonant with this policy that the inquiry by the Fiscal should be allowed to focus upon any relevant matter that may indicate whether the proceedings for separation or annulment are fully justified or not.




Article 103 of the Civil Code, now Article 58 of the Family Code, further mandates that an action for legal separation must ""in no case be tried before six months shall have elapsed since the filing of the petition,"" obviously in order to provide the parties a ""cooling-off"" period. In this interim, the court should take steps toward getting the parties to reconcile.


The significance of the above substantive provisions of the law is further underscored by the inclusion of the following provision in Rule 18 of the Rules of Court:




Sec. 6.	
No defaults in actions for annulments of marriage or for legal separation
. — If the defendant in an action for annulment of marriage or for legal separation fails to answer, the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to investigate whether or not a collusion between the parties exists, and if there is no collusion, to intervene for the State in order to see to it that the evidence submitted is not fabricated.




The special prescriptions on actions that can put the integrity of marriage to possible jeopardy are impelled by no less than the State's interest in the marriage relation and its avowed intention not to leave the matter within the exclusive domain and the vagaries of the parties to alone dictate.


It is clear that the petitioner did, in fact, specifically pray for legal separation. 
11
 That other remedies, whether principal or incidental, have likewise been sought in the same action cannot dispense, nor excuse compliance, with any of the statutory requirements aforequoted.


WHEREFORE, the petition for
 certiorari 
is hereby GRANTED and the proceedings below, including the Decision of 17 March 1980 appealed from, are NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE. No costs.


SO ORDERED.


Feliciano, Bidin, Romero and Melo, JJ., concur.
