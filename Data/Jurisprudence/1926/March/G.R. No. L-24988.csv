STATEMENT


October 14, 1910, Gregorio Yulo y Regalado, then 37 years of age, executed a mortgage to and in favor of the commercial house of Francisco Manzano Yap Tico, through its attorney-in-fact, Yap Eng Chong, on his regular plantation, in consideration of which and at the time, the firm advanced Yulo the sum of P15,000. It was stipulated in the mortgage that the debt should draw interest at the rate of 10 per cent annum, and that the original debt, ""as well as such obligations as are herein contained,"" should become due and payable about the month of May, 1911. It was contemplated by both parties that the debt should be paid by Yulo by the delivery and sale of sugar produced on his plantation. This was followed by another like instrument of date November 24, 1911, including some other property, in which it is recited that ""on account of the fact that the fields of said 
haciendas 
were burned,"" and ""for the purpose of obtaining an extension of that debt up to June 30, 1912, and to increase the credit of P15,000 by the amount of P8,000, Philippine currency, to attend to the necessities of the 
haciendas Tongo 
and 
Napay
,"" that the amount of the original debt should be increased to P23,000, P8,000 of which was then advanced, and that the total amount should draw interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum. 


If further appears that on October 22, 1922, there was a settlement between the parties in which it was agreed that there was then due and owing the firm, the sum of P20,065.20. It also appears that the firm from the time to time and in different amounts continued to advance money to Yulo, and that Yulo continued and at different times delivered sugar to the plaintiff; that the last money advanced to Yulo was on July 30, 1918; and that Yulo made his last delivery of sugar on May 30, 1915, amounting to P1,181.43. Apparently such items are the last debits and credits between the parties. 


Yulo, having died Jose Lopez Vito was appointed as administrator of his estate. In the ordinary course of business, commissioners on claims were appointed to whom the firm duly presented its claim, and, for some unknown reason, no part of it was allowed. 


From that decision the firm appealed to the Court of First Instance where it sought to establish its claim against the estate for P72,496.48. 


At the trial before the court, the parties entered into the following stipulation: 




The parties agree that the chits signed by Gregorio Yulo and Meliton Fernandez represent the amounts and goods by said Gregorio Yulo on the date shown therein; that the defendant does not admit nor recognize such items set forth in the statement of accounts which the plaintiff presents as Exhibit C, as are not evidenced by receipts or chits signed by Gregorio Yulo or Meliton Fernandez or Jose Yulo.


That the defendant alleges as special defense in this case that plaintiff's action has already prescribed as to the amounts shown in the statement of accounts in Exhibit C taken up to October 14, 1914; that the value of the sugar delivered after October 14, 1914, must be applied upon the payment of the amounts taken by Gregorio Yulo, evidenced by chits or receipts subsequent to October 14, 1914; that the document marked Exhibit A is one signed by Gregorio Yulo on the date shown therein; that the document marked Exhibit D is one signed by Gregorio Yulo on the date shown therein; that the receipts and chits marked Exhibits B-1 to B-39 are the vouchers of the items shown in Exhibit C referred to in said receipts and chits; that Exhibit C is an abstract of the debit and credit of the account of the deceased Gregorio Yulo in the books of the plaintiff written in Chinese.


That Exhibits E-1 to E-4 are the report of the commissioners of appraisal; the claim of the plaintiff filed with the commissioners; the notice of the hearing of the claim; and a receipt of the commissioners of the copies of chits B-1 to B-39.


That the plaintiff has made demand on the defendant for the payment of the amount claimed in the complaint, and said defendant has not paid the same.


That the plaintiff corporation is the successor of F. M. Yap Tico.


That with the facts herein agreed upon and the defense of the defendant, the parties submit the case to the court for judgment.




The lower court held that, as to all or that portion of plaintiff's claim filed before the commissioners which was contracted prior to October 14, 1914, had prescribed under the provisions of paragraph 1, of section 43, of the Code of Civil Procedure, and upon that theory held that the proceeding in so far as it is founded upon Exhibits B-1 to B-24, inclusive, is barred by the statute of limitations, and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the estate of Gregorio Yulo for the sum of P11,860.72, plus P10,222.84, with legal interest upon P10,222.84 from October 15, 1924, until the date of payment, together with the costs. 


Plaintiff appeals and assigns the following errors: 




1. The court erred in considering that the statute of limitations is applicable to this case, and that the right of action of plaintiff against the defendant for a certain portion of the indebtedness set out in the complaint has prescribed.


2. The court erred in not allowing interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum on the principal after the date on which the decision was written in this case.


3. The court erred in not rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of the principal demanded in the complaint.




JOHNS, 
J.:


The first question is whether or not, as the trial court held, all of plaintiffs claim prior to October 14, 1914, is barred under the provisions of section 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 


It is admitted that on October 22, 1912 the parties then had a settlement of all of their previous mutual dealings, in which it was agreed that Yulo was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of P20,065.20, and for which he gave the firm a chit on that date. There is no evidence of any other settlement. Be that as it may, on October 24, 1912, Yulo signed a chit to and in favor of the plaintiff for P1,000, and from time to time signed the following chits on the specified dates for the following amounts:
