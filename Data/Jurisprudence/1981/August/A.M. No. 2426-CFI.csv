vs.


JUDGE JESUS DE VEGA, 
respondent.
 




BARREDO, 
J.:


Administrative complaint dated September 30, 1980 against respondent judge, complainant alleging to be the victim of an unjust decision, ""knowingly"" rendered by said respondent and also ignorance of the law. Deputy Court Administrator, Hon. Romeo D. Mendoza, referred the said complaint to respondent on November 10, 1980 for comment, which respondent filed in a 2nd Indorsement dated December 12, 1980. A reply to said comment was filed by complainant on Feb 16,1981. 


We have carefully read the allegations of complainant in his complaint and reply, together with the annexes, and We have done the same to the comment of respondent. After meticulous study and mature deliberation on the report submitted by the Deputy Court Administrator, concurred in by Hon. Lorenzo Relova, the Court Administrator, We are fully convinced that the complaint lacks sufficient merit for further action against respondent. 


WHEREFORE, the complaint is hereby dismissed. Let a copy of the report of the Office of the Court Administrator above-referred to, which is made part hereof by reference, be furnished the parties together with this decision. 


Fernando, C.J., Makasiar, Aquino, Concepcion Jr., Fernandez, Guerrero, Abad Santos, De Castro and Melencio-Herrera, JJ., concur. 


Teehankee, J., took no part.
