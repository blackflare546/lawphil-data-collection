Subsequently, the trial court conducted hearings for the reception of the prosecution's evidence. The prosecution presented as witnesses T/Sgt. Orlando D. Acierto, PC Investigator, stationed at Camp Conrado T. Yap, Iba, Zambales, Catalino Manipon, CIS Agent-Investigator, Manolo Dizon, police investigator, Makati Police Department, Capt..Roman P. Madella, Commander of the 162nd PC Company, at Camp Conrado T. Yap, Iba, Zambales, Dionisio Bengzon, Chief of Security at Forbes Park, Dr. Orlando V. Salvador, the physician who conducted the autopsy on the body of the deceased, and Remy Macaspac, Patrolman, Makati, Police Department and a number of documentary evidence. 


The evidence disclosed the following facts: 


At about 11:00 p.m. of October 31, 1971, accused Silvestre Mate, together with Albino Ben Bohol, gained entrance into the yard of Mr. Charles Butler at No. 15 Ipil Road, Forbes Park, Makati, Rizal. They stayed in the guesthouse within the yard until the morning of November 1, 1971. At about 7:30 a.m., Mate noticed' a man and a woman approach the guesthouse, but they did not enter. About thirty minutes later a woman entered the guesthouse. Mate and Bohol were hiding and watching her movements. Later, both Mate and Bohol approached the woman, who turned out to be the victim, Martina Caldoza. Martina, surprised and afraid upon seeing the two, shouted for assistance. Mate held Martina, trying to stop her from shouting. At that moment Ben Bohol hit Martina on the head with the handle of the shotgun. When Martina became unconscious and fell Ben Bohol stabbed her twice at the back with a screwdriver. Mate and Bohol brought the woman to the bathroom of the guesthouse where Ben Bohol again repeatedly stabbed her until she died. 


Five minutes afterwards, Mrs. Butler approached the guesthouse as if looking for something. Mate who was watching the movement of Mrs. Butler, pointed the shotgun at her and told her not to shout. Mrs. Butler, surprised and afraid, shouted for help and tried to run away. Mate shot her at the back with the shotgun. Mate, then, proceeded hurriedly, through the kitchen, into the house of the Butlers. He ordered a woman he met inside the house to accompany him to the bedroom. Inside bedroom, Mate saw Suzie Butler who accompanied Mate inside one of the rooms.

When the police authorities came, they surrounded the place, and Mate held Suzie Butler as a hostage inside the locked room. The uncle of Suzie tried to negotiate with Mate for the release of Suzie. Mate stated that he wanted to talk with newspaperman Ruther Batiguas. Batiguas was allowed to enter the room bringing with him food. The uncle of Suzie was also allowed by Mate to enter the room. They negotiated for the amount of ransom money needed to release Suzie. Mate eventually accepted P15,000.00 provided he would be brought by helicopter to his desired place for escape. The police officers agreed. About 3:00 p.m. of the same day, Mate, Suzie, her uncle, and Batiguas rode the helicopter that had been provided and they were all flown to Botolan, Zambales. They landed in Pulong Bato, Botolan, Zambales, at about 5:30 p.m. of November 1, 1971. The P15,000.00 was given to Mate by the uncle of Suzie and Suzie was released. Mate remained, while the group left in the same helicopter.

Mate went to the house of Mr. Juan Dizon at Pulong Bato, Botolan, Zambales, where he stayed the night of November 1, 1971. At about 3:00 a.m. of November 2,1971, Mr. Dizon woke up Mate and brought him to Sitio Paitan, because Mate would be arrested by the BSDV. In a small hut at Sitio Paitan, Mate was arrested by the PC. 
9


Capt. Roman P. Madella of the 162nd PC stationed at Iba, Zambales, led the group that apprehended Mate. they recovered money from Mate tot he amount of P13,553.00. A shotgun was also recovered. 
10


When investigated, Mate voluntarily made his extra-judicial statements contained in Exhibit ""A"". 
11
 
On November 3, 1971, Investigator Catalino Manipon of the CIS investigated mate. Mate again voluntarily gave his extra-judicial statements contained in Exhibit ""B"". 
12
 
In Exhibit ""B"", Mate revealed the brown suitcase he brought to the Butler residence containing things needed to commit the crime. He also revealed his well prepared plan to kidnap the children of the Butlers for ransom. 
13
 
Police Investigator Manolo Dizon crroborated Mate's confession about the brown suitcase containing things to be used in the crime when Dizon testified that said brown suitcase, together with its contents, was recovered from the scene of the crime. 
14


Before Patrolman Remy Macaspac of the Makati Police Force, Mate again voluntarily executed his extra-judicial confession Exhibit ""J"". 
15
 
Exhibit ""J"" contains detailed narration of how the crime was planned and committed, and its contents substantially are in harmony with the narration of Exhibits ""A"" and ""B"".


Long after the accused Mate had been convicted by the trial court in this case in 1971, he testified on May 7, 1973 as witness for the prosecution agaist his co-accused in the crime, Albino Bohol. Mate affirmed the same narrations of events contained in his extra-judicial confessions Exhibits ""A"", ""B"" and ""J"", and even elaborated on them. 
16


The defense contends that the trial court committed a serious error in rendereing judgment of conviction immediately after Mate had pleaded guilty to the crime charged on the basis of his plea of guilty and before receiving any evidence. While the trial court committed an error in rendering judgment immediately after the accused had pleaded guilty, and, tereafter, conducted hearings for the reception of the evidence for the prosecution, such an irregularity, is insufficient to justify the setting aside fo the judgment of conviction, considering that it is supported by the judicial and extra-judicial confessions of the accused and by other evidence. Thus, in the of 
People vs. Dumdum,
 
17
 
this Court held:




The trial court committed an irregularity in pronouncing judgment on the two accused in open court immediately after they had pleaded guilty and then later on requiring the prosecution to present evidence.


However, the irregularity does not justify the setting aside of the judgment of conviction which is supported by the judicial and extra-judicial confessions of the accused and other evidence. 
18




The defense questions also the failure of the state prosecutor Cornelio Melendres to make a formal offer of his exhibits, although they have been marked and identified. Such an oversight appears trivial because the entire evidence for the prosecution is recorded. Even without the exhibits which have been incorporated into the records of the case, the prosecution can still establish the case because the witnesses properly identified those exhibits and their testimonies are recorded.


Exhibits ""A"", ""B"", and ""J"" are all admissible against Mate because it appears with clarity that he voluntarily and spontaneously gave those narrations without compulsion from anybody, In fact, ... when he testified against Been Bohol he affirmed those narrations again.


This Court cannot give much credence to the possible mental aberration or abnormality of the accused Mate just because he narrated with elaborate details the execution of the crime.


On the contrary, We believe that the narration of the accused showed he possesses above average intelligence and a rather keen recollection. Mate even described how he planned to commit the crime, reciting the details in a thorough manner. His actual execution of the crime and manner of escape showed cunning and perception. The argument that no sane person would voluntarily confess to a crime realizing that he would surely face death, deserves but scant consideration, for if We give weight to the same, all voluntary confessions should be presumed as emanating from insane persons, contrary to the general presumption of sanity of a person. The conscience of a man can overwhelm his love of life. 


WHEREFORE, the decision of conviction being in accordance with law and the evidence, is hereby AFFIRMED in its entirety, with costs. 


SO ORDERED. 


Teehankee, Makasiar, Concepcion, Jr., Fernandez, Guerrero, Abad Santos, De Castro and Melencio-Herrera, JJ., concur. 


Fernando, CJ., took no part. 






Separate Opinions




AQUINO, 
J., 
concurring: 


I concur in the imposition of the death penalty. The accused committed three separate crimes. With respect to Susan Butler, the accused is guilty of kidnapping for ransom for which the penalty is death. 


For the killing of Martina Caldoza, he is guilty of the separate crime of murder for which the penalty is 
reclusion perpetua
. 


For the assault on Caroline Butler, the accused is guilty of frustrated homicide. The penalty imposable on him for that crime is six years of 
prision correccional 
as minimum to ten years of 
prision mayor 
as maximum. 


But since the accused did not appeal, the penalties for the other two offenses cannot now be imposed upon him.
