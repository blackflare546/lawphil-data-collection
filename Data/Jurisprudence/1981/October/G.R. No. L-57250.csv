THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 


Plaintiff does hereby reproduces and incorporate as part hereof, all the allegations stated under the first and second cause of action in this complaint, and thus respectively aver: 






I 






That as a legal consequence of the Promissory Note and the Chattel Mortgage Contract the defendants had made and entered into with the plaintiff as promisee and/or as mortgagee thereof, there a certain right is created in favor of the plaintiff, the breach thereof, either through the manipulation of legal maneuvers or through any other means by the defendants purposely to evade payments of a certain obligations, which incidentally, is exactly, what the defendants had done here, there entitles the plaintiff for damages under the provision of Article 19 of the New Civil Code, which says: 






Every person must, in the exercise of his rights, and in the performance thereof, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.










II






That on August 16, 1979, that is several months after the defendants had failed to pay their obligation with the plaintiff, to the latter's surprise, the defendants after having received several demands from the plaintiff, through counsel, in clear abuse of their rights under the provisions of the Article above-mentioned and basically, for a certain purpose to evade the fulfillment of their obligations with the plaintiff, had maliciously filed a groundless suit in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch XXV thereof, for specific performance against the plaintiff; 






III






That actually, said action for Specific performance was filed in bad faith and basically to evade and/or delay the payments of their obligation with the plaintiff. It was made for no other purpose except to defeat the rights of the plaintiff under the law; 






IV






That with the filing of the defendant's most malicious complaint against the plaintiff, the latter had suffered mental anguish, fright, anxieties and certainly such wounded feeling, where the amount of P200,000.00 had been asked and prayed for to compensate the plaintiff for his moral damages; 






V






That with the filing of the defendant's most malicious complaint against the plaintiff there an abuse of a right had been committed by the defendants, in which case, as a corrective measure against them, the amount of P 30,000.00 should be imposed by way of example or correction for the public good; ...

				NEVILLE Y. LAMIS ENTS 							By: (Sgd.) NEVILLE Y. LAMIS 							Proprietor/Gen. Manager 


				Davao City, Philippines, January 27, 1979. 






By motion dated February 18, 1981, which the defendant filed in Civil Case No. 1395, the dismissal of the complaint was sought on the following grounds: 






(1)	THAT THE SUBJECT IS IN 'LIS PENDENS' AND/OR 'MULTIPLICITY OF SUIT' OF A PRIOR AND EXISTING CIVIL CASE NO. 35199 ENTITLED NEVILLE Y. LAMIS ENTS PLAINTIFF VERSUS SANTIAGO MANINGO, DEFENDANT, BEFORE CFI PASIG, BRANCH XXV FILED ON NOVEMBER 16, 1979. 


(2)	THAT VENUE IN THE HEREIN CASE IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED TO BE IMPROPERLY LAID.






On the question of venue it is alleged that the proper venue for Civil Case No. 1395 should be Davao City where the plaintiff resides and as stipulated in the promissory note dated February 26, 1979 and in the chattel mortgage dated February 27, 1979. However, the respondent judge found that Maningo has ""not only legal residence but also physical residence in Busaon, Tagum Davao"" and We are not inclined to disturb this finding Anent the claim that Davao City had been stipulated the venue, suffice it to say that a stipulation as to venue does not preclude the filing of suits in the residence of plaintiff or defendant under Section 2 (b), Rule 4, Rules of Court, in f he absence of qualifying or restrictive words in the agreement which would indicate that the place named is the only venue agreed upon by the parties The stipulation did not deprive Maningo of his right to pursue remedy in the court specifically mentioned in Section 2 (b) of Rule 4, Rules of Court. 
Renuntiato non praesumitur
. (Polytrade Corporation vs. Blanco, No. L-27033,Oct.31, 1969,30 SCRA187.) 


However, We believe that the first ground invoked in the motion to dismiss is well-taken; the respondent judge should have dismissed, Civil Case No. 1395 on that ground. 


Rule 16, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Court provides that a motion to dismiss an action may be made, 
inter alia
, on the ground that ""there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause.""


It has been said that for this ground to be invoked ""there must be, between the action under consideration and the other action, (1) Identity of parties, or at least such as representing the same interest in both actions; (2) Identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (3) the Identity on the two preceding particulars should be such that any judgment which may be rendered on the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to 
res adjudicata 
in the action under consideration."" (1 Moran, Rules of Court, pp. 488-489 [1970].) 


The petitioner contends that in so far as the complaint in Civil Case No. 1395 seeks to collect the P 55,000 alleged loan, it should be dismissed on the ground of 
litis pendencia
 because there is another case on the same cause pending between them in the Court of First Instance of Rizal And with respect to the claim for P 200,000, the same can not be set up in the present action on the ground of multiplicity of suits since Santiago Maningo's claim under the deed of chattel mortgage (over the tractor) partook of a compulsory counterclaim which not having been set up in Civil Case No. 35199 was forever barred under See. 4, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court. 


The private respondent, on the other hand, states that although the causes of action in Civil Case No. 1395 arose from the Memorandum Agreement sued upon in Civil Case No. 35199, the respective causes of action in the two cases are distinct in nature. He claims that Civil Case No. 35199 is basically for the performance of certain supposedly valid obligations whereas Civil Case No. 1395 is principally for collection of over due accounts. He also argues that on the assumption that the petitioner succeeds in compelling the private respondents to perform under the Memorandum Agreement, the private respondent would not be barred from seeking judgment in a separate case for the loan and the purchase price of the tractor. Finally, he maintains that the evidence to support the claims in the two actions are not the same. 


We find the position of the petitioner tenable. The claim of the private respondent for P55,000 admittedly arose from the same transaction i.e., the Memorandum of Agreement sued upon in Civil Case No. 35199, notwithstanding that no mention of the agreement is made in Civil Case No. 1395. Moreover, it appears that in the answer with a counter-claim filed by the private respondent as the defendant in Civil Case No. 35199, the same amount of P55,000 was demanded of the plaintiff therein. Indubitably, in the resolution of the issues of facts and law in Civil Case No. 35199, relative to the claimed amount, the right of the private respondent thereto will have to be passed upon. 


Similarly the private respondent's claim for the purchase price of the tractor is barred. This claim should have been set up in Civil Case No. 35199, of which, in one of the causes of action it was alleged that there was a misdelivery of tractor for which reason the plaintiff therein asks for the delivery of the tractor specified in the Memorandum Agreement. 


In 
Yu Lay v. Galmes
 (40 Phil. 651 [1920]), a counterclaim is compulsory if (a) it matured before answer; (b) it arises out of or is necessarily connected with the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim; (c) it does not require for its adjudication the presence of third persons of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction; and (d) it is within the jurisdiction of the court. And in 
Carpena v. Manalo
, (L-13143, April 26, 1961, 1 SCRA 1060), it was held that where the claim is necessarily connected with or arise out of the transaction involved in the first case, the same claim is barred if not set up as a counterclaim in the previous case. 


It is clear that in the light of the jurisprudence cited, the private respondent's claim for the purchase price of the tractor is in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim and to allow it in the present action will violate the principle against multiplicity of suits. 


WHEREFORE, the petition is granted; the order of the respondent judge dated April 2, 1981 in Civil Case No. 1395 is hereby set aside and another one entered ordering the dismissal of said case. No special pronouncement as to costs. 


SO ORDERED.
