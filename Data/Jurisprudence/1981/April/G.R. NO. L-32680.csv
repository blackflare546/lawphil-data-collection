On March 19, 1981 the parties filed the following. 




JOINT MANIFESTATION AND MOTION 


COME NOW the parties, assisted by counsel and respectfully manifest: 


1.	The protracted litigation involved in the above-entitled case has deprived the parties of productive use of the land. On the other hand, a number of people in the City of Cavite has entertained the false belief that the land in question is an abandoned property and, thus, has subjected it to abuse and illegal occupation and exploitation 


2.	Because of its strategic location and due to unavailability of land to fill the expanding needs of Cavite City, the area is Ideal for urban development. In fact, a portion of the land has been designated as a BLISS site in line with the developmental plan of the National Government; and 


3.	The parties, therefore, after exploring all avenues to compromise having in mind the public interest have arrived at a settlement as evidenced by the Compromise Agreement hereto attached as Annex ""A"". 


WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is respectfully prayed that: 


(a)	The Compromise Agreement marked as Annex ""A"" here of approved, and that judgment be entered in accordance with the terms thereof; and 


(b)	The case be remanded to the lower court for further proceedings for the issuance of a decree or decrees of registration pursuant to the Compromise Agreement.
