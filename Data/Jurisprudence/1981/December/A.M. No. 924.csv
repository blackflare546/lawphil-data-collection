SECOND DIVISION 


A.M. No. 924	December 28, 1981


RENATO M. CORONADO, 
complainant,

vs.


ATTORNEY ANGEL S. HUERTAS, 
respondent.




FERNANDO, 
CJ.:


The complaint for disbarment filed against respondent Angel S. Huertas, former Municipal Judge of Ragay, Camarines Sur, was based on his having allegedly falsified the information sheet which the Commission on Appointments required as a prerequisite to the confirmation of his appointment as municipal judge. More specifically, he was accused of stating in his information sheet that he had no previous administrative case, when in truth and in fact the Civil Service Board of Appeals had affirmed a decision finding him guilty of dishonesty (falsification of daily time records) and gross misconduct, for which he was dismissed from the government service, when he was then Senior Inspector of the Fiber Inspection Service. In his Answer, respondent specifically denied such allegation, ""the truth of the matter,"" according to him, ""being that the Civil Service Board of Appeals confirmed [his] dismissal by the Fiber Inspection Service, which confirmation came after the City Fiscal of the City of Manila discussed the criminal case filed by the Fiber Inspection Service against the respondent for falsification, the same charge of which he was accused by the Fiber Inspection Service in an administrative charge and which dismissal of said criminal case extinguished the respondent's criminal and civil liabilities.""
