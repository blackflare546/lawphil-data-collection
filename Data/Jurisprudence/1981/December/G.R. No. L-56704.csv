PETROPHIL CORPORATION, 
petitioner,

vs.


HON. BLAS OPLE, in his capacity as Minister of Labor and Employment, and MALAYANG MANGGAGAWA SA ESSO, 
respondents.




FERNANDEZ, 
J.:


This is a petition to review the order of the Minister of Labor dated March 16, 1981 issued in Case No. 64-IPA entitled

 on the ground that the Minister of Labor and Employment exceeded his jurisdiction in ordering the reinstatement of all workers belonging to the respondent, Malayang Manggagawa sa Esso (MME) who were terminated by ESSO on December 8, 1967 and that said Minister abused his discretion in finding that the 1968 and 1971 bargaining agreements did not validly supersede the 1963 bargaining agreement and consequently ordering the reinstatement of assistant tank truck drivers and helpers and fillers and the restoration of meal and transportation allowances to workers assigned to MIA and JOCASP Units.


After the respondent, Minister of Labor and Employment, had filed his comment, the petitioner and private respondent submitted on December 4, 1981 the following:
