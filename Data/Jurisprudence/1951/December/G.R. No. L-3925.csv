The question to be decided is whether the sale of textile goods by the appellee to tailors, shirt factories, taxicab companies and schools, upon which the license fee was levied and collected, was wholesale or retail. 


The appellee was a merchant licensed to import and sell dry goods at wholesale and ran a store at No. 712 Ilaya, Manila, where he sold dry goods at retail and paid the minimum quarterly license fee imposed upon retailers, as provided by the Ordinance No. 3028 for the first and fourth quarters of 1947 and for the first, second and third quarters of 1948, amounting to P175. 


The quantity of goods sold by a merchant, the habitual sale of such goods made by him and the license issued to him to engage in business may be indicative but are not determine of the character of a particular sale of goods made by him. The test to determine whether a particular sale of goods or merchandise is wholesale or retail is the use made or to be made by the purchaser of such goods or merchandise. If it be resale at profit, the goods being unaltered when resold, the quantity of the goods sold being large not to be used by the purchaser or in excess of the requirements of his business and the merchant selling the goods being habitually engaged in the sale of which goods in large quantities to his customers, then it may be deemed wholesale. Otherwise, it is retail. The fact that the purchaser them by using his skill or a process to secure better price for the altered goods or manufactured products does not make the previous sale a wholesale. It is still retail. The fact that the purchasers — the tailors, shirt factories, taxicab companies and schools — transformed such dry goods bought from the appellee into suits shirts and other garments, used them for seat covers, or sold them to their employees and to their teachers and students does not convert the sale made by the appellee into wholesale and the tailors, shirt factories, taxicab companies and schools into retailers. They were consumers in legal contemplation because they used the goods purchased by them. The retail sale of copra for the manufacture of soap or oleomargarine, of hemp used to make twine or rope into the manufacture of finished products, cannot be deemed wholesale by the mere fact that the copra, hemp and raw materials are sold in altered from to the ultimate consumer. 


Moreover, it appears from the fifth paragraph of the stipulation that during the same period for which the license fees was levied and collected, the appellee sold textiles in large quantities in firms and individuals for resale upon which no license fee was levied and collected. This fact is an additional proof and reason for holding that the sale of textile goods made by the appellee to tailors, shirt factories, taxicab companies and schools during the first and fourth quarters of 1947 and from the first to the third quarter of 1948, upon which the license fee was levied and collected pursuant to Ordinance No. 3028, was not wholesale but retail. 


The court below found that the appellee's wholesale business was subject to the payment of a municipal license fee and concluded that the sale of goods upon which the tax or license fee was imposed was not authorized by the very provisions of section 1 of Ordinance No. 3028. Such finding is not supported by the stipulation of facts. If the court below had in mind the percentage tax on sales of dry goods, as provided for in section 186 of Commonwealth Act No. 466, as amended by Republic Act No. 41, it is not municipal but national. If it had in mind the fee of P5 for permit to run a store in the city, as required by Ordinance No. 3000, such fee is not a municipal tax which could prevent the levy and collection of the municipal tax or license fee provided by in Ordinance No. 3028, as authorized by the enabling statute — section 2444 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 3669 and Commonwealth Act No. 76. 


Although not raised by the appellants the question of the real parties in interest crops up. The appellants are not the real parties in interest in this case. Section 2429 of the Revised Penal Code, which was reenacted in section 3 of Republic Act No. 409, grants the City of Manila the authority to sue and be sued. We have not run across any Act of Congress which gives any one the authority to sue the City Mayor and Treasurer in lieu of the city of Manila as a public corporation. Any judgment that could be rendered against them for refund of license fees unlawfully levied and collected would be unenforceable against the City of Manila, and the funds of the latter in the possession or control of said officers could not be paid or disbursed by them to satisfy such judgment. 


The judgment appealed from is reversed, the complaint dismissed, with costs against the appellee.
