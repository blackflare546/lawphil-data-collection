The defendant appealed directly to this Court, there being no questions of fact but only of law.


The defendant-appellant makes the following contentions:


(1)	That during the Japanese occupation the principal obligation with the interest due thereon, was extinguished or at least the accrual of the interest was suspended;


(2)	That he is not liable to pay attorney's fees;


(3)	That the commandeering or seizure of the truck by the United States Armed Forces of the Far East USAFFE relieved the appellant from paying the balance of its price to the plaintiff; and


(4)	That the payment of the obligation is suspended by the Moratorium Proclamation.


There is no principle of law by virtue of which the obligation was extinguished during the Japanese occupation. However, the appellant claims that at least the accrual of the interest was stopped; that is, the indebtedness did not bear interest during the Japanese occupation. This question is purely academic, for as seen from paragraph 3 of the agreed statement of facts, the plaintiff appellee was generous enough to demand interest only from October 6, 1948, very much after the termination of the Japanese occupation.


With regard to the attorney's fees amounting to 25 per cent of the obligation, this Court, in the use of its discretion, reduces it to 10 per cent, or P286.12.


As to the theory that the seizure of the truck by the (USAFFE) relieved the appellant from paying the balance of its value to the plaintiff, it is enough to say that in the first place, the truck became the property of the appellant when it was delivered to him by the appellee, and consequently, the appellant should suffer the loss; and, in the second place, the appellant could have filed a claim with the United States Government and he would have been paid. His negligent omission cannot be imputed to the appellee. The appellant says that it should have been the appellee who should have filed the claim; the appellee could not have done so, because it was no longer the owner of the vehicle.


With reference to the Moratorium Proclamation which, the appellant claims, bars the collection of the obligation, it is enough to say that the Moratorium has been lifted as to obligation incurred before the war, except as to those who have filed claims with the United States Philippines War Damage Commission, which has not been done by the appellant. The motratorium cannot, therefore, be invoked by him.


In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, but the attorney's fees is reduced to 10 per cent, or P286.12. With costs against the appellant.


It is so ordered.
