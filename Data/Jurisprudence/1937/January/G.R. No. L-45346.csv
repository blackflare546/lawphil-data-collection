G.R. No. L-45346             January 30, 1937


THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
 plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


ENGRACIA SILVERIO (alias ENGRACIA DE SANTOS, ENGRACIA SANTOS),
 defendant-appellant.


Eriberto de Silva for appellant.

Undersecretary of Justice Melencio for appellee.


ABAD SANTOS, 
J.:


Having pleaded guilty to an information charging her with the crime of 
estafa
, the appellant  was sentenced by the Court of First Instance of Manila to six months and one day of 
 prision correccional
, to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P205, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs. 


In support of this appeal it is now contended that the lower court erred in not appreciating in favor of the appellant the mitigating circumstances of her having entered a plea of guilty. This contention is without merit. The amount alleged in the information to have been embezzled or misappropriated by the appellant is P205. The penalty prescribed for the offense thus committed is 
arresto mayor
 in its maximum period to
 prision correccional
 in its minimum period. (Revised Penal Code, article 315, case 3.)  Appreciating in favor of the appellant the mitigating circumstances of plea of guilty, the prescribed penalty should be impose in its minimum period, that is, from four months and one days of 
arresto mayor
 to one year of 
 prision correccional
.  It is within the sound discretion of trial court to fix the penalty within the range allowed by law. The penalty of six months and one day of 
 prision correccional
 imposed upon the appellant is within the proper range.


The judgment appealed from is, therefore, affirmed with costs against the appellant. So ordered.


Avanceña, C.J., Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel and Concepcion, JJ., concur.
