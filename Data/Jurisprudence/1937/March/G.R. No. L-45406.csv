DIAZ, 
J.:


Posecuted for attempted trespass to dwelling and convicted thereof upon his voluntary confession of guilt made before the evidence was presented by the prosecution, Pedro Nolasco y Rubio was sentenced by the Court of First Instance of Manila to one month of 
arresto menor 
and to pay fine of P200. Not agreeing to the judgment, said accused appealed therefrom; but the attorney appointed to defend him 
de oficio
, believing that there is no possible defense for him and that, furthermore, the penalty imposed upon him is mild, make no recommendation, thereby making it understood that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.


The Solicitor-General recommends that the aforesaid judgment be modified in the sense of imposing upon the appellant from one to the ten days of 
arresto menor 
and a fine not exceeding P500.


The penalty prescribed for the crime committed by the appellant, asking into consideration the mitigating circumstances of voluntary confession of guilt present therein, without any aggravating circumstances to offset it, is
 arresto menor 
in its minimum period and a fine of less than P200 (article 280; 51; 64, rule 2; and 71 of the Revised Penal Code, the latter as amended by section 3 of Commonwealth Act No. 217). In other words, the penalty which should be imposed upon the appellant is ten days of 
arresto menor
 should be imposed upon appellant is ten days of 
arresto menor
 and a fine of P150 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.


Modified as above-stated the appealed judgment is affirmed in all other respect, with costs to the appellant. So ordered.


Avanceña, C.J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Laurel and Concepcion, JJ., concur.
