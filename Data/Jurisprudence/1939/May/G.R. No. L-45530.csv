IMPERIAL, 
J.:


This is an appeal taken by the plaintiff from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered in the case, dismissing the complaint, with costs.


The plaintiff, which is a corporation organized under existing laws and engaged in the bond business, commenced the action against the defendants to recover the premiums on the counterbond which they executed, corresponding to the period from April 2, 1935 until April 2, 1937, amounting to P480, plus stipulated interest at 12 per cent per annum. The defendants did not deny the existence and authenticity of the counterbond signed by them, but alleged as special defense that the bond executed by the plaintiff, which in this case was the obligation guaranteed by the counterbond, had ceased to exist as it has been cancelled before the date the premiums became due. The case was tried and decided upon the following:

The plaintiff attributes to the appealed decision the following errors: (1) in holding that the mere execution and filing of the new bound by the defendant Y. Chong discharged the plaintiff from further liability arising from the bond which he signed, which resulted in the loss of its right to collect the premiums claimed; (2) in not holding that, the bond put up by the plaintiff having been cancelled by the Bureau of Commerce and Industry on June 19, 1936, only, the defendants, under the express terms of the counterbond filed by them, are under a duty to pay the premiums corresponding to the two years mentioned in the complaint; (3) in not holding that the delay in the cancellation of the bond filed by the plaintiff was due to the negligence of the defendant Y. Chong, consisting in his non-compliance with the rules adopted by the Bureau Commerce and Industry regarding the cancellation of bonds, and (4) in not granting the motion for new trial of the plaintiff and in not rendering judgment in its favor.


The only legal question that calls for answer in this appeal is whether, under the terms of the counterbond, Exhibit A, and the stipulated and admitted facts, the defendants are bound to pay to the plaintiff the premiums claimed by the latter on the bond which it, in turn, signed in favor of the Government of the Philippines to guarantee faithful performance by Y. Chong of the provisions and conditions imposed by the Bonded Warehouse Act, No, 3893. The trial court answered the question in the negative and adversely to the plaintiff, being of the opinion, upon an interpretation of the contracts, that the counterbond had expired since February 2, 1935, the date when the new bond, executed on the 1st of the same month by the Visayan Surety & Insurance Corporation, was filed by Y. Chong with the branch office of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry in Iloilo. This conclusion is plainly erroneous because under its terms the counterbond did not expire one year after its execution, but was in full force and effect during all the time that the bond executed by the plaintiff in favor of the Government for the sum of P12,000, Exhibit B, was in force. In other words, the counterbond was valid and subsisting until the bond was cancelled by the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, in Manila, and the cancellation took place on January 19, 1936 only (Exhibit V-2). In weighing the facts and in applying the law, there was evidently a confusion of ideas, the period of one year for the payment of premiums having been mistaken for the period or duration of the counterbond. The premiums were collected for one year in advance, but the counterbond had been executed to be in force until the cancellation of the bond which, in turn, had no fixed period but may be cancelled at any time at the discretion of the Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry.


Another consideration taken into account in dismissing the action is that, from the filing of the new bond, Exhibit 1, the plaintiff already ceased to run any risk, hence, its right to collect premiums also ceased from that time. This is not correct. The plaintiff could have been compelled to pay the amount of its bond if the conditions thereof had been infringed during all the time that it was in force of while it had not been cancelled. Under the terms of the bond the plaintiff was bound to pay the P12,000 should its conditions be violated while it had not been cancelled by the Bureau of Commerce and Industry.


The correctness of the amount of the premiums due and claimed is not open to question as the defendants bound to pay them for every year that has expired or fraction thereof.


The foregoing impliedly resolves the second assignment of error, and as to the third, we agree that one of the reasons why the plaintiff's bond was not immediately cancelled was the omission by the defendant Y. Chong to file the affidavit of cancellation required by the rules adopted by the Bureau of Commerce and Industry.


The plaintiff also claims P50 for attorney's fees. We are unwilling to award this penalty because it is not clearly stipulated in the counterbond. On the other hand, the bond filed was not executed but cancelled, and from what appears of record, there was no need for litigation to obtain the cancellation.


In view of the foregoing, the appealed judgment is reversed, and the defendants are ordered to pay to the plaintiff, jointly and severally, the sum of P480, with interest at 12 per cent per annum on one-half thereof from April 2, 1935, and on the other-half from April 2, 1936, plus costs in this instance. So ordered.
