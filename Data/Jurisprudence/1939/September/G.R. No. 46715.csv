 defendants-appellants.


Isidro L. Vejunco for appellants.

DIAZ, 
J.:


The question raised before us by the appeal taken by the accused from the judgment of the lower court, sentencing them for 
estafa
 to suffer the principal penalty of three months of 
arresto mayor
 and an additional penalty of ten years and one day of
 prision mayor
 by reason of habitual delinquency, besides indemnifying Toribia Bacos in the sum of P43.80, is whether or not said two penalties are in accordance with law.


The information charging the appellants with the crime in question, of which it may be truthfully stated that they pleaded guilty upon arraignment, reads as follows:




That on or about December 15, 1938, in the municipality of Pasay, Province of Rizal, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused abovenamed, conspiring together and helping each other, by means of false and fraudulent manifestations which they made to Toribia Bacos to the effect that a solitaire ring which was in their possession was genuine and valued at P900 and knowing fully well that such manifestation was false and fraudulent, because said ring was fake with copper setting and false diamond, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously induce said Toribia Bacos to exchange and deliver and in fact she exchanged and delivered a pair of earrings, worth P8, a ring worth P4, and an engagement ring worth P1, a gold necklace worth P30 and cash of P0.80 for the said fake solitaire ring, and once in possession of said jewelries and money belonging to Toribia Bacos, the accused above-named, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, appropriate and convert said jewelries and money to their own use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of the said owner in the amount of P43.80.




That the accused Emilio de Jesus and Francisco de la Rosa are habitual delinquent, having committed the present crime within the period of 10 years from their last release from prison on December 28, 1938, and October 30, 1938, respectively, and having been convicted of 
estafa
 and competent courts within the same period of 10 years, as follows:
