Upon cross examination, witness Evangelista stated that it was at around seven o'clock in the evening of June 12, 1964 when he went to the Magallanes Plaza at Masbate, Masbate; that the stabbing incident took place at around 1 o'clock in the morning (obviously referring to June 13, 1964); that he was at the gate when the incident took place and there were many people; that Sgt. Juan Desilos was guarding the Magallanes Gate because people were rushing towards it. When asked whether he also then wanted to enter the gate, he answered that he was there inside, about a distance of one meter from the gate, and when asked once more, he affirmed his answer (pp. 82-87, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Witness Dr. Orlando delos Santos, then 35 years old, married and a resident physician of Masbate Provincial Hospital at Masbate, Masbate, told the court that on or about midnight of June 12, 1964, he was on duty in the hospital when the dead body of Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. of the Philippine Constabulary was brought in. According to him the probable cause of death was cardiac hemorrhage; and that the stab wound at the mid-epigastric region, penetrating the abdominal cavity and perforating the cardiac region was caused by a sharp blunt instrument and that the injury directly caused the death of Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. He opined that the knife Exhibit ""A"" could have caused the wound on the body of Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. and he Identified Exhibit ""B"" as the uniform of Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. and Exhibit ""B-1"" as the cut on the front right side of said uniform. He further Identified Exhibit ""C"", the death certificate he issued, and Exhibit ""C-1"", his signature thereon (pp. 58-65, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


When cross-examined, witness admitted that it was his first time to see the knife Exhibit ""A"" and that he did not examine the same as it was not brought to the hospital for chemical examination. He opined that Exhibit ""A"" is stained with blood but he cannot distinguish whether it is human blood or animal blood (pp. 65-67, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Questioned by the Court, he ventured the opinion that the stain in the uniform of Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. could be the blood that came from the wound inflicted on him. He further declared that he probed the wound of Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. with an instrument to find out the extent of the entrance and penetration of the wound and found that the wound was midway umbilicus, the point of entrance of the stab wound was one-half inch to the right, which is at the epigastric region; and that the wound was directed a little upward and in a lateral way, about 7 to 8 inches deep. He was certain that the cause of death was the stab wound which was caused by a sharp pointed instrument (pp. 67-69, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Technical Sergeant Modesto Taleon, assigned as investigator and platoon sergeant of the 60th PC Company, Masbate, Masbate, testified that he has been connected with the Philippine Constabulary since May 27, 1941; that he knew Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. who was one of their platoon sergeants and who relieved him as security on June 12, 1964 at the Magallanes Gate, where there was then a coronation dance. Their designation as security in charge was in writing; marked as Exhibit ""D"", signed by their Commanding Officer, Capt. Eugenio. In said Exhibit ""D"", the name of Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. appears, with seven enlisted men, whose time of duty started as therein specified at 1900 hours. On the night of June 12, 1964, he was at the Magallanes Gate and Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr., who was in uniform and with a sidearm, was also there as he was performing security duties at the coronation dance and maintaining peace and order thereat. When he (witness) was near the stage and while looking at the crooner he saw Chief Salvacion take the microphone from the singer and call for a doctor as the soldier assigned at the Magallanes Gate had been stabbed. When he heard the announcement, he immediately rushed to the scene of the crime and found that there were already many men in uniform at the scene, and Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. was no longer there as he had already been brought to the Masbate Provincial Hospital. So he, together with his commanding officer, investigated the incident and they were able to recover the fatal weapon which was then dripping with blood; he Identified said weapon in open court, which was marked as Exhibit ""A"" and the blood stains thereon as Exhibit ""A-1 "". He found the knife, Exhibit ""A "", on the road facing the Magallanes Gate around five meters away from the scene of the crime, wrapped it and presented it to the commanding officer for safekeeping. Then they proceeded to the Masbate Provincial Hospital where they saw Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. in the operating room already dead; Sgt. Desilos uniform which was already removed, was stained with blood with a cut at the last button of the uniform (Exh. ""B-1 "") which appeared to have been pierced by a blunt instrument and coincided with the wound of the deceased, Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. The uniform, including the pants, Exhibit ""B"", was full of blood. He Identified the patch on the uniform as that of the P.C. (Exh. ""B-2"" and the chevron of a staff sergeant (pp. 87105, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


The cross-examination elicited from witness the fact that he studied criminal investigation and he specialized on the subject as he was sent in 1958 by the Government to Camp Crame to take up criminal investigation and he likewise trained in 1963 in a seminar held in Cebu. He applied what he had learned in his investigations at Masbate, including the investigation of this stabbing incident. He affirmed that he, together with two companions, recovered the fatal knife. Exhibit ""A"", on the road five meters away from the scene of the crime but outside of the area cordoned off by the PC and admitted that he did not actually measure the distance but merely calculated it; although he advanced the opinion that where an incident took place in a crowded place, a trained investigator gets the actual distance. According to him, the place of the incident was cordoned off or surrounded by soldiers who did not tamper with anything thereat. As other people and peace officers arrived ahead of him at the scene of the incident, he did not know the investigating officer who arrived first. When they found the knife, he just grabbed it and presented it to his commanding officer, because he already knew that it was the fatal knife as it was then dripping with blood and lying flat on the ground. But when he picked it up, it was no longer dripping with blood but it was wet with blood. The route where the blood came from and where the knife was found was marked with blood stains. He admitted that per investigation procedure, important evidence like Exhibit ""A"" should not be touched with the (bare) hands; but he explained and demonstrated that he handed Exhibit ""A"" with care, with his thumb in the inner blade, and his two fingers on the outer blade, near the foot of the wooden handle, without touching its blade. He revealed that after the said Exhibit ""A"" was presented to his commanding officer nothing more was done. Exhibit ""A"" was not sent to the PC laboratory to test its blood stains; neither was the same examined for fingerprints. In fact, the suspects were never fingerprinted. He just concluded that Exhibit ""A"" was the fatal weapon (pp. 106-118, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Judge Jose M. Angustia then 63 years old, married, municipal judge of Masbate, Masbate, resident of Masbate, Masbate, declared that he knew Rodolfo Regala, alias Rudy Regala, as he was brought several times before his court as accused in cases involving peace and order. Lately, he convicted him of the crime of malicious mischief. He could not recall having convicted him of the crime of physical injuries; but he Identified Exhibit ""E"" as the original duplicate copy of a decision in criminal case No. 2794 of the Municipal Court of Masbate, convicting accused Rodolfo Regala of the crime of slight physical injuries and Exhibit ""E-1"" as his signature affixed thereon (pp. 123-127, t.s.n. Vol. III, rec.). 


Immediately after aforesaid witness had testified, counsel for accused moved to strike out the testimony on the ground that the same is impertinent and immaterial but said motion was denied as without merit by the court (pp. 128-131, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Thereafter, counsel for accused asked the court for the recall of prosecution witness Juanito Evangelista for further cross-examination on the ground that there were vital matters overlooked by said defense counsel who earlier, in obedience to the order of the court, had to enter trial without having first consulted the accused. The prosecuting fiscal objected on the ground that prosecution witness Juanito Evangelista who had earlier informed him of his fears of reprisal, was not in the courtroom. Defense counsel, in insisting on the recall of said witness, informed the court that it has come to his knowledge that ""... the first suspect of the PC was Evangelists. His clothes were found with blood stains as well as his hands ..."" Nevertheless, the court denied the motion to recall but advised defense counsel to establish that fact as a defense of the accused (pp. 131-135, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


After the evidence for the prosecution was admitted by the court, defense counsel moved, by way of demurrer, for the dismissal of the case on the grounds that the prosecution miserably failed to establish the guilt of accused Delfin Flores and second, that there was variance between the date of the commission of the crime as alleged in the information and that proved by the evidence (pp. 138-151, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


The prosecuting fiscal interposed his objection on the main ground that the alleged variance was not substantial as the events leading to the stabbing incident began in the late hour of June 12, 1964 culminating at around midnight or immediately thereafter. Hence, the information alleged the time of the crime as ""... on or about the 13th of June, 1964 ..."" (pp. 151-162, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Defense counsel prayed for time to file his memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss and he was granted by the court up to August 21, 1964 to file the same and the provincial fiscal was required to reply thereto up to August 29, 1964 (p. 166, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


On August 14, 1964, defense counsel filed his memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss and prayed for the dismissal of the case against both accused (pp. 34-44, Vol. II, rec.), and thereafter or on August 25, 1964, he filed a supplementary Page memorandum (pp. 45-54, Vol. II, rec.). 


On August 25, 1964, without waiting for the reply memorandum of the prosecuting fiscal, winch was filed only on September 7, 1964 (pp. 59-60, Vol. II, rec.), the trial court denied the motion to dismiss (pp. 55-58, Vol. II, rec.). 


Consequently, the case was set for the reception of the evidence of the defense. Eight witnesses were presented by the defense, including accused Rudy Regala and Delfin Flores. Three of these witnesses — Alberto Abayon, Eladio Mendoza and Noemi Almirol — claimed to have been at the scene of the crime and seen the stabbing of Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr.. 


Alberto Abayon, then 19 years old, single, and a student of Osmeña College, Masbate, testified that on June 12, 1964, he was at the Magallanes Gate, arriving thereat at about 9:30 o'clock in the evening, together with Shirley Letada Rogelio Ora-a and Violets Sorsogon. They could not immediately enter the auditorium because of so many people crowding the place. They were able to enter at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening. He was not aware whether there were movie actresses inside. He stayed in the plaza for a long time and went home at around 12:30 in the morning (June 13, 1964), with Noemi Almirol. Upon reaching Magallanes Gate on his way home, he saw a person whom he did not know, stab Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr.. He was then behind Sgt. Desilos Jr. and around one meter away from him. He saw blood dripping from Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr.'s abdomen. His companion, Noemi Almirol who was then at his left side, fainted upon seeing the blood flowing from Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr.. Then he heard Sgt. Desilos say ""Noy please accompany me but he does not know the person requested by Sgt. Desilos Jr.. Witness described the man who stabbed Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. as tall, with long hair, quite black in complexion and wearing a short-sleeved polo shirt with red stripes (pp. 168-170, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


He saw Rudy Regala at around 12:20 in the morning (June 13, 1964) drinking beer with companions inside the canteen at the Magallanes Gate, a place beside the Liceo School. He does not know the companions of Rudy Regala. Said accused was at that time wearing a white polo shirt. Shortly thereafter, he (witness) left for home at which time Rudy Regala was standing inside the canteen (p. 171, t.s.n., Vol. III. rec.). 


After Noemi Almirol had recovered, he brought her home alone and as they passed by the gate, Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. was no longer there (p. 172, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Claiming that he is familiar with Magallanes Gate, witness affirmed that it is enclosed with concrete walls on its sides except at its back which is enclosed with wire. Its side facing Quezon street is walled with hollow blocks. According to him, if one were inside the Plaza Magallanes and looked towards Quezon street, he would not be able to see the persons outside who are facing the wall; and if one were outside at Quezon street and looked towards the plaza, he would not be able to see the people inside (pp. 171-172, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


On cross-examination, witness disclosed that he went to the plaza that evening of June 12, 1964 to dance; that before he entered Osmeña College, he studied in Masbate High School but Rudy Regala was not one of his classmates there; that he did not report what he saw to and he was not interviewed by, the police, but the following morning, he was interviewed by a PC man whom he did not know and they had an exchange of opinions and he was asked by the PC man whether he knew the man who stabbed Sgt. Desilos and he answered that he did not. He affirmed and he was sure that he saw Rudy Regala drinking in the canteen inside the Magallanes Gate and that said canteen is far from the Magallanes Gate but he could not calculate the distance; and that Sgt. Desilos was stabbed right at the gate marked as EXIT of Magallanes Gate at which precise moment he was a meter behind Sgt. Desilos He saw Rudy Regala at about 12:20 in the morning and this was before the stabbing incident. He does not know whether the gate was closed at the time of the stabbing incident but knew for a fact that there were many persons milling around the gate marked EXIT. He did not see the fatal weapon used by the culprit (pp. 172-174, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


In re-direct, he affirmed that he was a meter behind Sgt. Desilos when the latter was stabbed and Noemi Almirol was beside him and there were many people outside (p. 174, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Questioned by the Court, he revealed that Noemi Almirol is a young girl; that he brought her alone to her home at 12:30 in the morning, that he does not know her age; that he had known her for a long time as they were once neighbors;, that the residence of Noemi Almirol is at Quezon Street, far from Magallanes Gate, somewhere near the Medinas, in front of the residence of Dr. Sta. Cruz; that he is 16 years old but does not know who is older between him and Noemi Almirol; that Noemi Almirol is a third year high school student at Masbate High School; that he is a high school graduate as of June 13, 1964; and that he did not use to go out with Noemi Almirol and he had not gone to her house (pp. 174-175, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Noemi Almirol, then 18 years old, single, a resident of Masbate, Masbate and a student of Masbate High School, testified that on June 12, 1964, she was at the Plaza Magallanes Gate, arriving there at 10:00 o'clock in the evening, with Amparo de Paz, Luningning Bonan and Elena Esparaguerra They were able to enter the plaza immediately and stayed thereat up to 12:00 o'clock midnight. At about 12:00 o'clock midnight, she met Alberto Abayon and they went home together at around 2:00 o'clock the following morning of June 13, 1964; that at the gate of Plaza Magallanes, she observed something unusual which was the killing of a PC soldier, and she fainted when she saw blood flowing from the body of Sgt. Desilos who was about one meter from her. She has known accused Rudy Regala for a long time and before she fainted she did not see Rudy Regala at the place where the PC man was bleeding (pp. 186-187, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Cross-examined, she affirmed that in going home, she was with Alberto Abayon and it was then about 2:00 o'clock in the morning of June 13, 1964, although she is not sure of the time; and that she was behind the victim who was about a meter away from her. She did not know what happened after she fainted nor did she hear the announcement made by Police Chief Salvacion about the stabbing incident. She further declared that Rudy Regala was not her classmate at Masbate High School; nor did she ever see him there as she had just transferred to that school. She did not know that Rudy Regala was also studying in the Masbate High School (pp. 188-189, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.). 


Upon redirect examination, she revealed that she had a time piece on that night of the incident but she did not check it before leaving for home (p. 189, t.s.n., Vol. III, rec.)

Desilos that he only came to know the victim as Sgt. Desilos in the morning of June 13, 1964; that he was charged with concealment of a deadly weapon by the police force of Masbate; and that he pleaded guilty to the charge and was consequently sentenced to two months' imprisonment which he had served out already (pp. 45-60, t.s.n., Vol. IV, rec.). 


On re-direct he revealed that in the criminal case of People versus Delfin Flores for the murder of Cuyos, he pleaded guilty to the crime charged, and affirmed that in the case of illegal possession of deadly weapon, he also pleaded guilty (pp. 60-61, t.s.n., Vol. IV, rec.). 


By way of rebuttal evidence, prosecution presented witnesses Felixberto Laguerta and Gerardo Gotis. 


Felixberto Laguerta who was then 43 years old, married, and a policeman of Masbate, Masbate, testified that the testimony of Rudy Regala that the Black Jack organization is a club and not a gang, is not true because it is called the Black Jack gang; that he knows that it is a gang and not a club because the members have tattoos on their shoulders; that it is also not true that Pedro Verga Eladio Mendoza, Rudy Espinas, Romeo Floresta and Alberto Abayon are not members of the Black Jack gang; that all of them were arrested for being members of the said gang; that it is also not true as testified by Rudy Regala that he was not arrested by him at the cockpit when he (Rudy) was about to stab PC Formalejo for the truth was that on December 22, 1963 he arrested him and confiscated from him a knife; that Exhibit ""F"" is the same knife he confiscated from Rudy Regala, but no case was filed against Rudy Regala in connection therewith because Formalejo refused to file a complaint against Regala (pp, 6367, t.s.n., Vol. IV, rec.). 


Cross-examined, he testified that he has been a policeman for 19 years; that he was told by Fiscal Butalid to testify in this case that he did not execute any affidavit in connection with his arrest of Rudy Regala and confiscation from him of a knife, Exhibit ""F""; that he reported the matter to the chief of police of Masbate, Masbate, Chief Salvacion; that he does not know whether the arrest and confiscation were recorded in the police blotter as it was the police sergeant who was in charge of recording the same; that the basis of his testimony that Rudy Espinas, Pedro Verga Romeo Floresta are members of the Black Jack gang is the tattoo on their shoulders which is in the form of cards and that all of them were arrested by reason of the fact that they are all members of said gang; that membership in the Black Jack gang is a crime; that because they are members of a gang, he suspected them of doing something bad; and that they were arrested because they were doing something wrong in the poblacion (pp. 68-72, t.s.n., Vol. IV, rec.). 


Cross-examined by the trial judge, witness confirmed that Rudy Regala is a relative of a very high ranking municipal official of the town of Masbate, Masbate, as the mother of Rudy Regala is the cousin of the town mayor-Mayor Magallanes. However, he does not know whether it was by reason of this relationship that Rudy Regala's father and mother are living inside the market site of Masbate, Masbate. He further revealed that he delivered the knife ""Exhibit ""F"" to Chief Salvacion but no action was taken by Chief Salvacion against Rudy Regala in connection therewith (pp. 72- 73, t.s.n., Vol. IV, rec.). 


The other rebuttal witness, Gerardo Gotis, then 47 years old, married, and sergeant of the PC at Masbate, Masbate, testified that Rudy Regala's assertion on the witness stand that he was maltreated at the PC barracks was a he as Rudy Regala was never maltreated; that when he arrested Rudy Regala on June 13, 1964 at the market place, he was able to confiscate from Mm a knife (identified as Exh. ""G"") [pp. 74-76, t.s.n., Vol. IV, rec.]. 


Cross-examined by defense counsel, he affirmed that he got the knife, Exhibit ""G"" from Rudy Regala last June 13, 1964; that he did not file any case against Rudy Regala in connection with Exhibit ""G"" as he merely indorsed the same to the 1st PC sergeant and because his commanding officer, Capt. Eugenio ordered him not to file any case as there was already a case against Rudy Regala. However, he retracted his testimony that the non-filing of the case was the order of Capt. Eugenio. The reason for the non-filing was because it was merely overlooked as they were then busy investigating suspects in this murder case (pp. 76-78, t.s.n., Vol. IV, rec.). 


The trial Judge gave more weight and credence to the testimonies of the witnesses of the People than that of the accused, resulting thus, as aforestated, in the conviction of accused Rudy Regala for the complex crime of murder with assault upon an agent of a person in authority, and the imposition on him of the supreme penalty of death. However, with respect to the other accused, Delfin Flores, the trial Judge found him guilty only as an accessory after the fact. Consequently, the trial Judge imposed upon accused Delfin Flores the penalty of eight months and 21 days as minimum, to six years and 1 day of 
prision mayor
 as maximum with the recommendation that his parole be immediately cancelled. 


Before Us therefore by way of review is only the death penalty imposed on accused Rudy Regala; because Delfin Flores did not interpose any appeal from his conviction as an accessory after the fact, and was accordingly released on June 11, 1973 after the expiration of his sentence as certified by the Director of the NBP (p. 198, Vol. I, rec.). 


Counsel 
de officio
 contends that the trial court erred in failing to give the two accused a fair trial; in holding Rudy Regala responsible for the killing of Juan Desilos Jr.; in convicting Rudy Regala, assuming 
arguendo
 that he was the man who stabbed the victim, of the crime of murder with assault upon an agent of a person of authority; and in holding Delfin Flores, under the alleged facts of the case, liable as accessory after the fact of the crime of murder with assault against an agent of a person in authority. 


I


Counsel 
de officio
 claims in support of the first assigned error that the indignation and revulsion of the trial Judge at the commission of the monstrous crime herein involved as can be gleaned from the decision under review, thus: 






Murder as a crime is indeed heinous. But when the crime had to be committed in a public place, where people were enjoying the spirit of the fiesta, and amidst the sound of the drums and the trumpets and the tantalizing sweetness of the dance music, the deviltry of the perpetrator is compounded. The perversity of the perpetrator is even made more ugly and ugliest indeed because the victim was in the uniform of an agent of the law and was performing his duty as he saw fit. He was there foregoing the pleasure of the evening so that others may enjoy. He was there as a symbol of authority so that peace may be maintained for those many who love peace and tranquility. He was there, distant from his home, his wife and his children who would want him near them during those happy and festive moments in answer to the call of duty, only to be treacherously killed by an assassin with the blackest soul. He died almost in the spot where duty demanded of him. He died so that others may enjoy and live. His was a fruitful life with a duty well done and his was a heroic death. He died in the altar of public service and his was a death of a hero. The Court would be recreant of its duty if it should fail to notice this splendid performance of a lowly but loyal public servant (p. 44, Vol. I, rec.). 






directly caused undue prejudice against the accused because of his previous criminal record as manifested by the following portions of the decision of the trial Judge — 






Who is Rudy Regala? He is a convict, although in the crime of slight physical injuries. According to Municipal Judge Jose Angustia. of Masbate, he has been brought very often to his Court for several mischiefs he has committed. And who is Delfin Flores? He is a convicted murderer and a parolee. Birds of the same feather, flock together (p. 32, Vol. I, rec.). 


Is there a possibility that Rudy Regala could perpetrate the crime in company of Delfin Flores, a parolee, moments before midnight and/or moments after midnight? The distance of the canteen from the exit gate is not considerable. Rudy Regala could have been at the canteen early that evening and could have gone out with Delfin Flores and then returned at the exit door, committed the crime and then returned to the canteen to prepare for his alibi? This may be conjectural, but the possibility would not be farfetched. To a man with criminal mind and criminal tendencies, anything could be possible (p. 25, Vol. I, rec.). 


... So that after the incident, he could have disappeared among the crowd and he and Rudy Regala could have returned inside in order to establish an alibi. It should be remembered that Delfin Flores and Rudy Regala are convicts and are dangerously mischievous. Although it may be argued that criminals would not at times return to the scene of their adventures, nevertheless, there are those who, to prepare an alibi, would do so, accustomed as they have been in committing acts of deviltry Is this possible and/or probable? 


While witnesses of the defense, because of their ages, their being acquaintances close and tight, have every reason to help their friend Rudy Regala in his terrible predicament, Rudy Regala, a member of an organization with tatoos on their right arm, could have certain moral ascendancy over Abayon, Mendoza and Florista and even with Noemi Almirol, that in the spirit of friendship they are coming to the rescue of criminal friend Rudy Regala (pp. 25-26, Vol. I, rec.). 


The defense of the accused is alibi. Rudy Regala claimed that he was inside the canteen, which was a few members from the exit door of the Magallanes auditorium on the night Sgt. Desilos was stabbed. Rudy Regala is a convict and a notorious young man and the Court will take the same into account (p. 29, Vol. I, rec.). 






In essence, therefore, counsel 
de officio's
 first assigned error boils down to the delicate question of whether appellant Rudy Regala was denied due process of law. It must be emphasized that the jurisprudence under the 1935 Constitution treated the right of an accused to impartial trial as an aspect of the guarantee of due process. Under the present Constitution, that right to impartial trial is now expressly declared as one of the cardinal rights of an accused. Thus its Section 19, Article IV (Bill of Rights), provides that ""(I)n all criminal prosecutions, the accused ... shall enjoy the right ... to have a speedy, 
impartial 
and public 
trial
 ..."" (emphasis supplied). WE have declared that ""... It is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution that no one is to be deprived of his liberty without due process of law. Moreover, there is a specific reference to its indispensability in a criminal prosecution. Thus is emphasized its importance for an accused. He can rely on the guarantee of fairness according to the fundamental law, which moreover provides additional safeguards at the stage of trial. Our Constitution does indeed go far in throwing the mantle of its protection on the one who is caught in the meshes of criminal law. The proceeding must neither be arbitrary nor unjust. It is to underscore the importance of a trial judge being detached and objective, free from bias either for or against the prosecution or for the person indicted. As was so aptly put by Justice Dizon: 'It has been said, in fact, that due process of law requires a hearing before an impartial and disinterested tribunal and that every litigant is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge ...' Earlier in People vs. Castañeda, Justice Laurel made clear the necessity for a 'trial before an impartial judge.' If it were otherwise, the pledge of due process becomes a myth. The trial is reduced to nothing but a useless formality, and Idle ceremony. If a judge had made up his mind to convict, even innocence would not suffice as a defense"" (People vs. Angcap, 43 SCRA 437, 441-442 [1972]). 


The thrust of appellant's posture is that the trial Judge, considering ""his fully justified indignation and revulsion at the commission of such a monstrous crime"" of murder, became prejudiced against appellant (as well as his co-defendant) after his previous criminal conviction was brought forth during the trial, to the extent that the trial Judge no longer gave due consideration to the evidence of the defense (pp. 73-78, Vol. I, rec.). 


On the other hand, the Solicitor General submits that the above argument of counsel de oficio does not properly fit the assigned error, because it assails the decision of the trial court and its appreciation of the evidence submitted therein rather than the conduct of the trial itself (pp. 607, Appellant's Brief, p. 184, Vol. I, rec.). 


An impartial trial necessarily requires an impartial judge to conduct the same. In other words, absent an impartial judge, there can be no fair and impartial trial. Appellant impugns the impartiality of the trial judge, who was allegedly prejudiced against the appellant. 


WE do not agree with counsel 
de officio
 that the trial court failed to accord appellant Rudy Regala a fair trial. Appellant has not pointed, and We have found none, to any part or stage of the trial betraying the trial Judge's hostility, bias and prejudice against the appellant after the prosecution had brought forth the fact of appellant's previous criminal conviction. As a matter of fact, appellant's previous conviction of the crimes of malicious mischief and slight physical injuries was testified to only by the witness last presented by the prosecution in its evidence in chief. And the trial Judge, contrary to the claim of the appellant, gave due consideration to his evidence as shown by the fact that in the decision of conviction, the trial Judge examined extensively the testimonies of all the eight witnesses for the defense. Consequently, while the quoted portions of the judgment of conviction are interspersed with statements and phrases which properly should not have been made as they may be wrongly interpreted as indicative of bias and prejudice, such aforestated statements and phrases in the judgment of conviction do not per se constitute evidence of bias and impartiality in the conduct of the trial by the trial Judge as to violate appellant's right to an impartial trial. WE view the trial Judge's aforequoted statements and phrases as merely an expression, in the very words of appellant's counsel 
de officio 
herself, of the Judge's "" ... fully justified indignation and revulsion at the commission of such a monstrous crime ..."" 


II


1.	The trial court correctly rejected appellant Regala's defense of alibi and denial. Indeed such defenses cannot prevail over the affirmative testimonies of Erlinda Tidon and Juanito Evangelista who positively Identified appellant Rudy Regala as the one who inflicted the single but fatal wound on the deceased Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. (People vs. Cabiling 74 SCRA 285 [1976]; People vs. Roxas, 73 SCRA 583, 591 [1976]. And the exit gate where the stabbing took place was just in the vicinity of — about 15 meters from — the canteen where appellant was allegedly drinking beer during the night of June 12 until the early morning of the 13th. Alibi, to be convincing must preclude any possibility that the accused could have been physically present at the place of the crime nor its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission (People vs. Roxas, 
supra
). 


While the crime took place at midnight or a little past thereafter, such circumstance does not vitiate witnesses' Identification of appellant Rudy Regala as the person who stabbed to death Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr.; because the place at that time was well lighted by reason of the affair being celebrated (pp. 16, 78, Vol. III, rec.). Furthermore, the two witnesses were close to the exact spot of the incident as witness Tidon was barely one-half meter from the victim (p. 14, Vol. III, rec.), while witness Evangelista was about a meter from the exit gate where the victim was stabbed (p. 84, Vol. III, rec.). Hence, the possibility of erroneous Identification is remote. Despite the fact that both witnesses before the stabbing incident did not know appellant by name, they both declared that they knew him by face or appearance (pp. 31, 81, Vol. III, rec.). 


Furthermore, appellant has not shown by evidence of any evil motive on the part of prosecution witnesses Tidon and Evangelista to testify in the manner they did. The absence of any such improper motive enhances the credibility of said witnesses (People vs. Roxas, 
supra
). 


2.	It is a recognized principle that on the matter of credibility of witnesses, the observation of the trial court must be accorded respect and great weight in view of its special opportunity to observe closely the demeanor of the individual witnesses. As a matter of fact, the trial court gave its observations on the witnesses' conduct and candor on the witness stand, thus: 






Because of the seriousness of the offense not only because of the challenge that the perpetrator has poised upon the community the people and all citizenry because of the brazen manner of its commission, which was made before several people and in the midst of the festive mood of the occasion but because of the grave penalty which the crime carries, the Court took special interest in the two witnesses for the prosecution. 
It was carefully observed by the Court that both witnesses were curt on their declaration they were straightforward in their reply and their voice carry the ring of sincerity and truth. Their manner of replying on
 (sic) the question of the prosecution 
were those (sic) of serene honest and truthful individuals,
 who wanted to impart clearly what they saw. 
Their answer to the cross examination were (sic) given with a clear and convincing manner
. They were men who sat on the witness stand merely to convey what they have seen and noticed then, without hesitation. 


The Court cannot help but be convinced of the trustworthiness of their revelation. Under the searching barrage of cross-examination, they were never ruffled but they withstood the fire with simple dignity, speaking with a voice full of candor and truth. That is the impression these two witnesses have created in the mind of the Court. 
The clearness and simplicity of their assertion and their direct and positive Identification of the accused
 Rodolfo Regala alias Rudy Regala and Delfin Flores 
have convinced this Court
 (emphasis supplied). 






Because the trial Judge had spoken on a matter, which he indisputedly is in a much better position to appreciate, this Court can do no less than to place its imprimature thereon. Indeed, it has been aptly observed that 






... the judge who tries a case in the court below has vastly superior advantages for the ascertainment of truth and the decision of falsehood over an appellate court sitting as a court of review. The appellate court can merely follow with the eye the cold words of the witness transcribed upon the record, knowing at the same time, from actual experience, that more or less of what the witness actually did say is always lost in the process of transcribing. But the main difficulty does not lie here. There is an inherent impossibility of determining with any degree of accuracy what credit is justly due to a witness from merely reading the words spoken by him, even if there were no doubt as to the Identity of the words. However artful a corrupt witness may be, there is generally, under the pressure of a skillfull cross-examination, something in his manner or bearing on the stand that betrays him, and thereby destroys the force of his testimony. Many of the real tests of truth by which the artful witness is exposed in the very nature of things cannot be transcribed upon the record, and hence they can never be considered by the appellate court. For this reason the rule is firmly established that where there is an irreconcilable conflict in the testimony, the appellate court will not reverse the judgment of the trial court, where the evidence of the successful party, when considered by itself, is clearly sufficient to sustain the verdict (several cases cited) or unless some conclusion established from the fact is inconsistent with the court findings or there is some inherent weakness in the evidence upon which the conclusion is based, or unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence which has been overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted, as where the trial court in the valuation of testimony misinterpreted a supposed inherent weakness thereof not arising from the behaviour of the witness on the stand ... (People vs. Alto, 26 SCRA 342, 365 [1968]). 






3.	 Consequently, the inconsistencies and incredibilities in the testimonies of the material witnesses of the prosecution as pointed out by the appellant are better left to the appreciation of the trial court, which has not found the same sufficient to destroy the probity of said witnesses. 


Appellant contends that prosecution witness Erlinda Tidon's testimony to the effect that appellant Rudy Regala and accused Delfin Flores ran away after appellant Rudy Regala had stabbed Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr., is improbable considering that, according to Tidon herself, the scene of the crime was crowded or overflowing with people and consequently one cannot move fast or run (pp. 15, 16, 43, Vol. III, rec.). Such inconsistency or improbability is more apparent than real. It may be true that under normal condition, that is, absent any unusual incident such as the killing of a peace officer, such assertion may be characterized as improbable. This is not so, however, in the instant case; because the commotion created by the stabbing incident enabled the culprits to easily disappear among the milling throng. 


Again, the testimony of Erlinda Tidon to the effect that no other unusual incident occurred after the stabbing incident may not be characterized as false; because witness Tidon may have treated the stabbing incident and the consequent commotion engendered by the same as one continuing incident, instead of treating them as two separate incidents. Hence, she answered that aside from the stabbing incident no other unusual incident took place. 


Moreover, We have noted in People vs. Resayaga (54 SCRA 350 [1973]) that it is a common phenomenon to find inconsistencies, even improbabilities, in the testimony of a witness, especially on minor details or collateral matters. That the accounts of witnesses regarding the same occurrence are contradictory on certain details is not unusual. There is no perfect or omniscient witness because there is no person with perfect faculties or senses or a perfect control of his emotions. An adroit cross- examiner may trap a witness into making statements contradicting his testimony on direct examination. By intensive cross- examination on points not anticipated by the witness and his lawyer, a witness may be misled or trapped into making Statements that do not dovetail with the testimonies of other witnesses on the same points. Yet, if it appears that the witness has not wilfully perverted the truth, as may be gleaned from the tenor of his testimony and as appreciated by the trial Judge from his demeanor and behaviour on the witness stand, his credibility on material points may be accepted. 


III


The killing of Sgt. Juan Desilor Jr., according to the trial court, was qualified as murder by the circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation and hence, appellant was convicted of the complex crime of 
murder with assault upon an agent of a person in authority. 


Neither treachery nor evident premeditation can be properly appreciated and considered in tills instance case so as to characterize the killing as murder. So appellant contends and the Solicitor General agrees. WE find the aforesaid common stand correct as the evidence supports the same. 


Treachery is never presumed; it must be proven as conclusively as the act itself. It must be shown that the accused employed ""... means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risks to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make. "" 


By prosecution's own evidence, appellant was enraged because the deceased (Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr.) pushed his companion Delfin Flores and admonished him not to get in through the exit gate, then pulled out his knife and stabbed the victim in the abdomen. Treachery cannot therefore be appreciated as the attack made by appellant Rudy Regala was merely an immediate retaliation for the pushing made by the deceased, which act placed him on his guard. Moreover, deceased Juan Desilos Jr. at the time had a sidearm (p. 97, Vol. III, rec.) and was free to defend himself with it. If appellant's design was to be safe from a possible defense that the victim might make, he could have disarmed the victim first before stabbing him. This he did not do. Certainly, these circumstances negate treachery. 


With respect to the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation, it is well-settled that the essence of premeditation is that the execution of the criminal act must be preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during the space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment. Consequently, it must be clearly established by evidence the time when the offender determined to commit the crime, and a sufficient interval of time between the determination and the execution of the crime to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act. Neither the record nor the appealed decision intimates the existence of the foregoing circumstances which are essential for a positive finding of evident premeditation. On the contrary, the circumstances of the case rule out premeditation. 


The principle enunciated in the Manalinde (14 Phil. 77 [1909]), Butag (38 Phil. 746 [1918]), Binayon (35 Phil. 23 [1916]) and Zalzos (40 Phil. 96 [1919]) to the effect that premeditation may exist even if there was no predetermined victim, does not apply in the instance case In all these cases it was sufficiently established that the accused deliberately planned to kill although without a definite person as intended victim. In the present case, there is no evidence pointing to the fact that appellant planned to kill any person who ma cross his path. His act of bringing with him a knife in going to the plaza is not an indication that he did plan to kill anybody. 


Consequently, the killing of Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr. by appellant cannot be qualified as murder. It was simple homicide. 


But the appellant cannot be convicted of the complex crime of homicide with assault upon an agent of a person in authority because the information filed against appellant did not allege the essential elements of assault that the accused then knew that, before or at the time of the assault, the victim was an agent of a person in authority. (People of the Philippines vs. Rodil, L-35156; Nov. 20, 1981; People vs. CFI of Quezon, Branch V, 68 SCRA 305, Nov. 28, 1975). The information in this case barely alleged that the accused ""... with deliberate intent to kill, with evident premeditation and treachery and taking advantage of nighttime, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack and stab with a knife (
cuchillo
) one Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr., a member of the Philippine Constabulary while he was then in the performance of his official duty thereby inflicting upon the latter serious stab wounds at the mid-epigastric region penetrating abdominal cavity and perforating cardial and cardiac region which injury directly caused his instantaneous death,"" which is similar to the information in the aforesaid 
Rodil
 case — ""appellant 'attack and stab PC Lt. Guillermo Masana while the latter was in the performance of his official duties, ..."" in which We ruled that ""[S]uch an allegation cannot be an adequate substitute for the essential averment to justify a conviction of the complex crime, which necessarily requires the imposition of the maximum period of the penalty prescribed for the graver offense ... "" 


Furthermore, as in the 
Rodil
 case, the subject information cannot be cured or validated by the doctrine enunciated in 
People vs. Balbar
 (21 SCRA 1119, Nov. 29, 1967), because unlike in the latter case, there are no allegations of facts from which it can be implied that the accused then knew that, before or at the time of the assault, the victim was an agent of a person in authority. 


Moreover, the fact that the crime of assault was established by the evidence of the prosecution without any objection on the part of the accused cannot likewise cure the aforestated defect in the information so as to validly convict the accused thereof; because to do so would be convicting the accused of a crime not properly alleged in the body of the information in violation of his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. 


As already stated, the crime of assault was definitely demonstrated by the evidence of the People because it showed that the victim (Sgt. Juan Desilos Jr.) while maintaining peace and order at the exit gate of the Plaza Magallanes where the crime took place, was in complete PC uniform at the time the accused attacked him by reason of the latter's act of pushing the accused and his co-accused so as to prevent them from entering the plaza through its exit gate. In the aforesaid Rodil case, it was stated that ""[L]ike a qualifying circumstance, such knowledge must be expressly and specifically averred in the information; otherwise, in the absence of such allegation, the required knowledge, like a qualifying circumstance, although proven, would only be appreciated as aggravating circumstance. Applying this principle, the attack on the victim, who was known to the appellant as a peace officer, could be considered only as aggravated by being 'in contempt or with insult to the public authorities' (par. 2, Art. XIV, Revised Penal Code) or as an insult or in disregard of the respect due the offended party on account of his rank ..."" (par. 3, Art. XIV, Revised Penal Code). 


Appellant can therefore be convicted only of the crime of homicide, aggravated by the circumstance of ""in contempt or with insult to the public authorities"" (par. 2, Art. XIV, Revised Penal Code), or as an ""insult or in disregard of the respect due to the offended party on account of his rank ..."" (par. 3, Revised Penal Code). 


WE stated in the 
Rodil
 case, thus: 






The term ""rank"" should be given its plain, ordinary meaning, and as suck refers to a high social position or standing as a grade in the armed forces (Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged, p. 1881); or to a graded official standing or social position or station (75 CJS 458); 


xxx			xxx			xxx


or to a grade or official standing, relative position in civil or social life, or in any scale of comparison, status, grade, including its grade, status or scale of comparison within a position (Vol. 36, Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition, p. 100). 


xxx			xxx			xxx


As explained by Mr. Justice Mariano Albert, then of the Court of Appeals, those ""generally considered of high station in life, on account of their rank (as well as age or sex), deserve to be respected. Therefore, whenever there is a difference in social condition between the offender and the offended party, this aggravating circumstance sometimes is present"" (Albert M.A.— The Revised Penal Code Annotated, 1946 Ed., p. 109). 


xxx			xxx			xxx


The aggravating circumstance of contempt of, or insult to, public authority under paragraph 2 of Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code can likewise be appreciated in the case at bar. 


xxx			xxx			xxx


While it is true that in the case of U.S. vs. Rodriguez, et al. (19 Phil. 150, 157-158), 
People vs. Siojo
 (61 Phil. 307, 317), and 
People vs. Verzo 
(21 SCRA 1403), this Court ruled that the term 
public authority
 refers to a person in authority and that a PC lieutenant or town chief of police is not a public authority but merely an agent of a person in authority; there is need of re-examining such a ruling since it is not justified by the employment of the term 
public authority
 in aforesaid paragraph 2 of Article 14 instead of the term 
person
 in authority which is specifically used in Articles 148 and 152 of the Revised Penal Code. There is no extended reasoning of the doctrine enunciated in the aforesaid three (3) cases why the phrase 
public authority
 should comprehend only persons in authority. The lawmaker could have easily utilized the term ""persons in authority"" in the aforesaid paragraph 2 of Article 14 in much the same way that it employed the said phrase in Articles 148 and 152. The lawmaker must have intended a different meaning for the term public authority, which may however include, but not limited to, persons in authority.


Under the decided cases, a municipal mayor barrio captain, barrio lieutenant or barangay captain is a person in authority or a public authority. Even a public school teacher is now considered a person in authority under CA 578 amending Article 152 of the Revised Penal Code (Sarcepudes vs. People, 90 Phil. 228). So is the town municipal health officer (People vs. Quebral, et al., 73 Phil. 640), as well as a nurse, a municipal councilor or an agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (People vs. Yosoya, CA-G.R. No. 8522-R, May 26, 1955; People vs. Reyes, et al., O.G.S. 11 p. 24). 


The chief of police should therefore be considered a public authority or a person in authority; for he is vested with jurisdiction or authority to maintain peace and order and is specifically duty bound to prosecute and to apprehend violators of the laws and municipal ordinances, more than the aforementioned officials who cannot prosecute and who are not even enjoined to arrest malefactors although specifically mentioned as persons in authority by the decided cases and by Article 152 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 1978 of June 22, 1957, The town chief of police heads and supervises the entire police force in the municipality as well as exercises his authority over the entire territory of the municipality, which is patently greater than and includes the school premises or the town clinic or barrio, to which small area the authority or jurisdiction of the teacher, nurse, or barrio lieutenant, respectively, is limited. 






Likewise, the guilt of appellant is aggravated by recidivism as he was previously sentenced by final judgment for slight physical injuries. 


WHEREFORE, APPELLANT RODOLFO REGALA ALIAS RUDY REGALA IS HEREBY FOUND GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF HOMICIDE AGGRAVATED BY RECIDIVISM AND BY CONTEMPT FOR OR INSULT TO A PUBLIC AUTHORITY OR DISREGARD OF THE RESPECT DUE THE OFFENDED PARTY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS RANK, WITHOUT ANY MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE, AND HE IS HEREBY SENTENCED TO SUFFER AN INDETERMINATE TERM OF IMPRISONMENT RANGING FROM TWELVE (12) YEARS OF
