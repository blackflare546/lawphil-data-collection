Solely on the basis of the above admissions and stipulations, the trial court rendered its Decision dismissing the complaint on the following ratiocination: 




And so from this the sole issue to be solved by this Court, is whether Defendant which furnished security guards to his Chamber of Commerce Building, wherein Plaintiff was one of the tenants, is subsidiarily liable for the civil liability imposed on one its security guard as it has been proven that he is insolvent. Plaintiff's action is based on Art, 103 RPC, which requires three requisites before such a subsidiary liability may arise: first, that the employer is engaged in a kind of industry: second, that the employee is insolvent and third, that the crime was committed by the employee in the discharge of ms duties. The first two requisites are present for the furnishing of security guards in engaging in some kind of industry, and the Stipulation of Facts shows that the security guard is insolvent. But was the crime committed while in the discharge of his duties? This Court does not think so. The duty of the security guard was to guard the premises assigned to him. The final decision finding the security guard guilty of robbery shows that in connivance with a 16-year old, gaining entrance through the opening left by the repair of the airconditioning unit, the robbers made away with office equipment owned by Plaintiff in the sum of P5,440.00. It is clear that this connivance was not in the discharge of his duties as security guard so that Defendant cannot be subsidiarily held liable for such an act. 


The complaint is, therefore, dismissed with costs against Plaintiff. 




SO ORDERED. 


The plaintiff's appeal to the Court of Appeals was certified by the said Court to the Supreme Court on the ground that the appeal involves pure questions of law. 


Plaintiff-appellant has assigned a single error in its brief to wit: 




THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE DEFENDANT'S EMPLOYEE WAS NOT IN THE DISCHARGE OF HIS DUTY WHEN HE COMMITTED THE CRIME AND THEREFORE THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYER COULD NOT BE HELD SUBSIDIARILY LIABLE. 




The trial court expressed the view that defendant-appellee may not be held liable for the loss of the office equipments of plaintiff-appellant inasmuch as the security guard was not acting in the discharge of his duties as such when the connived with Ernesto Secreto, who actually committed the robbery. The clear import of the trial court's ruling is that the subsidiary liability under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code may only arise if the employee commits the crime of which he was found guilty in line or in pursuance of the discharge of his assigned duties. 


Defendant-appellee agrees with the conclusion arrived at by the trial court but not on the ground expressed by it. Defendant-appellee denies liability under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code for the reason that the security guard in question was not assigned by defendant-appellee to guard the plaintiff-appellant's properties, his duty being to act as a security guard of the properties of the Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines. Defendant-appellee would admit that if the properties which were stolen belonged to the Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, defendant- appellee would be liable inasmuch as the unlawful taking occurred in the performance of discharge of the duties of the security guard. 


Plaintiff-appellant, on the other hand, maintains that the subsidiary liability of the eemployer under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code does not require that the employee commit the crime within the scope of his assigned tasks. Instead, it is enough if the employee committed the act while he was doing his assigned task as such employee, or on the occasion thereof, it being immaterial whether the act or crime committed is a part of the employee's duty or assigned task. Plaintiff-appellant cites the example given by recognized commentators on Criminal Law to illustrate his point, to wit: ""Where a workman of a construction company stole some things while he was making minor repairs in a house and after being prosecuted was found guilty and the workman cannot satisfy his own civil liability, under such a circumstance, the company is liable subsidiarily for the restitution of the things or for the payment of their value."" (Reyes and Revised Penal Code, 1960 edition, pp. 632-633; Albert, Commentaries on the Revised Penal Code, 1945 edition, p. 282.) It is argued that, as in the given example, the subsidiary liability of the employer may be imposed even if the crime committed was not in the discharge of the duties of the security guard, it not being a part of his duties to commit theft or robbery. 


We sustain the trial court's dismissal of the case. The law makes the employer subsidiarily liable for the civil liability arising from a crime committed by an employee ""in the discharge of his duties."" (Article 103, Revised Penal Code.) This subsidiary liability does not arise from any and all offenses that the employee may commit, but limited to those which he shall be found guilty of in the discharge of his duties. The law does not say, as urged by plaintiff-appellant, that the crime of the employee must be the one committed ""while in the discharge of his duties."" It could not be contemplated that an employer will be held responsible for any misdeed that his employee could have done while performing his assigned tasks. Thus, it is neither just nor logical that, if a security guard committed robbery in a neighboring establishment near the one he is assigned to guard, or raped a woman passerby in the course of his tour of duty, his employer should be made subsidiarily liable for his said misdeed. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the crime was committed by the employee ""in the discharge of his duties."" 


This conclusion is supported by the ruling in 
Marquez vs. Castillo
, 68 Phil. 568, wherein it was held that the subsidiary liability of the employer does not arise where the owner of the car which figured in an accident causing the death of one and injuries to another, the said accident not having occurred in the course of the performance of the duties for which the driver had been hired, it appearing therein that the driver took the car without the employer's knowledge and used it as if it were his own. 


In the case at bar, the security guard was assigned to guard the building, properties and installations of the Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines. (Paragraph 6, Stipulations of Facts.) The contract for security was between defendant-appellee and the Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines. (Paragraph 3, 
Ibid
.) No contract was ever entered by the plaintiff-appellant and defendant-appellee for security services of its office equipments and supplies which were never accounted for and placed under the control of defendant-appellee or any of the security guards assigned in the premises of the Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, (Paragraph 5, Ibid) In conniving with another to steal or rob the office equipments of plaintiff-appellant, the security guard in question may not be said have acted in the discharge of his duties as security guard. 'The circumstance that the office of plaintiff-appellant is in the same building for which defendant-appellee had a contract for security service does not materially change the legal implication of the said act. For all legal intents and purposes, the robbery could have been committed in a neighboring building or establishment, in which case, it may hardly be argued that the employer of the security guard should be made responsible for the cosnequences of such malefaction. 


Plaintiff-appellant may not derive decisive support for his contention from the example given by the commentaries on Criminal Law hereinabove-mentioned. It is not correct to say that the employer's subsidiary liability will be imposed even when the act is not done in pursuance of the duties of the employee, the act of stealing not being included in an employee's assigned tasks: nor would an employer ever include among the duties of his employee the commission of a crime. The act contemplated in Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code is necessarily a crime from which civil liability had arisen but which could not be satisfied by the accused employee. The statutory limitation that the crime of the employee must have been committed ""in the discharge of his duties"" is clearly intended to exclude crimes not related to the performance of the duties assigned to him by his employer. The crime in question pertains to this latter category. 


WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED, with costs against plaintiff-appellant. 


SO ORDERED.
