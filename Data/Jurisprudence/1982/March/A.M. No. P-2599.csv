Acting on the letter of Judge Alicia V. Sempio-Diy, Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Caloocan City, dated August 26, 1981, informing this Court that Mrs. Amelia G. Suarez, Cashier of the said court has not been filing her monthly report as cashier of the above-mentioned court and that the last report filed by her was for the month of December, 1980, with request that the Court's Financial Officer conduct an official audit on said cashier's account and records as soon as possible, as well as the report dated September 15, 1981 of Mr. Dimas H.

Supreme Court, Manila 


Sir: 


In compliance with your directive dated October 27, 1981, I am submitting herewith my COMMENT: I submit to the recommendation contained therein, however, I pray that the Supreme Court consider the fact that I am the sole support of my two (2) children as my husband is presently unemployed and separation from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits would further aggravate the pitiful economic plight in which we are in. 


I know that the Supreme Court renders justice with compassion and I appeal that the Supreme Court be compassionate enough to just transfer me to any other position where the handling of funds is not involved. 


I have realized my mistake. I have suffered for it. I have repented. 


						Very truly yours,










				(Sgd.) Amelia G. Suarez 














After mature deliberation, the Court resolved to DENY the request of respondent Suarez and to approve the recommendation of the Court Administrator of October 12, 1981 that ""respondent Amelia G. Suarez be found guilty of serious misconduct prejudicial to the public interest and that she be separated from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and pay, and payment of the whole amount.""
