vs.


EDUARDO GUTIERREZ alias EDUARDING and BERNABE MISLANG alias BERNING, 
defendants-appellants. 




ABAD SANTOS, 
J.:


This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Branch X, at San Carlos City, which reads as follows: 






WHEREFORE, the Court finds both accused, Eduardo Gutierrez @ Duarding and Bernabe Mislang @ Berning guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, without any aggravating or mitigating circumstance attending the commission of the crime, and hereby sentences each to the penalty of reclusion perpetua with the accessory penalties prescribed by law; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, Gerardo Estabillo in the sum of P12,000.00, and each to pay one-half of the cost.






The People's version of the facts is as follows: 






At about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of May 2, 1964, Barrio Captain Carlos Cagampan together with Rural Policeman Gerardo Estabillo, Domingo Cabaliw and Barrio Lieutenant Anastacio Ellorda were patrolling the barrio of Caturay, Bayambang, Pangasinan, because of the complaint of their barriomates that their carabaos and chickens were being stolen (pp. 3, 4, t.s.n., Dec. 8, 1966). During the course of their patrol the group saw two persons sitting on the side of the road (p. 2, t.s.n., Feb. 1, 1966). Domingo Cabaliw and Carlos Cagampan focused their flashlight at a distance of about six meters on the two sitting persons whom they recognized as the accused Eduardo Gutierrez and Bernabe Mislang and found each of them holding a carbine (pp. 5, 6, t.s.n., Dec. 8, 1966). At this juncture, the accused Eduardo Gutierrez shouted at Domingo Cabaliw, 'Cuya Doming, don't get near; if you will get near you will be in danger', to which Cabaliw answered: Duarding don't fire at us because we are on patrol this night' (pp. 5, 6, 7, t.s.n., Feb. 1, 1966). Immediately after Cabaliw uttered this remark, the accused Bernabe Mislang suddenly fired his carbine at the group, followed by accused Eduardo Gutierrez who also fired his carbine (p. 6, t.s.n., Dec. 8, 1966). Cagampan, Cabaliw and Ellorda at once ran for cover, but unfortunately their companion, Gerardo Estabillo, was hit and died instantly on the spot (pp. 7. 8, t.s.n., Id.). Thereafter, the two accused ran away (p. 14, t.s.n., Id.). 


At 4:00 o'clock in the morning of the following day, Domingo Cabaliw and Carlos Cagampan reported the killing to the Chief of Police of Bayambang who immediately dispatched two of his men to proceed to the scene of the crime and to arrest the suspects (pp. 3, 4, 5, t.s.n., May 3, 1967.) Upon arriving, thereat, Sgt. Tamondong, together with Patrolman Paningbatan and Dr. Amado Layug found the lifeless body of Gerardo Estabillo (pp. 6, 7, t.s.n., Id.). About twenty meters from the place where the victim fell and died, the police officers also found three empty shells fired from a carbine (p. 7, t.s.n., Id.; Exhs. ""E"", ""E-1 "", ""E-2""). After Dr. Amado Layug had examined the body of the deceased, it was brought to his house for autopsy and was later interred on May 5, 1964 in the Municipal Cemetery of Urbiztondo Pangasinan (pp. 8, 9, 15, t.s.n., Id.). (Appellee's brief, pp. 2-3.) 






Accordingly, Eduardo Gutierrez and Bernabe Mislang were charged of murder in an information which reads as follows: 






That on or about the 2nd day of May, 1964 at about 10:30 in the evening, barrio of Caturay, Bayambang, Pangasinan, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above-named accused with treachery and evident premeditation, with intent to kill, taking advantage of night time and with the use of firearms, did then and there criminally, unlawfully and feloniously shoot to death GERARDO ESTABILLO, a duly appointed Rural Policeman while in the performance of his official duty who was then on patrol duty in company with Barrio Captain, Carlos Cagampan thus inflicted gun shot wounds upon the person of GERARDO ESTABILLO which caused his instantaneous death 






The defense interposed by the two accused in the trial court was alibi which is also their defense on appeal. Their claim is stated in their brief as follows: 






The evidence for the defense are clear. The two accused had never been found to be hardened criminals or had been engaged in the commission of crimes during the past in their own place or anywhere. That in April 1964 and or prior thereto, the two accused left Caturay and went to Manila to look for a job. That they were able to land a job as truck helper in San Mateo, Rizal under Jose Vinluan and since they started working they never took their vacation in Caturay, Bayambang, Pangasinan except when they were informed that the authorities of Bayambang were looking for them due to their being suspected as the perpetrators of the killing of Gerardo Estabillo on the night of May 2, 1964. That both of them stated that on the night of May 2, 1964, or prior thereto, they never took their vacation in Caturay. They both slept in the house of Jose Vinluan at San Mateo, Rizal that night which is more that three hundred kilometers away from the scene of the incident. That they had no grudge against the deceased Gerardo Estabillo and there was no reason for them to kill him. That their presence in San Mateo, Rizal the whole day and night of May 2, 1964 and in the following day was confirmed by witness Jose Vinluan (p. 67, t.s.n., hearing of Dec. 8, 1968). This witness testified that on May 2, 1964 and up to 10:00 o'clock in the evening he was with the two accused Eduardo Gutierrez and Bernabe Mislang at San Mateo, Rizal, because they were his companions in delivering sand and gravel. It was therefore impossible for the two to reach Bayambang or their presence on the scene of the crime on the night of the killing of Gerardo Estabillo."" (Appellants' brief, pp. 14-16.) 






The defense of alibi must fail. The desideratum is the credibility of witnesses and on this point we have to leave untouched the finding of the trial court which, according to our examination of the record, has not overlooked a fact or circumstance which would have warranted our intervention. 


Eduardo Gutierrez and Bernabe Mislang were positively Identified as the perpetrators of the crime by Carlos Cagampan and Domingo Cabaliw. 


Carlos Cagampan testified that he was the barrio captain of Caturay, Bayambang, Pangasinan, that he knew Eduardo Gutierrez and Bernabe Mislang long before 1964 because the two were residents of barrio Caturay; and that he witnessed the killing of Gerardo Estabillo as follows:

Atty. ESTEVES:

(TSN, Feb. 1, 1966, pp. 5-8.) 


While it is true there are discrepancies in the statements of Cagampan and Cabaliw, the discrepancies are minor and may be attributed to the lapse of time between the event and the testimony as well as to the circumstance that the witnesses do not appear to have reached the level of education and sophistication which would make their testimony completely congruent. On the positive side, the discrepancies are indicative of credibility for completely congruent testimony is suspect considering that different persons obtain differing impressions. 


The trial court correctly found that there was no evident premeditation. There is nothing in the record to show that the two accused had planned the crime. Neither can it be said that there was treachery as found by the trial court. There was treachery, it is said, because the attack on the patrol was sudden and without warning. But the People's version of the facts shows that Eduardo Gutierrez shouted to Domingo Cabaliw, ""Cuya Doming, don't get near; if you will get near you will be in danger 


In view of the foregoing, it is Our opinion that the crime which was committed at the spur of the moment was the complex crime of homicide with direct assault against an agent of a person in authority considering that the deceased Gerardo Estabillo was a barrio rural policeman, Hence, the penalty for homicide, the more serious offense, should be imposed in its maximum period. (Art. 48, Revised Penal Code.) 


WHEREFORE, the judgment of the court a quo is hereby modified in that the appellants are hereby found guilty of the complex crime of homicide with direct assault and each of them is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of seven (7) years of 
prision mayor 
as minimum to seventeen (17) years and six (6) months of 
reclusion temporal
 as maximum; and the indemnity of P12,000.00 shall be paid by them jointly and severally to the heirs of the deceased. No costs. 


SO ORDERED. 


Barredo (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., De Castro, Ericta and Escolin JJ., concur. 


 


 


Separate Opinions


 


AQUINO, 
J., 
dissenting:


I concur but in my opinion the imposable indeterminate penalty should consist of a minimum taken from 
reclusion temporal
 medium and a maximum taken from 
reclusion temporal
 maximum, following People vs. Lawas, 97 Phil. 975; People vs. Gayrama, 60 Phil. 796 and People vs. Catacutan, 64 Phil. 107, 111. 


Hence, the accused may be sentenced to seventeen years of
 reclusion temporal 
medium as minimum to twenty years of 
reclusion temporal
 as maximum. 


In the majority opinion, the procedure for graduating the penalty for the complex crime, laid down in People vs. Gonzales, 73 Phil. 549, was the one followed. 


I disagree with the ruling in the Gonzalez case. The correct ruling is that announced in the Gayrama case and in People vs. Co Pao 58 Phil. 545.
