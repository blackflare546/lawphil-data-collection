To prevent the foreclosure, Yamamoto and/or Marilyn Javier, acting as officers of the corporation, made an agreement with Cheng Yong, one of the defendants in the aforementioned Civil Case.

Yamamoto and Javier then went to the Securities and Exchange Commission and filed a complaint, alleging that the controversy between Cheng Yong and Philippine Pacific was intra-corporate. (SEC Case No. 002042). The SEC restrained the foreclosure proceedings and thereafter, the parties finally agreed to the formation of a Management Committee, with powers among others, 'to take custody and possession of all assets, funds, properties and records of the corporation; and 'to administer, manage and preserve such assets, funds and records.

Manila, Philippines, October 26, 1981. (Page 22, Record)






The orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission referred to in the above order are as follows:






ORDER






After a careful study and review of the allegations of the separate motions filed by the respondents, both seeking to reconsider the Order of this Commission dated June 17, 1981 denying the motion to dismiss and the opposition of petitioners thereto, this Hearing Officer finds no compelling reason for disturbing the findings made in the Order sought to be reconsidered, and thereto, said motions are hereby DENIED.


At the hearing on July 27, 1981, the motion of counsel for the respondent corporation requiring the petitioners who are in possession of the fishing vessels F/B Pacific I and II, to deliver said fishing vessels to the corporation was likewise considered. After considering the manifestation and arguments of both parties and upon suggestion of this Hearing Officer, the parties agreed that in lieu of the appointment of a receiver as prayed for by the petitioners in their motion of this Hearing Officer, the parties agreed that in lieu of the appointment of a receiver as prayed for by the petitioners in their motion to that effect and the delivery of the fishing vessels to the corporation as requested by counsel for the respondent corporation, a Management Committee be instead created. The petitioners and the respondents immediately nominated their representatives as members and the Chairman to be designated by the Commission.


As agreed upon by the parties, assisted by their respective counsels, a Management Committee is hereby created and constituted to be composed of Mrs. Marilyn Javier and Mr. Melecio Hernandez as members with Atty. Felipe S. Tongco of this Commission as Chairman. The said Committee, which shall at all times be under the control and supervision of this Commission shall have the following powers, functions and duties, to wit:






1. 	to take custody and possession of all assets, funds, properties and records of the corporation and to prepare an inventory thereof;


2. 	to administer, manage and preserve such assets, funds and records;


3. 	to receive any and all amounts, sums or money due and owing to the company and to deposit such amounts received in an appropriate bank for and in the account of the corporation; 


4.	to make such payments and disbursements in the ordinary course of business; 


5. 	to keep and maintain proper accounting records of each and every transaction of the company, particularly receipts and disbursements of funds; 


6. 	to submit to this Commission a detailed report on all receipts and disbursement of funds and such other reports as this Commission may require and 


7. 	to acquire, lease, sell mortgage or otherwise encumber such assets with the prior approval of this Commission. 


The parties, petitioners as well as defendants shall turn over to the Commission all the assets, funds, properties and records of the corporation in their possession including the vessels F/B Pacific I and II within five (5) days and to submit to the Commission within ten (10) days a complete inventory of all the assets, funds, properties and records of the corporation which are in their possession, in the presence of the Chairman and the members of the above committee 


Until further orders from this Commission, said Committee created pursuant to this Order shall have all the foregoing authorities and must discharge all the functions pertaining thereto as well as to perform such other duties as may be necessary in order to protect the interest of the corporation. 


The application of the petitioners for the provisional remedy of receivership is also hereby considered withdrawn. 


SO ORDERED.

ORDER 


Submitted for resolution is the manifestation and motion filed by the respondents to cite petitioners in contempt of this Commission and the opposition thereto filed by petitioners. 


In a manifestation and motion filed before this Commission on September 1, 1981, respondents alleged that in an order dated August 14, 1981, issued by the Commission, the parties, petitioners and respondents, were directed to turn over to the Management Committee formed thereat, all the assets, funds, properties and records of the corporation which are in their possession, including the vessels F/B Pacific I and Pacific II within five (5) days and to submit to the Commission within ten (10) days, a complete inventory of said assets, funds, properties and records of the corporation in the presence of the Chairman and members of the Management Committee; that more than five (5) days have elapsed since the receipt of the order of August 14, 1981 by the petitioners without the latter having complied with the directive to deliver the aforesaid vessels to the Commission; that each day of delay in the delivery of the possession of the aforestated vessel and. in the operation thereof by the Management Committee, deprived the corporation of sizeable earnings out of said vessels and that this failure of petitioners to comply with the Order, being willful and deliberate, constitute contumacious acts punishable under the New Rules of Procedure in the Securities and Exchange Commission. 


Petitioners, in opposing the motion for contempt, averred that they are not in possession of assets, funds, properties and records of the corporation which to the best of their knowledge are in the possession of respondent Cheng, that the fishing vessels F/B Pacific I and II are not assets of respondent corporation, petitioner Yamamoto having rescinded the sale in the exercise of his lien as an unpaid seller of the vessels and that petitioner Yamamoto is willing to consider arrangement whereby the vessels would be operated under the supervision of the Management Committee for the benefit of all the parties concerned, the rescission the sale of the vessels notwithstanding. ""Considering that one of the issues involved in this case is the ownership of the two (2) vessels, we consider it quite impractical for the petitioners to capitalize on this issue to justify their inability to comply with the Order of this Commission dated August 14, 1981. 


Unless, therefore, prevented by any supervening events, petitioners are duty bound to abide by the directive of this Commission for the delivery of the two (2) fishing boats to the Management Committee. Viewed from this perspective, we find petitioners' non-compliance with the Order of this Commission dated August 14, 1981 directing delivery of fishing boats P/B Pacific I and II, which are admittedly in their (petitioners) possession, to the Management Committee to be without any justifiable reason. 


WHEREFORE, petitioners are hereby found guilty of indirect contempt and fine of P1,000 plus an additional fine of P200 for every day of delay in the delivery of said vessels or non-compliance with the order is hereby imposed upon them without prejudice to imprisonment in case petitioners still fail to deliver the two (2) fishing boats within five (5) days from receipt of the Order. 


SO ORDERED. 


Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, September 29, 1981. (Pp. 57-59, Record) 


ORDER 


Acting upon the urgent ex-parte motion of defendant corporation dated October 6, 1981, and finding the same to be meritorious, said urgent ex-parte motion is hereby GRANTED. 


WHEREFORE, the Chairman of the Management Committee or his duly authorized representative is hereby directed to take possession of the fishing vessel, the PACIFIC II, wherever it may be found in Philippine waters and for the purpose, is hereby authorized 'to enlist the aid and support of any and all enforcement agencies of the government, civil or military'. pursuant to Sec. 3 of Presidential Decree No. 902-A.


SO ORDERED. 


Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines. 


October 6, 1981. (Page 60, Record) 






We are aware of the fact that up to the present respondent judge has not gone beyond issuing the above restraining order, notably requiring the filing of a bond. What has happened with the motion for a writ of preliminary injunction is not in the record. But assuming respondents should claim that the herein petition is premature considering there is no showing that respondent judge has not been asked to reconsider his impugned order and the incident on the preliminary injunction has not been resolved. Our ready answer is that We have opted to act now, for the simple reason that the invalidity of the challenged order is so manifest and patent, in fact and in law, that it would be a waste of time and actually an injustice to petitioners, if We delayed further disposition of the issues raised by them. We cannot imagine any different end result that subsequent actions of the parties or respondent judge could possibly affect Our conclusion regarding the utter lack of jurisdiction of respondent judge in the premises. 


As already portrayed above, the parties came within the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission on the basis of the complaint of herein petitioners. They claimed their controversy with private respondents involved intra-corporate matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of that body. The Commission took cognizance thereof, the parties discussed their respective positions before it, and on the issues joined by them, the Commission issued the orders above-quoted. 


If any or all of said orders are erroneous, the organic act creating the Commission, Presidential Decree 902-A, provides the appropriate remedy, first within the Commission itself, and ultimately in this Court. Nowhere does the law empower Court of First Instance to interfere with the orders of the Commission. Not even on grounds of due process or jurisdiction. The Commission is, conceding arguendo a possible claim of respondents, at the very least. a co-equal body with the Courts of First Instance. Even as such co-equal, one would have no power to control the other. But the truth of the matter is that only the Supreme Court can enjoy and correct any actuation of the Commission. (
Pineda vs. Lantin
, 6 SCRA 757)


Moreover, it is obvious that since the Commission has its offices outside of Manila, under settled jurisprudence, a Manila court's writ of preliminary injunction. much less a restraining order, can have no binding effect outside the Manila area. 


IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered setting aside the impugned order of herein respondent judge and making the restraining order heretofore issued by Us permanent. with costs against respondents. 


Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., De Castro, Ericta and Escolin JJ., concur. 


Abad Santos, J., concur in the result.
