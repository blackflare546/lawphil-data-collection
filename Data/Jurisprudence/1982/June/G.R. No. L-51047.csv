The petitioners appealed from the decision of the Court of Appeals, affirming the order of the Court of First Instance of Cebu in Special Proceeding No. 2703-R, Intestate Estate of Go Lian Seng, which directed Jovita Go, as administratrix, or the heirs to pay lawyer Caridad A. Trocino attorney's fees equivalent to fifteen percent of the net value of the estate amounting to P205,930.83 (CA-G.R. No. 49699-R, April 17, 1979). 


The appeal was given due course. The petitioners filed their brief. The case was submitted for decision without Trocino's brief. 


On May 25, 1982, the parties submitted the following compromise agreement, wherein they prayed that a decision be entered pursuant thereto and that the case be considered terminated:
