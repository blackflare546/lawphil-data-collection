MALCOLM, 
J.:
An important question in the law of insurance, not heretofore considered in this jurisdiction and, according to our information, not directly resolved in California from which State the Philippine Insurance Act was taken, must be decided on this appeal for the future guidance of trial courts and of insurance companies doing business in the Philippine Islands. This question, flatly stated, is whether a warranty referred to in the policy as forming part of the contract of insurance and in the form of a rider to the insurance policy, is null and void because not complying with the Philippine Insurance Act. The court has had the benefit of instructive briefs and memoranda from the parties and has also been assisted by a well prepared brief submitted on behalf of 
amici curiae
.


The admitted facts are these: Ang Giok Chip doing business under the name and style of Hua Bee Kong Si was formerly the owner of a warehouse situated at No. 643 Calle Reina Regente, City of Manila. The contents of the warehouse were insured with the three insurance companies for the total sum of P60,000. One insurance policy, in the amount of P10,000, was taken out with the Springfield Fire & Marine Insurance Company. The warehouse was destroyed by fire on January 11, 1928, while the policy issued by the latter company was in force.


Predicated on this policy the plaintiff instituted action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the defendant to recover a proportional part of the loss coming to P8,170.59. Four special defenses were interposed on behalf of the insurance company, one being planted on a violation of warranty F fixing the amount of hazardous goods which might be stored in the insured building. The trial judge in his decision found against the insurance company on all points, and gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P8,188.74. From this judgment the insurance company has appealed, and it is to the first and fourth errors assigned that we would address particular attention.


Considering the result at which we arrive, it is unnecessary for us to discuss three of the four special defenses which were made by the insurance company. We think, however, that it would be a reasonable deduction to conclude that more than 3 per cent of the total value of the merchandise contained in the warehouse constituted hazardous goods, and that this per cent reached as high as 39. We place reliance on the consular invoices and on the testimony of the adjuster, Herridge. Having thus swept to one side all intervening obstacle, the legal question recurs, as stated in the beginning of this decision, of whether or not warranty F was null and void.


To place this question in its proper light, we turn to the policy issued by the Springfield Fire & Marine Insurance Company in favor of the plaintiff. The description of the risk in this policy is as follows:

Ten thousand pesos Philippine Currency
. — On general 
non-hazardous merchandise
, chiefly consisting of chucherias, also produce, Cacao, Flour, all the property of the Insured, or held by them in trust, on commission or on joint account with others, or for which he is responsible, while contained during the currency of this policy in the godown, situate No. 643 Calle Reina Regent. . . .


This policy is subject to the hereon attached ""Ordinary Short Period Rate Scale"" 
Warranties A & F, Co-insurances Clause ""and Three Fourths Loss Clause,"" 
which are forming part of same
