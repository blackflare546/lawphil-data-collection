STREET, 
J.:


An intelligent conception of these case can be reached only through a knowledge of prior litigation to which they are related and from which they are in part derived. Many years ago proceeding were instituted by the Tuasons as owners of the Maysilo Estate in the municipality of Malabon, Province of Rizal, to register the estate under the Torrens system. Trouble arose with the occupants of various lots in the estate, and a compromise was effected by which opposition to the registration of the estate in the name of the Tuasons was withdrawn, with the understanding that one Nicolas Rivera should take an option on lots Nos. 27, 28 and 29. The first payment on this option, in the amount of P1,879, was made out of funds collected by Rivera as representative from the numerous intending purchasers. By the terms of this option, extended in the name of Rivera as purchaser, full payment was required within four years from January, 1918. As between Rivera and the Tuason estate, this contract was personal, his representative character not being recognized. Time passed and the rights of the tenants lapsed because of their failure to make further payments. Rivera, however, managed to transfer the option before it died to Remigia Sanchez. The latter in turn transferred it to Vicente Singson Encarnacion who, by paying the contract price for the property involved, secured a deed to the property and in the end obtained the certificate of transfer in his own name. Singson thereafter sold lot No. 28 to Vicente Arias and lots Nos. 27 and 29 to Baldomero Roxas, after which the occupants of parts of these lots for whom Rivera had originally undertaken to act instituted an action (Dizon 
vs
. Rivera, 48 Phil., 996), seeking to recover lots Nos. 27, 28 and 29 and to secure the cancellation of the successive transfers of the property from Rivera to Sanchez and through Singson, to the ultimate vendees. The effect of the decision of this court in that case was to deny the right of the plaintiffs to recover the land, with reservation to them of the right to obtain an accounting from Rivera for alleged breach of trust.


The following excerpt from the decision of this court in that case exhibits our conclusion in so far as affected the claim of the plaintiffs to the land:




. . . The plaintiffs acknowledged that the ownership of these lots was in the owners of the Maysilo Estate and they only obtained the option to buy these lots upon the conditions specified in the contract entered into with them. All that they did, through their representative Nicolas Rivera, in regard to this option was to pay the amount of P1,879, equivalent to 10 per cent of the purchase price of the lots; but this was not all that was necessary in order for them to acquire the ownership of these lots. In addition, they had to complete the payment of the purchase price within four years from January, 1918, failing in which their option would expire and the estate would be free to sell the lots to other persons. The plaintiffs, neither by themselves nor through their representative Nicolas Rivera, have paid the balance of the purchase price of these lots wherefore they have not acquired their ownership.




Going back now to the deed of December, 1919, from Rivera to Sanchez, we observe that in that conveyance Rivera reserved to himself the right to repurchase 40 hectares to be carved out of lots Nos. 27, 28 and 29. This right to repurchase was also noted in the conveyance from Sanchez to Singson, as well as in the later conveyance from Singson to Arias and Roxas. The result was that the last-named owners were obligated to respect Rivera's option to repurchase an area of 40 hectares. This obligation was not fixed upon any defined tract containing on the part of the vendees to allow Rivera to repurchase 40 hectares somewhere or anywhere within the confines of the three lots mentioned.

The existence of this reservation did not escape the attention of the litigants or of the court in 
Dizon vs. Rivera
, 
supra
; and while testifying as a witness in that case, Rivera explained that the purpose of the reservation was to protect those of the occupants who had bought and had paid, or were paying, for specified amounts of land in the three lots.


Attention is thus roughly drawn to the fact that there were two classes of occupants on the land, namely, those who had never done anything more than to make the first payment on the original option through Rivera, and those who continued their payments and ultimately completed the same. These two classes of person will appear as opposing parties in the litigation now before us, the first class comprising the plaintiffs (hereinafter to be referred to as Baguinguito and associates); and the second class comprising the intervenors-appellees (to be referred to as Pilares and associates). In testifying as a witness in the litigation above referred to, Rivera gave the names of the individual who had continued their payments and in whose favor consequently the reservation of right of repurchase was principally made. These individuals were subsequently introduced to Singson by Rivera, and to Singson the final payments were made through M.P. Leuterio, agent of Singson. It is pretended by the appellants in this case that the payments above-mentioned were never in fact made. But everybody who had may interest in receiving the money admits its payment and the receipts, though involved in a little confusion, sufficiently prove that those payments in fact were made, as the trial court found.


We have said that the reservation of 40 hectares was made in the interest of those occupants who had completed or were completing their payments, a statement which is not exactly true, for the land to be allocated to them was only part of the area reserved. The other portion was intended for other individuals who were outsiders, namely, Julio Gregorio, Jose B. Sanchez, M.P. Leuterio, and Judge Fermin Mariano, whose rights are in the main undisputed.


During the litigation which terminated in 
Dizon vs. Rivera 
(48 Phil., 996), transfer of the property involved in that dispute were held in abeyance, but after that case had been terminated and the title of Singson and his successors to lots Nos. 27, 28 and 29 had been declared indefeasible, the problem presented itself as to the most convenient method of conveying to Pilares and associates the amount of land to which they were severally entitled; and as the demon of confusion would have it, it was decided that the land intended for Pilares and associates should be reconveyed to Rivera, and that he, in turn, should thereupon transfer the several smaller lots to the individuals respectively entitled thereto. A transfer to him was accordingly effected, and a certificate of title was issued to him covering the land intended for the prospective owners.


With all due respect to the aforesaid demon of confusion, we further note that Pilares and associates were already occupants in fact of discrete parcel, and the owners of the larger mass found that if they conveyed to Pilares and associates the particular parcels already occupied by them, the larger mass would be ruined by the irregular division. It was therefore decided, with the consent of the persons entitled, to convey to the intending owners the appropriate amount of land in a mass, their separate lots being in juxtaposition with one another. It was also agreed that the land so to be allotted should be carved out of the precise area then occupied by Baguinguito and associates, who had been unsuccessful plaintiffs in the litigation lately concluded but who were still in possession of the lots originally held by them. The necessary separate conveyance were therefore made to Pilares and associates, but these transfer have not as yet been followed by the issuance of the Torrens certificates, on account of the pendency of the litigation now before us.


At this point we must interrupt what appears to be the natural sequence of things to call attention to another case, wherein Manuel de Guia, one of the losing plaintiffs in Dizon 
vs
. Rivera, 
supra
, sued Rivera, Singson and Arias for the purpose of recovering some 3 hectares out of the 40 reserved for Rivera in his deed to Sanchez. The trial court decided against De Guia, and upon appeal to the Supreme Court the decision was affirmed (De Guia 
vs
. Rivera, G.R. No. 29677)
 1
. The vital point in the decision was that the case was merely an attempt to get what had been sought in 
Dizon vs. Rivera
, and it was held that the last-named case constituted a conclusive decision against the alleged right of the plaintiff.


But, to resume the main narrative, it will be remembered that Baguinguito and associates, one of the two elements comprising the parties plaintiff in 
Dizon vs. Rivera supra
, had a grievance against Rivera arising from his alleged breach of trust towards them. These individuals, therefore, now finding Rivera in possession of the legal title to the land held by him for the benefit of Pilares and associates, descended upon him in the two actions now before us, instituted on March 10 and October 28, 1926, in the Court of First Instance of Rizal. In the first of these actions (civil case No. 3262), Martin Baguinguito and others are plaintiffs, while Nicolas Rivera is the defendant. In the second action (civil case No. 3478), Raymundo Andres and others are plaintiffs and Nicolas Rivera defendant. The purpose of each of the two actions is primarily to obtain an accounting for various sums of money received by Rivera from them, as well as to recover the profits received by him from selling the option to Sanchez. But the plaintiffs further seek in these actions to recover severally various parcels of land out of the 40 hectares reserved for Rivera in the conveyance to Sanchez and in part already conveyed to him as above stated.


In these actions Pilares and associates, altogether ten in number, intervened, asserting their rights to the parcels conveyed to them in the deeds previously executed in their favor by Rivera. Also, Manuel de Guia, undaunted by his previous ill-success as a litigant, intervened, claiming the same property that had been denied to him in the prior litigation. Other individuals also intervened, with whom we are not so extensively concerned, namely, M.P. Leuterio and persons claiming under him. The two actions, identical in their principal features, were consolidated for the purpose of trial and were disposed of by the trial court in a single opinion. Meanwhile Rivera had died and his estate was, at the time of the decision, represented by Emilio Rivera as his administrator.


The appealed decision has a number of dispositive provisions, but the only parts of it that are brought into discussion in this appeal are those relating to the title of the land which had been conveyed back to Rivera and which has been deeded by him to the appellees in these cases or their predecessors in interest. The basic point in the decision is that all these individuals are the lawful owners of the parcel thus conveyed and that, on the contrary, the plaintiffs in the two actions, including the intervenor De Guia, have no enforceable legal claim to any part of it. In order to carry this fundamental finding into effect, the trial judge ordered that the certificate of title in the name of Rivera covering this land should be cancelled and that other certificate for various portions thereof should be issued to the following individuals in the amount stated, to wit:"
