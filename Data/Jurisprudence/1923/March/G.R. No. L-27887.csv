I. That the plaintiff is a corporation duly organized, registered, and doing business under the laws of the Philippine Islands, with its principal office in the City of Manila and with branches in the City of Cebu, Province of Cebu, and in the City of Iloilo, Province of Iloilo; and that the defendant is the duly appointed, qualified, and acting Collector of Internal Revenue of the Philippine Islands.

In addition to which, H. Gassel, the Vice-President of the plaintiff, was called and testified as a witness for the plaintiff. Upon this testimony and the stipulated facts, the lower court rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the full amount of its claim. On appeal the defendant contends that the trial court erred in holding that the plaintiff did not act as a commission merchant, and in denying defendant's motion for a new trial. 




JOHNS, 
J.:


It appears from the testimony of Mr. Gassel, Vice-President of the plaintiff, that it had an arrangement with Neuss, Hesslin, a foreign corporation, to represent it in Cebu and Iloilo, and that the sales taxes on all of such sales were paid by the corporation, and that later the defendant demanded from the plaintiff the payment of another and a different tax, which was paid under protest. That O. Schuthless, and Mr. Meyer were the agents of the plaintiff, and that ""they were made by the two agents in Iloilo and Cebu, but they were agents of Neuss, Hesslin, Corporation; the two agents were representatives of Neuss, Hesslin, Corporation,"" and that the offices of the two firms ""were in the same house but they had separate offices,"" and that the books of the two agencies were kept separately, and that sales made by the two agents were also made separately. 




Q. How are the orders obtained by your agency? — A. When any of the agencies asked for goods, they ordered them directly from the Neuss, Hesslin Corporation and F. E. Zuellig, Inc.




On cross-examination, the witness testified that Meyer and Schulthess were the agents at Cebu of both the plaintiff and the Neuss, Hesslin Corporation, and that the expenses of the branch of the office at that place were paid by the plaintiff, and that it received ""a commission to pay for the expenses and gain something."" 




Q. Did not Walter Meyer and O. Schulthess receive any commission from the Neuss, Hesslin Corporation for the sales mentioned in the complaint? — A. They themselves know; the commission pertaining to them was transferred to the firm of F. E. Zuellig, because the firm of F. E. Zuellig paid the expenses.


Q. You said that the firm of F. E. Zuellig, Inc., receives a certain commission from Neuss, Hesslin Corporation; in what does that commission consist? — A. The commission consists in a certain per cent upon the sale, for instance, 5 per cent or 3 per cent.


Q. And why is that commission given? — A. As F. E. Zuellig, Inc., paid all the expenses, the commission was a compensation to cover those expenses and to gain something if there is any gain.




In answer to the question as to why that commission was paid, the witness testified: 




A. This arrangement was made to the effect that F. E. Zuellig, Inc., should represent Neuss, Hesslin Corporation in Iloilo and Cebu, because from the beginning it was seen that to maintain two separate offices with all the expenses also separate would be a failure, would be a loss, that is why we combined the two houses; that is to say, we already had or F. E. Zuellig already had his office with all his employees, and as Neuss, Hesslin Corporation saw that it was impossible to do business in Iloilo and Cebu through a representative with employees on account of the great expenses to be made, such as the payment of the rent of the house and the salaries of the employees, and as we already had our office and our employees, so that combination was made, giving us a certain commission for our labor and our expenses and especially for the labor of our agency.


Q. For the labor of whom? — A. Of the agent.


Q. But those gentlemen Messrs. Walter Meyer and O. Schuthess are agents of F. E. Zuellig, are they not? — A. At the same time.


Q. What do you mean by that? — A. They are agents of F. E. Zuellig, Inc., and at the same time agents of Neuss, Hesslin Corporation.




From which it appears that the goods, wares and merchandise of the foreign corporation were shipped to, and delivered in, the 
bodega 
of the plaintiff at Cebu, and when sold they were distributed from its warehouse to the purchasers. That Schuthess and Meyer were the agents of both the plaintiff and the Neuss, Hesslin Corporation, and that for such sales, the plaintiff received a commission of from 3 to 5 per cent of the amount of such sales. 


Among other things, section 1459 of the Administrative Code provides: 




""Merchant,"" as here used, means a person engaged in the sale, barter, or exchange of personal property of whatever character. Except as specially provided, the term includes manufacturers who sell articles of their own production and commission merchants having establishments of their own for the keeping and disposal of goods of which sales or exchanges are effected, but does not include merchandise brokers.




In the instant case, the record is conclusive that the plaintiff had an establishment of its own in Cebu for the keeping and disposal of goods of which sales or exchanges were effected. As stated, the plaintiff was the owner of the 
bodega 
in which the goods, wares and merchandise were received, stored and kept, and from and out of which they were delivered by the agents, to the different purchasers to whom the sales were made, and for and on account of which sales, the plaintiff received a commission ranging from 3 to 5 per cent. 


Upon the admitted facts, we are clearly of the opinion that as to the transactions in question, the plaintiff was a commission merchant within the meaning of the provisions of section 1459 above quoted. It had an establishment of its own for the keeping and disposal of the goods of the Neuss, Hesslin Corporation, from and out of which the sales were made. This construction is materially strengthened by section 1453 of the Administrative Code which provides: 




Privilege taxes on business and occupation
. — A privilege tax must be paid before any business or occupation hereinafter specified can be lawfully began or pursued. The tax on business is payable for every separate or distinct establishment or place where business subject to the tax is conducted; and one occupation or line of business does not become exempt by being conducted with some other occupation or business for which such tax has been paid.




In the final analysis and upon the stipulated facts, the plaintiff was a commission merchant as to the sales in question and had a 
bodega 
of its own for the keeping and disposal of the goods from which the sales were made. It is true that upon such facts one sale only was made, but it is also true that such sales were made by and through the plaintiff as a commission merchant upon the terms and conditions specified and defined in section 1459 above quoted. 


The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and one will be entered here for the defendant, with costs. So ordered. 


Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romuadez and Villa-Real, JJ., concur.

Johnson, J., reserves his vote.
