On March 5, 1957, petitioner-appellee, Maria Natividad vda. de Tan filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila a verified petition for 
mandamus
 seeking an order to compel the respondent-appellant Veterans Back Pay Commission: (1) to declare deceased Lt. Tan Chiat Bee

Manila, July 31, 1957.




Based on the foregoing, the lower court rendered judgment the dispositive portion of which, reads:




Wherefore
, the petition is granted, ordering respondent Commission to give due course to the claim of herein petitioner to the backpay to which her deceased husband was entitled as member of a duly recognized guerrilla organization.




Against the decision, the respondent instituted this appeal averring once more, in its assignment of errors, the special and affirmative defenses that the petitioner failed to exhaust available administrative remedies; that the suit is, in effect, an action to enforce a money claim against the government without its consent; that 
mandamus
 will not lie to compel the exercise of Ťa discretionary function; and that the Republic Act Nos. 304 and Ť897 already referred to were never intended to benefit aliens.


We find no merit in the appeal. As to the claim that 
mandamus
 is not the proper remedy to correct the exercise of discretion of the Commission, it may well be remembered that its discretion is limited to the facts of the case, i.e., in merely evaluating the evidence whether or not the claimant is a member of a guerrilla force duly recognized by the United States Army. Nowhere in the law is the respondent Commission given the power to adjudicate or determine rights after such facts are established. Having been satisfied that deceased Tan Chiat Bee was an officer of a duly recognized guerrilla outfit, certified to by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, having served under the United States-Chinese Volunteers in the Philippines, a guerrilla unit recognized by the United States army and forming part of the Philippine Army, it becomes the 
ministerial duty
 of the respondent to give due course to his widow's application. (See sections 1 and 6, Republic Act Ť897). Note that the Chief of the Finance Service, Camp Murphy, has accepted the backpay due the petitioner's husband and the same was passed in audit by the representatives of the Auditor General.


It is insisted by the respondent Commission that aliens are not included within the purview of the law. We disagree. The law is contained in Republic Act Nos. 304 and 897 is explicit enough, and it extends its benefits to members of ""guerrilla forces duly recognized by the Army of the United States."" From the plain and clear language thereof, we fail to see any indication that its operation should be limited to citizens of the Philippines only, for all that is required is that the guerrilla unit be duly recognized by the Army of the United States. We are in full accord with Opinion No. 213, series of 1956, of the Secretary of Justice, which reads:




Section 1 of the cited Act (Republic act No. 304, as amended by Republic Act No. 897), otherwise known as the Back Pay Law, recognizes the rights to the backpay of members of ""
guerrilla forces duly recognized by the Army of the United States
, among others. A perusal of its provisions reveals nothing which may be construed to mean that only Filipino citizens are entitled to back pay thereunder. On the contrary, the statute expressly includes within its coverage ""persons under contract with the Government of the Commonwealth"", which clause was construed by this office to refer to service"" by the government (Opinion No. Ť137, s. 1953), a majority of whom were non-citizens. Thus, the Opinion No. 30, s. 1949, this office ruled that a civil service employee of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey rendering the service to the Philippine Government when war broke out on December 8, 1941, was entitled to back pay.


As regards guerrillas, it seems clear that all the law requires is that they be ""duly recognized by the Army of the United States."" Section 1 of the Back Pay Law, it is also noted, enumerates those who are not entitled to its benefits; recognized guerrillas who were not Filipino citizens are not among those expressly mentioned. The maxim 
expressio unius est exclusio alterius
, I think, finds application here.


Moreover, Executive Order No. 21, dated October 28, 1944, expressly declared that, Sections 22 (a) and 27 of Commonwealth Act No. 1 to the contrary notwithstanding, ""all persons of 
any nationality or citizenship
, who are actively serving in recognized military forces in the Philippines, are thereby considered to be on active service in the Philippine Army.""




It is the respondent's main argument that it could not have been the intention of Congress to extend its benefit to aliens, as the purpose of the law was ""precisely to help rehabilitate members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and recognized guerrillas by giving them the right to acquire public lands and public property by using the back pay certificate"", and ""it is fundamental under the Constitution that aliens except American citizens cannot acquire public lands or exploit our natural resources"". Respondent Commission fails to realize that this is just one of the various uses of the certificate; and that it may also be utilized for the payment of obligations to the Government or to any of its branches or instrumentalities, i.e., taxes, government hospital bills, etc. (See Sec. 2, Rep. act No. 897).


As further observed by the lower court:




It is one thing to be entitled to backpay and to receive acknowledgment therefor, and another thing to receive backpay certificates in accordance with the resolutions of the Commission and to make use of the same.




It was, therefore, unreasonable if not arbitrary on the part of respondent Commission to deny petitioner's claim on the basis.


It is further contended by the Commission that the petitioner should have first exhausted her administrative remedies by appealing to the President of the Philippines, and that her failure to do so is a bar to her action in court (Montes 
vs.
 The Civil Service Board of Appeals, 101 Phil., 490; 54 Off. Gaz. [7] 2174. The respondent Commission is in estoppel to invoke this rule, considering that in its resolution (Annex F of the Stipulation of Facts) reiterating its obstinate refusal to abide by the opinion of the Secretary of Justice, who is the legal adviser of the Executive Department, the Commission declared that — 




The opinions promulgated by the Secretary of Justice are advisory in nature, which may either be accepted or ignored by the office seeking the opinion, and any aggrieved party has the court for recourse, (Annex F)




thereby leading the petitioner to conclude that only a final judicial ruling in her favor would be accepted by the Commission.


Neither is there substance in the contention that the petition is, in effect, a suit against the government without its consent. the relief prayed for is simply ""the recognition of the petitioner-appellee"" under the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of Republic Act No. 897, and consists in ""directing an agency of the government to perform an act . . . it is bound to perform."" Republic Act Nos. 304 and 897 necessarily embody state consent to an action against the officers entrusted with the implementation of said Acts in case of unjustified refusal to recognize the rights of proper applicants.


The decision appealed from should be, and hereby is, affirmed. No costs. So ordered.
