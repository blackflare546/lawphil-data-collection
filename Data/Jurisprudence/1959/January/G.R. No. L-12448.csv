That in the commission of this crime the following aggravating circumstance were present, to wit: (1) recidivism with respect to Jose Vicente only, (2) that the accused has been previously punished for two or more crimes to which it attaches a lighter penalty, (3) evident premeditation, (4) with cruelty, the wrong done in the commission of the crime having been deliberately augmented by causing other wrong not necessary for its commission, and (5) quasi-recidivism, the said accused having committed this crime after having been convicted by final judgments of competent courts and while serving said judgments.


Contrary to law.


Malolos, Bulacan, March 28, 1957.




To this information, both defendants pleaded guilty, whereupon, the lower court rendered judgment sentencing them to suffer the penalty of death to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Ernesto Palangue in the sum of P6,000.00, to suffer all the accessory penalties provided for by law and to pay the costs.


The death penalty having been imposed, records of the case were forwarded to this Court for review, pursuant to the provisions of Section 9, Rule 118 of the Rules of Court.


The conviction must stand. The records disclose that at the arraignment, the accused were assisted by a counsel 
de officio 
appointed by the presiding Judge. Counsel was given time to confer and did confer with the defendants before entering their plea of guilty. There appears to be no doubt that their plea were given voluntarily and spontaneously. Under these facts, no irregularity was committed by the lower court..


New counsel 
de officio
 in this review, however, contends that it was error for the lower court to consider against the accused the aggravating as well as the qualifying circumstances stated in the information, there having been no hearing ordered by the said court at least investigate the facts that were alleged as giving rise to those circumstances.


In several cases, this Court had occasion to rule that a plea of guilty removes all the necessity of presenting evidence of the crime charged and is sufficient to sustain a conviction, 
even a capital offense
, without any further evidence (People vs. Acosta, 98 Phil., 642; 52 Off. Gaz. 1930; People vs. Rapirap, (102 Phil., 863 54 Off. Gaz.[23] 6072), the requisite proof having been supplied by the accused himself. By the plea of guilty, all the facts alleged in the information are deemed admitted (People vs. Lambino, 103 Phil., 504; 55 Off. Gaz., [9], 1965). The taking of further evidence, including the ascertainment of circumstances with affect criminal liability, rests entirely upon the sound discretion of the court (People vs. Triompo, 100 Phil., 83; 52 Off. Gaz. No. 15, p. 6514; People vs. Acosta, 
supra
). Thus, in the Acosta case, this Court said:




This Court has already declared that the essence of the plea of guilty in a criminal trial is that the accused, on arraignment, admits his guilt freely, voluntarily and with full knowledge of the consequences and meaning of his act, and with a clear understanding of the precise nature of the crime charged in the information; that when formally entered, such a plea is sufficient to sustain a conviction of any offense charged in the information, even a 
capital offense
, without the introduction of further evidence, the defendant having himself supplied the necessary proof; and that while it may be prudent and advisable in some cases, especially where grave crimes are charged, to take additional evidence as to the guilt of the accused and the circumstances attendant upon the commission of the crime, nevertheless it lies in the sound discretion of the court whether to take evidence or not in any cases where it is satisfied the plea of guilty has been entered by the accused with full knowledge of the meaning and consequences of his act (U.S. 
vs
. Jamad, 37 Phil., 305; U.S. 
vs
. Burlado, 42 Phil., 72; People 
vs
. Santa Rosa, 88 Phil., 487; People 
vs
. Sabilul, 89 Phil., 283). (52 Off. Gaz. No. 4, p. 1932).




The aggravating circumstances in this case mostly appear from official records, and it must have been for this reason that counsel 
de officio
 in the court below did not ask the court for inquiry into the circumstances of the crime, but assented into their entering a plea of guilty notwithstanding the serious consequences that said plea entailed. Moreover, no attempt was made, after passing of the death sentence, to ask the court to reopen the hearing for reception of evidence in defense of mitigation of liability, evidently because no such evidence existed.


It is well to note that even discarding the circumstances of premeditation and cruelty, sufficient aggravating circumstances remain, not only to offset the plea of guilty but to raise the penalty to the maximum provided by law, specially in view of Art. 160 of the Revised Penal Code.


We find no error in the judgment appealed from and, much to our regret, find no alternative but to affirm the judgment and sentence now under review. So ordered.
