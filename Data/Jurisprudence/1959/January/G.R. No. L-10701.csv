REYES, J.B.L.,

In an amended decision dated October 9, 1951, issued in Land Registration Case No. 12, G.L.R.O. Rec. No. 2835, the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon decreed the registration of Lots Nos. 1798 and 1799 of the Juban (Sorsogon) Cadastre, under the following terms and conditions:




In view of the foregoing, and it appearing that the notices have been duly published and posted as required by law, and that the title of the applicant to the above-mentioned two parcels of land is registrable in law, it is hereby adjudged and decreed, and with reaffirmation of the order of general default, that the two parcels of land described in plan SWO-24152, known as Lots Nos. 1798 and 1799 of the Cadastral Survey of Juban, with their improvements, be registered in the name of Maria Cano, Filipina, 71 years of age, widow and resident of Juban, province of Sorsogon, with the understanding that Lot No. 1799 shall be subject to the right of 
reserva
tion in favor of Eustaquia Guerrero pursuant to Article 891 of the Civil code. After this decision shall have become final for lack of appeal therefrom within the 30-day period from its promulgation, let the corresponding decree issue.


So ordered. (Rec. App. pp. 18-19)




The decision having become final, the decree and the Certificate of Title (No. 0-20) were issued in the name of Maria Cano, subject to 
reserva troncal
 in favor of Eustaquia Guerrero. In October 1955, counsel for the reserve (
reservatorio
) Guerrero filed a motion with the Cadastral Court, alleging the death of the original registered owner and 
reservista
, Maria Cano, on September 8, 1955, and praying that the original Certificate of Title be ordered cancelled and a new one issued in favor of movant Eustaquia Guerrero; and that the Sheriff be ordered to place her in possession of the property. The motion was opposed by Jose and Teotimo Fernandez, sons of the 
reservista
 Maria Cano, who contended that the application and operation of the 
reserva troncal
 should be ventilated in an ordinary contentious proceeding, and that the Registration Court did not have jurisdiction to grant the motion.


In view of the recorded 
reserva
 in favor of the appellee, as expressly noted in the final decree of registration, the lower court granted the petition for the issuance of a new certificate, for the reason that the death of the 
reservista
 vested the ownership of the property in the petitioner as the sole 
reservatorio troncal
.


The oppositors, heirs of the 
reservista
 Maria Cano, duly appealed from the order, insisting that the ownership of the 
reservatorio
 can not be decreed in a mere proceeding under sec. 112 of Act 496, but requires a judicial administration proceedings, wherein the rights of appellee, as the 
reservatorio
 entitled to the reservable property, are to be declared. In this connection, appellants argue that the reversion in favor of the 
reservatorio
 requires the declaration of the existence of the following facts:




(1) The property was received by a descendant by gratuitous title from an ascendant or from a brother or sister;


(2) Said descendant dies without issue;


(3) The property is inherited by another ascendant by operation of law; and


(4) The existence of relatives within the third degree belonging the line from which said property came. (Appellants' Brief, p. 8)




We find the appeal untenable. The requisites enumerated by appellants have already been declared to exist by the decree of registration wherein the rights of the appellee as 
reservatario troncal
 were expressly recognized:




From the above-quoted agreed stipulation of facts, it is evident that Lot No. 1799 was acquired by the Appellant Maria Cano by inheritance from her deceased daughter, Lourdes Guerrero who, in turn, inherited the same from her father Evaristo Guerrero and, hence, falls squarely under the provisions of Article 891 of the Civil Code; and that each and everyone of the private oppositors are within the third degree of consaguinity of the decedent Evaristo Guerrero, and who belonging to the same line from which the property came.


It appears however, from the agreed stipulation of facts that with the exception of Eustaquia Guerrero, who is the only living daughter of the decedent Evaristo Guerrero, by his former marriage, all the other oppositors are grandchildren of the said Evaristo Guerrero by his former marriages. Eustaquia Guerrero, being the nearest of kin, excludes all the other private oppositors, whose decree of relationship to the decedent is remoter (Article 962, Civil Code; Director of Lands 
vs
. Aguas, 62 Phil., 279). (Rec. App. pp. 16-17)




This decree having become final, all persons (appellees included) are bared thereby from contesting the existence of the constituent elements of the 
reserva
. The only requisites for the passing of the title from the 
reservista
 to the appellee are: (1) the death of the 
reservista
; and (2) the fact that the 
reservatario
 has survived the 
reservista
. Both facts are admitted, and their existence is nowhere questioned.


The contention that an intestacy proceeding is still necessary rests upon the assumption that the 
reservatario 
will succeed in, or inherit, the 
reserva
ble property from the 
reservista
. This is not true. The 
reservatario
 is not the 
reservista's
 successor 
mortis causa
 nor is the 
reserva
ble property part of the 
reservista
's estate; the 
reservatario
 receives the property as a conditional heir of the descendant (
 prepositus
), said property merely reverting to the line of origin from which it had temporarily and accidentally strayed during the 
reservista
's lifetime. The authorities are all agreed that there being 
reservatarios
 that survive the 
reservista
, the latter must be deemed to have enjoined no more than a life interest in the 
reserva
ble property.


It is a consequence of these principles that upon the death of the 
reservista
, the 
reservatario
 nearest to the
 prepositus
 (the appellee in this case) becomes, automatically and by operation of law, the owner of the reservable property. As already stated, that property is no part of the estate of the 
reservista
, and does not even answer for the debts of the latter. Hence, its acquisition by the
 reservatario
 may be entered in the property records without necessity of estate proceedings, since the basic requisites therefor appear of record. It is equally well settled that the 
reserva
ble property can not be transmitted by a 
reservista
 to her or his own successors 
mortis causa
,(like appellants herein) so long as a 
reservatario
 within the third degree from the prepositus and belonging to the line whence the property came, is in existence when the
 reservista
 dies.


Of course, where the registration decree merely specifies the 
reserva
ble character of the property, without determining the identity of the 
reservatario
 (as in the case of Director of Lands 
vs
. Aguas, 63 Phil., 279) or where several 
reservatario
s dispute the property among themselves, further proceedings would be unavoidable. But this is not the case. The rights of the 
reservataria
 Eustaquia Guerrero have been expressly recognized, and it is nowhere claimed that there are other 
reservatario
s of equal or nearer degree. It is thus apparent that the heirs of the 
reservista
 are merely endeavoring to prolong their enjoyment of the 
reserva
ble property to the detriment of the party lawfully entitled thereto.


We find no error in the order appealed from and therefore, the same is affirmed with costs against appellants in both instances. So ordered.
