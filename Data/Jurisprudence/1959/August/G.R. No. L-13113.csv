BAUTISTA ANGELO, 
J
.:


This case before this Court on a petition for 
certiorari
 filed by Blas praying for the review of thedecision rendered by the Court of Appeals on September 26, 1957, affirming the judgment of the lower court which holds that its decision on the merits has already become final and executory.


This petition stems from a case originally filed before the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental wherein Blas Elnar prayed to be declared the owner of a parcel of land known as Lot No. 1182 of the Cadastral Survey of Dumaguete. Decision was rendered in favor of defendants declaring them the owners of the land and awarding in their favor attorney's fees in the amount of P1,000.00.Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, which wasdenied, and when he tried to appeal from the decision,the trial court declared that the motion for reconsiderationhe had filed was merely
 pro forma
 and did not suspendthe running of the period to appeal. Accordingly, thetrial court held that its decision was already final and executory.


Plaintiff filed a petition for 
mandamus
 with the Courtof Appeals in an attempt to secure an order directingthe trial court to give due course to his appeal, but theCourt of Appeals in a decision rendered on September26, 1957, denied the petition. Hence the present petitionfor review.


It appears that the trial court rendered judgment inthe main case on February 18, 1957, dismissing plaintiff'scomplaint but ordering him to pay defendants the sum ofP1,000.00 as attorney's fees and the costs of action. Notice of this decision was served on plaintiff's counsel onMarch 28, 1957. On April 25, 1957, plaintiff's counselfiled a motion for reconsideration or new trial. On May9, 1957, the trial court denied the motion holding that itwas merely
 pro forma
 and as such did not suspend theperiod to appeal. This ruling was affirmed by the Courtof Appeals.


The question to be determined is whether said motionfor reconsideration or new trial is merely
 pro forma
 anddid not suspend the period to appeal.


Because of its intimate bearing on our discussion wequote hereunder the motion under reconsideration:

and/or NEW TRIAL.

Under section 2, Rule 37, a motion for new trial shallbe made in writing stating the ground or grounds therefor,notice of which shall be served on the adverse party.When the motion is made upon the ground that ""theevidence was insufficient to justify the decision, or it isagainst the law,"" the motion shall point out specificallythe findings or conclusion of the judgment which are notsupported by the evidence or which are contrary to law,making express reference to the testimonial or documentaryevidence or to the provisions of law alleged to becontrary to such findings or conclusions.


Former Chief Justice Moran, commenting on the abovementionedprovisions, says: ""Where a motion for new trial is filed under the third paragraph of this section and fails`to point out specifically the findings or conclusions of thejudgment which are not supported by the evidence or whichare contrary to law, making express reference to thetestimonial or documentary evidence or to the provisions of lawalleged to be contrary to such findings or conclusions', itshall be treated as a motion
 pro forma
 intended merely todelay the proceedings and it shall not interrupt or suspendthe period of time for the perfection of an appeal.

However
,where the motion for reconsideration was based on a claim that the finding of the trial court as to the authenticityof the disputed signature was not justified by theevidence submitted, which is the testimony of the expertwitness denying such authenticity, 
the motion points outwhy the finding of the court is not justified by theevidence, and is clearly not a pro forma motion for new trialor reconsideration
; such motion for reconsiderationsuspends the period for perfecting an appeal.""

Analyzing the averments made by petitioner in hismotion for reconsideration we find that he attributes to thetrial court two errors: One is on ""questions of fact"" andanother on ""questions of law."" As to the former, hepoints out the findings or conclusions of the trial courtwhich in his opinion are supported by the evidence,although he does not make any express reference to suchevidence, and as to the latter he also points out specificallythe findings or conclusions which in his opinion arecontrary to law. We likewise find that plaintiff expresslyreserved his right to submit written or oral argument tosubstantiate his motion within such period of time as theCourt may grant him, which request was however ignoredwhen the Court denied outright his motion for reconsideration.


We believe that the above averments when consideredin the light of the decision on the merits may be consideredsubstantial compliance with the rule and may come underthe exception pointed out by former Chief Justice Moran.Here is where we may properly apply the principle thatthe rules shall be liberally construed in order to promote the interest of justice.


Another reason why the petition for mandamus wasdismissed by the Court of Appeals is the allegation not deniedby respondent that as of June 14, 1957, long before saidpetition was filed, plaintiff has satisfied the judgment ofthe trial court from which he is now seeking to appeal.This point needs clarification. Plaintiff's main action is torecover the ownership and possession of a parcel of landwhich was dismissed by the trial court even it awardedto defendants attorney's fees in the a amount of P1,000.000.It is from this dismissal that plaintiff is now appealingalthough incidentally he is also disputing the award ofattorney's fees. What was executed over plaintiff's oppositionis the award of attorney's fees. Payment, therefore,of said fees cannot be deemed an abandonment of hisappeal from the dismissal of his main cause of action. Eventhen such payment cannot be taken as abandonment becauseit was forced upon him through a writ of execution.And considering that under our rule a judgment may beexecuted even pending appeal if the trial court, in theexercise of its discretion, finds good reason therefor(sec. 2, Rule 39), there is no plausible reason for holdingthat payment by plaintiff of said attorney's fees constitutesand abandonment of his appeal.


Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed.The trial court is hereby ordered to give due course tothe appeal of petitioner.
