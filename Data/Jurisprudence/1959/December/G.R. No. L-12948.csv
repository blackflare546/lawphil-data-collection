BENGZON, 
J.:


This is a petition for 
certiorari
 to review and reverse the decision of respondent Court of Agrarian Relations of August 20, 1957, requiring Martial Vital to reinstate Pastor Magtoto as tenant of a certain piece of land owned by the former Mexico, Pampanga.


We find such petition to be out of the time, because: (a) petitioner received copy of the August 26, 1957; (b) he moved for reconsideration on September 9, 1957, which motion was denied on September 20, 1957; (c) he receive notice of denial on October 1, 1957; but he filed this petition only on October 7, 1957; i.e. five days late. The law requires this petitions to be filed within fifteen (15) days from the notice of the decision.
 1
Supposing the motion reconsideration suspended the period, this is the computation: From August 26 to October 7, forty-two days elapse; and from September 9 to October 1, twenty-two days. Deducting the latter period (22) time when the motion for reconsideration was pending) from the total number of days (42), the result is twenty days.
 2
Therefore, this petition for review was presented twenty days after August 26. Very late; and this Court has no jurisdiction to revise the proceeding.
