The defendants are hereby absolved of the plaintiff's claim of P587.60 and the bond executed by the defendants for said sum is hereby declared of no effect.


In the event the defendant Fidelity and Surety Company of the Philippine Islands should pay herein sum of P2,844.46 unto the plaintiff, the defendant Macondray and Surety Company, inc. is hereby ordered to reimburse the said Fidelity and Surety Company the same amount. With costs against defendants.


SO ORDERED.


Manila, Philippines, September 28, 1956.




The defendant taxpayer filed a petition to review that part of the judgment adverse to it. The defendant surety company did not.


Section 183, paragraph (A), of the national Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 253, partly provides:




The percentage taxes on business shall be payable at the end of each calendar quarter in the amount lawfully due on the business transacted during each quarter; and it shall be the duty of every person conducting a business on which a percentage tax is imposed under this Title, within twenty days after the end of each calendar quarter, to make a true and complete return of the amount of the gross sales, receipts or earnings, or gross value of output actually removed from the factory or mill warehouse, during the preceding calendar quarter and pay the tax thereon: . . . .




Paragraph (B) of the same section and Code, as amended, partly provides:




In the case of imported articles, the percentage taxes established in sections one hundred and eighty-four, one hundred eighty-five and one hundred and eighty six of this Code shall be paid in advance by the importer, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Finance and prior to the release of such articles from customs' custody, based on the total value thereof at the time they are received by the importer, including freight, postage, insurance, commission, customs duty and all similar charges. In the case of locally produced or manufactured articles, the percentage taxes established in the said sections shall likewise be paid in advance on the total value thereof prior to removal from the producer's or manufacturer's warehouse. The amount so paid in advance in accordance with this subsection shall be credited against the percentage taxes due on the sales by the taxpayer for each calendar quarter.




Pursuant to the foregoing provision of law, on 16 June 1948 the Secretary of Finance promulgated Revenue Regulations No. V-3 (Exhibit D), published in 44 Off. Gaz. 1459-1461. Section 5 thereof provides:




It shall be the duty of every importer, manufacturer or producer, within twenty days after the end of every calendar quarter, to make a true and complete return of the amount of the gross sales during the preceding calendar quarter and pay the tax due thereon. (Sec. 183 (A), National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 253.) The amount paid in advance by importers, manufacturers and producers shall be credited against the percentage taxes due on their sales for each calendar quarter. (Sec. 183, ID.)




The percentage tax on business due from the petitioner during the second quarter of 1948 (April to June) was P177,058.26 payable within the first twenty days of July 1948. Within the first twenty days of July 1948 the petitioner paid the sum of P11,297.85 as advance percentage tax on goods or merchandise already imported and to be imported during the third quarter of 1948. When on 20 July 1948 the petitioner paid the percentage tax due for the second quarter, it considered and credited the sum of P11,297.85 as payment of the percentage tax on business due during the second quarter of 1948 (Exhibit 1) and did not claim any credit for the amount when it paid the percentage tax due for the third quarter (Exhibit 2). This the petitioner cannot do because the sum of P11,297.85 was paid in advance as percentage tax on goods or merchandise already imported and to be imported during the third quarter of 1948. consequently, the sum of P11,297.85 which was due for the second quarter of 1948 was not paid within the first twenty days of July 1948 as by law provided, and for that reason the surcharge of 25% of P2,844.46 was lawfully imposed. In other words the sum of P11, 297.85 paid in advance by the petitioner for goods or merchandise already imported and to be imported cannot be imputed to the percentage tax on business due for the second quarter of 1948, because such sum was paid in advance, as provided for in section 183 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 253, and not as a percentage tax on business, as provided for in section 183 (A) of the same Code, as amended.


The judgment under review is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.
