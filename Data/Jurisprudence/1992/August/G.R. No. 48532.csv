NOCON, 
J.:


Petitioners pray that his Court reverse the Decision of the public respondent Court of Tax Appeals, promulgated September 26, 1977
1
 denying petitioners' claim for tax refunds, and order the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to refund to them their income taxes which they claim to have been erroneously or illegally paid or collected.


As summarized by the Solicitor General, the facts of the cases are as follows:






Petitioners are Filipino citizens and employees of Procter and Gamble, Philippine Manufacturing Corporation, with offices at Sarmiento Building, Ayala Avenue, Makati, Rizal. Said corporation is a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble, a foreign corporation based in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A. During the years 1970 and 1971 petitioners were assigned, for certain periods, to other subsidiaries of Procter & Gamble, outside of the Philippines, during which petitioners were paid U.S. dollars as compensation for services in their foreign assignments. (Paragraphs III, Petitions for Review, C.T.A. Cases Nos. 2511 and 2594, Exhs. D, D-1 to D-19). When petitioners in C.T.A. Case No. 2511 filed their income tax returns for the year 1970, they computed the tax due by applying the dollar-to-peso conversion on the basis of the floating rate ordained under B.I.R. Ruling No. 70-027 dated May 14, 1970, as follows:






From January 1 to February 20, 1970 at the conversion rate of P3.90 to U.S. $1.00;


From February 21 to December 31, 1970 at the conversion rate of P6.25 to U.S. $1.00






Petitioners in C.T.A. Case No. 2594 likewise used the above conversion rate in converting their dollar income for 1971 to Philippine peso. However, on February 8, 1973 and October 8, 1973, petitioners in said cases filed with the office of the respondent Commissioner, amended income tax returns for the above-mentioned years, this time using the par value of the peso as prescribed in Section 48 of Republic Act No. 265 in relation to Section 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 265 in relation to Section 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 699 as the basis for converting their respective dollar income into Philippine pesos for purposes of computing and paying the corresponding income tax due from them. The aforesaid computation as shown in the amended income tax returns resulted in the alleged overpayments, refund and/or tax credit. Accordingly, claims for refund of said over-payments were filed with respondent Commissioner. Without awaiting the resolution of the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue on their claims, petitioners filed their petitioner for review in the above-mentioned cases.


Respondent Commissioner filed his Answer to petitioners' petition for review in C.T.A. Case No. 2511 on July 31, 1973, while his Answer in C.T.A. Case No. 2594 was filed on August 7, 1974.


Upon joint motion of the parties on the ground that these two cases involve common question of law and facts, that respondent Court of Tax Appeals heard the cases jointly. In its decision dated September 26, 1977, the respondent Court of Tax Appeals held that the proper conversion rate for the purpose of reporting and paying the Philippine income tax on the dollar earnings of petitioners are the rates prescribed under Revenue Memorandum Circulars Nos. 7-71 and 41-71. Accordingly, the claim for refund and/or tax credit of petitioners in the above-entitled cases was denied and the petitions for review dismissed, with costs against petitioners. Hence, this petition for review on 
certiorari
. 
2






Petitioners claim that public respondent Court of Tax Appeals erred in holding:


1.	That petitioners' dollar earnings are receipts derived from foreign exchange transactions.


2.	That the proper rate of conversion of petitioners' dollar earnings for tax purposes in the prevailing free market rate of exchange and not the par value of the peso; and


3.	That the use of the par value of the peso to convert petitioners' dollar earnings for tax purposes into Philippine pesos is ""unrealistic"" and, therefore, the prevailing free market rate should be the rate used.


Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on the other hand, refutes petitioners' claims as follows:






At the outset, it is submitted that the subject matter of these two cases are Philippine income tax for the calendar years 1970 (CTA Case No. 2511) and 1971 (CTA Case No. 2594) and, therefore, should be governed by the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code and its implementing rules and regulations, and not by the provisions of Central Bank Circular No. 42 dated May 21, 1953, as contended by petitioners.


Section 21 of the National Internal Revenue Code, before its amendment by Presidential Decrees Nos. 69 and 323 which took effect on January 1, 1973 and January 1, 1974, respectively, imposed a tax upon the taxable net income received during each taxable year from all sources by a citizen of the Philippines, whether residing here or abroad.


Petitioners are citizens of the Philippines temporarily residing abroad by virtue of their employment. Thus, in their tax returns for the period involved herein, they gave their legal residence/address as c/o Procter & Gamble PMC, Ayala Ave., Makati, Rizal (Annexes ""A"" to ""A-8"" and Annexes ""C"" to ""C-8"", Petition for Review, CTA Nos. 2511 and 2594).


Petitioners being subject to Philippine income tax, their dollar earnings should be converted into Philippine pesos in computing the income tax due therefrom, in accordance with the provisions of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 7-71 dated February 11, 1971 for 1970 income and Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 41-71 dated December 21, 1971 for 1971 income, which reiterated BIR Ruling No. 70-027 dated May 4, 1970, to wit:






For internal revenue tax purposes, the free marker rate of conversion (Revenue Circulars Nos. 7-71 and 41-71) should be applied in order to determine the true and correct value in Philippine pesos of the income of petitioners. 
3












After a careful examination of the records, the laws involved and the jurisprudence on the matter, We are inclined to agree with respondents Court of Tax Appeals and Commissioner of Internal Revenue and thus vote to deny the petition.


This basically an income tax case. For the proper resolution of these cases income may be defined as an amount of money coming to a person or corporation within a specified time, whether as payment for services, interest or profit from investment. Unless otherwise specified, it means cash or its equivalent. 
4


 Income can also be though of as flow of the fruits of one's labor. 
5


Petitioners are correct as to their claim that their dollar earnings are not receipts derived from foreign exchange transactions. For a foreign exchange transaction is simply that — a transaction in foreign exchange, foreign exchange being ""the conversion of an amount of money or currency of one country into an equivalent amount of money or currency of another."" 
6
 When petitioners were assigned to the foreign subsidiaries of Procter & Gamble, they were earning in their assigned nation's currency and were ALSO spending in said currency. There was no conversion, therefore, from one currency to another.


Public respondent Court of Tax Appeals did err when it concluded that the dollar incomes of petitioner fell under Section 2(f)(g) and (m) of C.B. Circular No. 42. 
7


The issue now is, what exchange rate should be used to determine the peso equivalent of the foreign earnings of petitioners for income tax purposes. Petitioners claim that since the dollar earnings do not fall within the classification of foreign exchange transactions, there occurred no actual inward remittances, and, therefore, they are not included in the coverage of Central Bank Circular No. 289 which provides for the specific instances when the par value of the peso shall 
not 
be the conversion rate used. They conclude that their earnings should be converted for income tax purposes using the par value of the Philippine peso.


Respondent Commissioner argues that CB Circular No. 289 speaks of receipts for export products, receipts of sale of foreign exchange or foreign borrowings and investments but not income tax. He also claims that he had to use the prevailing free market rate of exchange in these cases because of the need to ascertain the true and correct amount of income in Philippine peso of dollar earners for Philippine income tax purposes.


A careful reading of said CB Circular No. 289 
8
 shows that the subject matters involved therein are export products, invisibles, receipts of foreign exchange, foreign exchange payments, new foreign borrowing and 

investments — nothing by way of income tax payments. Thus, petitioners are in error by concluding that since C.B. Circular No. 289 does not apply to them, the par value of the peso should be the guiding rate used for income tax purposes.


The dollar earnings of petitioners are the fruits of their labors in the foreign subsidiaries of Procter & Gamble. It was a definite amount of money which came to them within a specified period of time of two yeas as payment for their services.


Section 21 of the National Internal Revenue Code, amended up to August 4, 1969, states as follows:






Sec. 21.	
Rates of tax on citizens or residents
. 
— 
A tax is hereby imposed upon the taxable net income received during each taxable year from all sources by every individual, whether a citizen of the Philippines residing therein or abroad or an alien residing in the Philippines, determined in accordance with the following schedule:


x x x           x x x          x x x






And in the implementation for the proper enforcement of the National Internal Revenue Code, Section 338 thereof empowers the Secretary of Finance to ""promulgate all needful rules and regulations"" to effectively enforce its provisions. 
9


Pursuant to this authority, Revenue Memorandum Circular Nos. 7-71 
10
 and 41-71 
11
 were issued to prescribed a uniform rate of exchange from US dollars to Philippine pesos for INTERNAL REVENUE TAX PURPOSES for the years 1970 and 1971, respectively. Said revenue circulars were a valid exercise of the authority given to the Secretary of Finance by the Legislature which enacted the Internal Revenue Code. And these are presumed to be a valid interpretation of said code until revoked by the Secretary of Finance himself. 
12


Petitioners argue that since there were no remittances and acceptances of their salaries and wages in US dollars into the Philippines, they are exempt from the coverage of such circulars. Petitioners forget that they are citizens of the Philippines, and their income, within or without, and in these cases wholly without, are subject to income tax. Sec. 21, NIRC, as amended, does not brook any exemption.


Since petitioners have already paid their 1970 and 1971 income taxes under the uniform rate of exchange prescribed under the aforestated Revenue Memorandum Circulars, there is no reason for respondent Commissioner to refund any taxes to petitioner as said Revenue Memorandum Circulars, being of long standing and not contrary to law, are valid. 
13


Although it has become a worn-out cliche, the fact still remains that ""taxes are the lifeblood of the government"" and one of the duties of a Filipino citizen is to pay his income tax.


WHEREFORE, the petitioners are denied for lack of merit. The dismissal by the respondent Court of Tax Appeals of petitioners' claims for tax refunds for the income tax period for 1970 and 1971 is AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioners.
