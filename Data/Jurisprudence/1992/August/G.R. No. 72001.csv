G.R. No. 72001	August 7, 1992


THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, 
plaintiff-appellee,

vs.


ROMEO BECHAYDA, 
accused-appellant.


The Solicitor General for plaintiff-appellee.


Dakila F. Castro & Asscociates for accused-appellant.




GUTIERREZ, JR
., J.:


The accused-appellant, claiming that reasonable
 
doubt exists in his favor, appeals the decision of the
 
Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City, Branch X dated
 
June 28, 1985 which convicted him of the crime of murder
 
instead of robbery with homicide after having discounted the crime of robbery for lack of sufficient proof. The
 
dispositive portion of the assailed judgment reads:






In view of the foregoing considerations
 
this Court is convinced beyond doubt of the
 
guilt of the accused of the crime of murder,
 
four (4) counts and for each of which the
 
accused is hereby sentenced to 
Reclusion Perpetua 
and to indemnify the heirs of the
 
four (4) victims the amount of P25,000.00
 
each as damages and to pay the costs. (RTC
 
Decision, p. 6; 
Rollo
, p. 21)






In Criminal Case No. 2719, the information which
 
charged the accused-appellant with robbery with homicide
 
alleges:






That on or about the 6th day of January,
 
1981, At about 8:00 o'clock P.M., at sitio
 
Dinanglayan, Barangay Buhatan, Municipality of
 
Rapu-Rapu, Province of Albay, Philippines,
 
above-named accused together with Rodolfo
 
Bilan and Rogelio Vergara who are still at
 
large, conspiring and confederating together
 
and mutually helping each other, with
 
treachery and evident premeditation, at
 
nighttime, taking advantage of superior
 
strength, with intent to kill, and with the
 
intent of gain, entered the dwelling of
 
Eleuterio Bilon and once inside, did then and
 
there wilfully and feloniously attack,
 
assault, hack and stab the occupants thereof,
 
namely: ELEUTERIO BILON, MARIA ESCASA, AURELIO
 
ESCASA and NORRIS MARQUEZ, inflicting upon
 
them mortal wounds which resulted to their
 
deaths, and thereafter above-named accused,
 
take, steal and carry away (
sic
) from said
 
dwelling cash money and other valuables in the
 
total sum of Two Thousand Pesos (P2,000.00),
 
Philippine Currency, owned and belonging to
 
said Eleuterio Bilon.


ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.


Legazpi City, July 29, 1983. (
Rollo
, p. 15)
 






Upon arraignment on August 29, 1983, a plea of not
 
guilty was entered by the accused-appellant with the
 
assistance of his counsel 
de parte
.


The Solicitor-General in his brief gives a vivid
 
picture of the antecedent facts of this case, 
to wit:






On the fateful day of January 6, 1981 at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon, Divina
 
Barcelon, a resident of Nagkaubas, Rapu-Rapu,
 
Albay, was on her way to the house of
 
Percivando Barcelon located in sitio Galicia
 
to buy fish when she passed by the house of a
 
certain Gomez. There she saw the appellant,
 
Rodolfo Bilon and Rogelio Vergara, who were
 
then armed with bolos, drinking gin. About
 
half an hour later, while she was returning
 
home, she again saw the trio in the said place
 
still drinking. (pp. 10-13, TSN, March 8,
 
1984)


At around 8:00 o'clock in the evening of
 
the same date, Jaime Bertis went to the house
 
of Eleuterio Bilon situated at sitio
 
Dinanglayan of the same municipality, to buy
 
cigarettes. (pp. 8-9, TSN, November 28, 1983) Upon reaching the place, he saw the same trio
 
having a drink in the kitchen of the house of
 
Eleuterio while the latter and the three (3)
 
other occupants of the house namely, Maria
 
Escasa, Norris Marquez and Aurelio Escasa,
 
were already sleeping. (pp. 10-12 TSN, 
Ibid.
)
 
The kitchen was lighted by the illumination of
 
the light coming from the sala. (p. 18, TSB,
 Ibid
). He heard Rodolfo telling his two (2)
 
companions that he would be the one to kill
 
first. (pp. 12-13, TSN, 
Ibid.
) Rodolfo
 
suddenly stood up and went straight near
 
Eleuterio, with the two (2) following him, and
 
with a bolo hacked Eleuterio while he was
 
sleeping. Frightened by the startling
 
incident, Jaime ran away from the place. As
 
he was running away from the place, he was met
 
by Miguel Avila who was then going to the
 
house of Eleuterio. He was asked by Miguel why
 
he was in a hurry but he did not bother to
 
answer because he was then so afraid that he
 
wanted to get away from the place as fast as
 
he could. (pp. 18-22 TSN, 
Ibid.
)


Miguel proceeded to the house of
 
Eleuterio to buy cigarettes. As he reached the
 
place, he stood right at the door which was
 
partly open and while he was peeping through
 
the door, he saw Eleuterio inside the house,
 
lying down with a wound an the neck. He also
 
saw Maria Escasa weeping while embracing the
 
right leg of the appellant who kicked her and,
 
as soon as she fell from such hold, fatally
 
wounded her with a bladed weapon. Norris
 
Marquez, a ten (10) year-old boy, woke up from
 
his sleep beside Maria and upon seeing her
 
condition, he embraced her but while thus
 
embracing Maria he was also hacked to death
 
by the appellant. Also awakened from sleep was
 
an old man named Aurelio Escasa who came out
 
of the bedroom and tried to find out what was
 
happening when he was suddenly stabbed on the
 
abdomen by Rodolfo (pp. 10-14, TSN; September
 
22, 1983)


As Miguel was about to leave the place, he
 
was seen by a person standing outside the
 
house who at once called on the appellant and
 
Rodolfo and informed them of Miguel's
 
presence. Confronted by the group, he
 
explained to them that he was there merely to
 
buy cigarettes and a bottle of gin. Miguel was
 
allowed to leave but with a warning not to
 
tell anybody whatever he may have seen,
 
otherwise, even members of his family would
 
also be killed. (pp. 14-15, TSN, 
Ibid
.)


As he was not able to sleep that night, Miguel went home to Legazpi City the following
 
day and remained silent about the incident.
 
But on January 8, 1981, or two (2) days after
 
the incident, when his conscience could no
 
longer bear it, Miguel sent a PLECS massage to
 
the Rapu-Rapu Police Station, thru the Legazpi
 
City Police Station, informing them of the
 
incident. He also disclosed the incident to
 
his wife that same day. (pp. 16-17, TSN,
 Ibid.
)


Earlier in the morning of said date, at
 
about 5:00 o'clock, Jaime Bertis went to the
 
house of Divina, a daughter of Eleuterio,
 
informed her about the incident and revealed
 
to her who were those responsible therefor.
 
(p. 35, TSN, October 17, 1983) Divina and her
 
group immediately proceeded to the house of
 
her father and when they arrived at the place,
 
the house was still closed with some people
 
around. A few moments later, some members of
 
the Civil Home Defense Force arrived and
 
opened the house. (pp. 40-42, TSN, 
Ibid
.)


Meanwhile Sgt. Rolando Victoria, the
 
Rapu-Rapu Police Station Commander, upon
 
receipt of the report about the incident,
 
organized a team of policemen. He dispatched
 
them to the place of the incident that same
 
day. He later followed them in the afternoon
 
and upon his arrival, he and his men conducted
 
their investigation. They found the bodies of
 
the victims in the house already in the state
 
of decomposition. They also took photographs
 
of the bodies of the victims. (pp. 12-16, TSN,
 
December 9, 1983)


Lourdes Balute, a daughter of Eleuterio,
 
was also at the scene of the incident that day
 
and noticed that the things in the house were
 
scattered and certain valuables such as wrist
 
watches, radio, cash, cigarettes, canned
 
goods, rice, and other grocery items were
 
missing. (pp. 4-5, TSN, 
Ibid.
) Upon the
 
request of the victim's relatives, Dr.
 
Erlandino Albaytar, the Municipal Health
 
Officer of Rapu-Rapu, Albay, conducted an
 
autopsy on the cadavers of the four (4)
 
victims and issued the corresponding autopsy
 
reports (Exhs. A, B, C and D) on the same
 
date. (p. 10, TSN, November 14, 1983)
 
(Appellee's Brief, pp. 3-7; 
Rollo
, p. 24)

The evidence for the defense which rests on alibi
 
and denial is summarized by the trial court as follows:






. . . that the accused and his companion, Roman
 
Bolante, were asked to work in the
 
construction of the house that Mancao, Rapu-
 
Rapu, Albay of Ruben Bechayda, the brother of
 
the accused Romeo Bechayda; that on the date
 
of the incident of January 6, 1981 the accused
 
was working on the house of his brother; that
 
he arrived at that place almost three days
 
before January 6, 1981; that he (the accused)
 
and his helper, Roman Bolante started working
 
there on January 6, 1981 at about 6:00 o'clock
 
in the morning continuously up to about 6:00
 
o'clock in the evening of the same day though
 
they took a break at noon for lunch; that they
 
never left that place during that period as
 
they were hurrying up to finish the
 
construction immediately; that after the day's
 
work, the accused took a rest and after eating
 
his supper he went to sleep; that he slept
 
with his brother, Ruben Bechayda; that the
 
accused knows the house of Eleuterio Bilon
 
which is situated at Dinanglayan, barangay
 
Buhatan, Rapu-Rapu, Albay; that Dinanglayan
 
can be reached by walking or by motor banca
 
from Mancao where he was working then on
 
January 6, 1981 in the house of his brother,
 
Ruben Bechayda; that it will only take more
 
than one (1) hour to walk at fast pace to
 
reach Dinanglayan from Mancao and only ten
 
(10) minutes by ""kumpit"" or motor banca; that
 
he denies knowledge of, much less admit
 
participation in the killings complained of;
 
that he knows personally Eleuterio Bilon being
 
the ""compadre"" of his father; that the accused
 
stayed at Mancao for two weeks and after that
 
he went home to Tabaco, Albay; that accused
 
was apprehended only sometime on June 12,
 
1983. (RTC Decision, p. 4; 
Rollo
, p. 20)






The trial court rejected the defense version
 
hence, its verdict of conviction is now before us. The accused-appellant in this appeal which was assigned to
 
this
 ponente
 on March 2, 1992 interposes the following
 
assignment of errors:






The lower court erred in:


I


GIVING CREDENCE AND RELYING ON THE
 
TESTIMONY OF THE TWO ALLEGED EYEWITNESSES
 
WHICH TESTIMONIES APPEAR INCONSISTENT WITH
 
OTHER EVIDENCE AND ARE CONTRARY TO HUMAN
 
EXPERIENCE.


II


CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR MURDER
 
ON FOUR COUNTS DESPITE UNCLEAR SHOWING OF
 
CONSPIRACY.


III


NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF
 
ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS CORROBORATED BY HIS
 
WITNESS. (Appellant's Brief, p. 6; 
Rollo
, p.
 
101)






Anent the first assigned error, the
 
accused-appellant contends that the testimonies of the two
 
eyewitnesses are replete with inconsistencies and defy
 
human experience. The testimonies which allegedly
 
appear inconsistent with the other evidence as pointed
 
out by the accused-appellant are as follows: (1)
 
prosecution eyewitness Miguel Avila testified on direct
 
examination that the accused-appellant hacked the victim
 
Maria Escasa on the leg while in cross examination the
 
same witness stated that the said victim was hit in the
 
neck (Appellant's Brief, p. 7); (2) prosecution
 
eyewitness Avila declared in open court that the young
 
boy Norris Marquez was hacker at the back while the
 
autopsy report which pertained to the said boy showed
 
that the cause of death was acute hypovolimia two
 
degrees hacked wound over the posterior portion of the
 
neck (
Ibid
. pp. 7-8); (3) according to prosecution
 
eyewitness Avila the deceased Maria Escasa was lying
 
down when hacked while according to another prosecution
 
witness Sgt. Rolando Victoria who conducted the
 
investigation in this case, Escasa was sitting on a mat
 
with her neck cut off on a bench (
Ibid
., p. 8); (4) in
 
his testimony, prosecution eyewitness Avila did not
 
mention having seen any blanket while the other
 
prosecution witness Sgt. Victoria described that both
 
Escasa and the boy Marquez were covered with a blanket;
 
and (5) according to another prosecution eyewitness
 
Jaime Bertis, he found the three assailants in this
 
case which included the accused-appellant drinking in
 
the kitchen of the slain Eleuterio Bilon while the
 
photograph exhibit of Bilon's kitchen during the
 
investigation contained only two opened bottles of beer
 
atop the kitchen table (
Ibid
., p. 10).


The above inconsistencies are inadequate to
 
overturn the positive and straightforward declarations
 
of the prosecution witnesses who recounted the tragic
 
and gruesome killings and who identified the accused-appellant as one of the authors. Hence, the accused-appellant must fail in his attempt to discredit the
 
prosecution eyewitnesses.


Besides, the alleged inconsistencies can be readily
 
dismissed for the following reasons:


(1)	the apparent discrepancy with reference to the
 
location of the hacked wound as regards the victim
 
Escasa in the testimonies of Avila on direct and cross-examinations is a mere oversight either on the part of
 
the court stenographer or the court interpreter inasmuch
 
as Avila used the word ""also"" in reference to the hacked
 
wound inflicted on Escasa. The use of the said word
 
strongly indicates that Escasa's hacked wound was
 
similarly located at the neck (not the leg) where
 
Bilon's wound was as previously related by Avila.
 
Thus, on direct examination he testified that:

Q	Now, please relate to this Court how

When I was right at the door I saw Eleuterio Bilon already having a wound by the neck

already fallen.

Alright. Put in on record.

interpretation).

embraced by Maria Escasa?


A	Right leg.


Q	What else did you see?


A	He kicked her and when she fell he hacked
 
her 
also 
on the leg.


Q	When you refer he you mean Romeo
 
Bechayda?


A	Yes, Romeo.


Q	When you mentioned her you refer to Maria
 
Escasa?


ATTY. BASE

COURT






Sustained.






Q	When you refer to Maria Escasa to whom
 
are you referring?


A	Maria Escasa, Your Honor. (Emphasis
 
supplied) (TSN, September 22, 1983, pp.
 
10-12);










(2)	there is no substantial difference between the
 
declaration made by Avila in court that Norris' hacked
 
wound was at the back and the autopsy report indicating
 
the hacked wound at the posterior portion of the neck as
 
both locate the mortal wound at the back portion of the
 
body with the autopsy report having been more specific
 
by its reference to the neck's posterior part;


(3)	the alleged discrepancy as regards Maria
 
Escasa's position when she expired bears no significance
 
inasmuch as the victim's body was in a supine position,
 i.e.
, lying down with her face upwards, and since her
 
head which was almost totally severed from her body as
 
per autopsy report was elevated on a bench, it is
 
understandable why another eyewitness would describe
 
Maria Escasa's position as ""sitting"" and not ""lying
 
down"";


(4)	the fact that prosecution eyewitness Avila
 
omitted mentioning the presence of a blanket when he
 
gave a picture of the crime scenario does not affect his
 
credibility considering that his omission pertained to
 
a very minor detail which jurisprudence regards as ineffective to taint one's credibility as a witness;
 
and


(5)	human experience shows that when one sees a
 
group gathered around a table with beer bottles on top
 
thereof, the said group, more often than not, would be
 
construed as having a drinking spree regardless of
 
whether one or two of them would actually not be
 
drinking beer, thus, prosecution eyewitness Bertis did
 
not commit any serious error in stating that he found
 
the accused-appellant and two assailants in this case
 
drinking in the kitchen of the slain Bilon when only two
 
bottles of beer were captured in the photograph exhibit.


Once again, we rule that:






. . . The averred inconsistency in the
 
testimony of the prosecution witness on minor
 
details reinforces rather than weaken his
 
credibility for it is usual that witnesses to
 
a stirring event should see differently some
 
details of a startling occurrence. This has
 
been taken judicial notice of by the Court.
 
(People v. Obando, et al., 182 SCRA 95 [1990]). Discrepancies in minor details are
 
to be expected from an uncoached witness,
 
(People v. Noguerras, 181 SCRA 19 [1990]) and
 
will not impair the veracity of the evidence.
 
(People v. Manalansan, 189 SCRA 6l9 [1990]).
 
(See People v. Puloc, 202 SCRA 179; 189-190
 
[1991])






With respect to the testimonies that allegedly defy
 
human experience, the accused-appellant argues that the
 
following circumstances are not credible for being
 
contrary to human experience: (1) prosecution witness
 
Avila works in Galicia, Rapu-Rapu making abaca strips;
 
on the day of the killings in question, he testified
 
that he worked all day in Galicia but he went to
 
Dinanglayan, Rapu-Rapu in the evening to buy cigarettes
 
(Appellants Brief, p. 7); (2) Avila was the son-in-law
 
of the victim Eleuterio Bilon, yet, he did not inform
 
anyone including his wife about the killings he had witnessed until two (2) days had elapsed after the
 
incident (
Ibid
, p. 9); (3) Avila declared in court
 
that he was only asked by the accused-appellant and one
 
Rodolfo Bilon where he was going when they saw him at
 
the crime scene and he was merely warned not to tell any
 
body what he saw when normally perpetrators of heinous
 
crimes do not spare material witnesses thereto (
Ibid
);
 
(4) prosecution witness Bertis, in his testimony in
 
court described that a Coleman lamp illuminated the sala
 
where the victims Maria Escasa, Eleuterio Bilon and
 
Norris Marquez were sleeping while the kitchen where
 
alleged assailants were drinking was not (
Ibid
., p. 10);
 
(5) Bertis' declarations that the four occupants of the
 
place where the killings transpired remained asleep
 
while the accused-appellant and his two other
 
companions were drinking and talking therein and that
 
the hacking of the deceased Eleuterio Bilon while on
 
supine position which could have produced a thudding
 
sound did not awaken the three other occupants of the
 
house do not conform to the normal standards of human
 
behavior (
Ibid
., pp. 10-11); and (6) Divina Barcelon,
 
daughter of the victim Eleuterio Bilon, averred that
 
both (Avila and Bertis were contracted to strip abaca on
 
Eleuterio's land at the time of the incident in
 
question; being close relatives, it was not natural for
 
them to flee from Dinanglayan and remain silent about
 
the killings if, indeed, they witnessed the same (
Ibid
.,
 
p. 11).


We are not persuaded by the accused-appellant's
 
suppositions.


The trial court has weighed the evidence and has
 
ruled on the issue of credibility in favor of the
 
prosecution. There are no cogent reasons for us to
 
reverse the findings effected and the conclusions
 
reached by the trial court. Hence:






The oft-repeated aphorism that the appellate court will not disturb the factual findings of the trial court especially as to credibility of witnesses, as the latter is in a better position to decide said question, having heard the witnesses themselves and having observed their demeanor and manner of testifying during the trial, unless it has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered might affect the result of the case (People v. Adones, 144 SCRA 364 [1986]; People v. Patog, 144 SCRA 429 [1986]; People v. Veloso, 148 SCRA 60 [1987]; People v. Acelajado, 148 SCRA 142 [1987]; People v. Alcid, 135 SCRA 280 [1985]; People v. Lopez, 132 SCRA 188 [1984] deserves reiteration (People v. Joselito Villalobos, et al., G.R. No. 71526, May 27, 1992; see also People v. Rafael Acuram, G.R. Nos. 98423-24, May 22, 1992 citing People v. Lati, 184 SCRA 336 [1990] and People v. Payumo, 187 SCRA 64 [1990]).






On the alleged failure of the prosecution's eyewitnesses to immediately report the killings in question, it is a fact of life that each person is so unique that different people register a variety of reactions when subjected to the same types of situations. (See People v. Biago, 182 SCRA 411 [1990], citing People v. Niebres, 178 SCRA 114[1989]). Moreover, it is a matter of judicial notice that there is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted by a shocking occurrence like the hacking incident in the instant case which even included a four-year old boy and an eight-one year old man to whom marked sympathy is generally afforded on account of the former's very tender age and the latter's far advanced age. (see People v. Ponce, 197 SCRA 746 [1991]) citing People v. Salufrania, 159 SCRA 401 [1988]).


As regards the second assigned error, the accused-appellant impugns the holding made by the trial court
 
that conspiracy exists in the case at bar.


We see no error in the trial court's finding that
 
conspiracy is present. As submitted by the Solicitor
 
General in his brief, conspiracy as shown by the
 
prosecution evidence is indicated from the following
 
circumstances, 
to wit
:






a)	Few hours before the incident,
 
appellant and his two (2) companions were seen
 
by Divina Barcelon in the house of a certain
 
Gomez drinking gin while armed with bolos;


b)	Eyewitness Bertis saw the same trio
 
in the kitchen of Eleuterio drinking and
 
shortly afterwards, Bertis overheard Rodolfo
 
Bilon telling the group that he would be the
 
one to kill first;


c)	When Rodolfo Belan stood up and went
 
near Eleuterio who was sleeping in the sala,
 
appellant and Rogelio Vergara followed him;


d)	After Rodolfo hacked Eleuterio with
 
a bolo, the appellant in turn fatally wounded
 
Maria and Norris;


e)	When Avila's presence at the scene
 
of the incident was discovered by the third
 
companion of the appellant, the latter and
 
Rodolfo came out and confronted Avila. The
 
trio even warned Avila not to tell anyone what
 
he may have witnessed, otherwise, even members
 
of his family would also be killed.
 
(Appellee's Brief, p. 17)






As we have held in the case of 
People v. Lorenzo, et al
., (200 SCRA 201, 217 [1991]):






. . . To prove conspiracy, the prosecution need not establish that all the parties thereto agreed to every detail in the execution of the crime or that they were actually together at all the stages of the conspiracy. It is enough that, from the individual acts of each accused, it may reasonably be deduced that they had a common plan to commit the felony (People v. Caitor, et al., 137 SCRA 761 [1985])


Consequently, there is conspiracy as the
 
evidence by the prosecution clearly indicates that the acts and behavior of the accused
 
reveal their common purpose to assault and
 
inflict harm upon the deceased and that there
 
was a concerted execution of that common
 
purpose (People v. Batas, et al., 176 SCRA 46 [1989].






With respect to the third assigned error, the
 
accused-appellant insists that he was already sleeping
 
with his brother, Ruben Bechayda, at the latter's house
 
in Mancao, Rapu-Rapu Albay, when the incident occurred.
 
Considering that the accused-appellant was positively
 
identified by the prosecution eyewitnesses as one of the
 
assailants responsible for the slaying of the four
 
victims in this case, the defense of alibi becomes
 
futile for it is a settled rule that such defense cannot
 
prevail over the positive identification of the accused
 
by the prosecution eyewitness against whom no motive to
 
falsely, testify against the accused can be established.
 
(People v. Francisco C. Ventura, G.R. No. 90015, April 10, 1992; People v. Pedro Canciller y Balua, G.R. No.
 
97296, March 4, 1992; People v. Desiderio Salazar y
 
Dacanay, et al., G.R. No. 88665, January 23, 1992).


Moreover, our pronouncement in the case of 
People vs. Carlos Villanueva
 (G.R. No. 94133, May 8, 1992) bears reiteration:






. . . it is important to stress that
 
courts always receive with caution, if not
 
suspicion, evidence of alibi, not only because
 
it is inherently weak and unreliable, but also
 
because of its easy fabrication. To overcome
 
the evidence of the prosecution, an alibi, must satisfy the test of full, clear, and
 
satisfactory evidence. This test requires not
 
only proof that the accused was somewhere else
 
other than the scene of the crime, but clear
 
and convincing proof of physical impossibility
 
for him to have been at the place of the
 
commission of the crime. (People v. Baring,
 
187 SCRA 629 [1990] citing People v. Gaddi y Catubay, 170 SCRA 649 [1990]).






According to the accused-appellant in his direct
 
testimony, in order that one can cover the distance
 
between Mancao (where he had been allegedly sleeping at
 
the time of the incident in question) and Sitio
 
Dinanglayan (where the crime under consideration
 
occurred) by walking, it will take more than an hour but
 
by ""kumpit"" or motorized banca, it will only take about
 
ten to twenty minutes (TSN, August 10, 1984, pp. 7-8).
 
Thus, right from the horse's mouth, as the old adage
 
goes, the element of physical impossibility is wanting
 
in this case. Besides, the accused-appellant did not
 
present his brother Ruben in court to bolster his claim
 
that he was sleeping in Ruben's house and in the company
 
of Ruben himself. Hence, the defense on alibi becomes
 
unavailing.


Finally, we are in accord with the trial court's
 
findings that save for evident premeditation, the
 
aggravating circumstances of treachery, nighttime and
 
taking advantage of superior strength are present in
 
this case and that treachery absorbs both nighttime and
 
taking advantage of superior strength in the light of
 
the circumstances of the case at bar (see People v.
 
Pacris, 194 SCRA 654 [1991] citing People v. Ramillano,
 
133 SCRA 201 [1984] and People v. Rosario, 134 SCRA 496
 
[1985]). Considering that treachery qualifies the
 
killing of the four victims in this case, the accused-appellant is guilty of four counts of murder, in the
 
absence of proof to sustain a conviction for robbery
 
with homicide as charged in the information.


WHEREFORE IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the appealed
 
decision dated June 28, 1985 is hereby AFFIRMED with the
 
MODIFICATION that the amount of indemnification to the
 
heirs of the four (4) victims is increased to FIFTY
 
THOUSAND PESOS P50,000.00 each pursuant to prevailing
 
jurisprudence.


SO ORDERED.
