That on August 1, 1983 at 12:30 in the morning she was in their house at 30 Cuatro de Julio, Galas, Quezon City. With her then were her sons Antonio, Rodrigo and Jose and they were lying down on their stall-like house in the squatter's area. That while asleep in their house, she heard their house being stoned and looked out and saw Jimmy, Arturo and Rosemarie;
 
that she peeped thru the window and saw Jimmy Caranzo, saying ""Boyet Lumabas ka magtuos tayo."" ""Boyet"" refers to her son the victim, Antonio Eugenio Jr.; that she tried to prevent her son from going out and the ply-wood door was forced open and Jimmy Caranzo entered their house together with Arturo de Vera and Rosemarie; that Jaime Caranzo immediately stabbed his son on the left portion of the breast with a solid stainless (
sic
) about one foot long;
 
that Arturo de Vera also stabbed her son hitting his right chest; that Rosemarie was holding a piece of wood, about 1 1/2 to 2 feet in length;


That her son was able to flee and went outside their house and ran towards Bayani Street; that the three followed him (Antonio) and she also followed; that she saw her son fall on a culvert (embornal) at Bayani Street and then Arturo de Vera stabbed him again and Rosemarie Balignasay was saying ""Sige, saksakin pa at patayin na ninyo"";
 
that she identified all the three (3) accused in open Court; that she and her son Michael did not go near the culvert as they were afraid and later chased by the accused and they hid in a dark place at Cuatro de Julio and corner Liberation St. which is ""seeing distance"" from the culvert where her son fell; that when she felt that the assailants
 
were gone she
 
sought the assistance of the police. With the
 
police, she went to the scene of the crime but
 
her son was already brought to the hospital; the owner of the house fronting the street (culvert) informed her that her son was
 
brought to Mt. Banawe Hospital; that she and
 
her son Michelle (
sic
) went to Mt. Banawe
 
Hospital, but she was informed that her son

She likewise testified that before the
 
incident, her son confessed to her that Arturo
 
de Vera threatened to kill her son because de
 
Vera wants to own Rosemarie Balignasay; that she was told by her son also that Jaime
 
Caranzo threatened to kill him because of a
 
case of robbery-hold-up where complainant
 
pointed to Jaime Caranzo instead of her son,
 
as the culprit.

his house; that Rosemarie Balignasay was at

that
 
Balignasay

Wilfredo Caranzo

(
Rollo
, pp. 30-32)






Of the three who were convicted, only Jaime Caranzo and Rosemarie Balignasay filed their notices of appeal (Records, p. 363 and p. 378 respectively). Although, both notices of appeal were filed with the Court of Appeals, the records of the case with regards to Balignasay were forwarded to the Supreme Court as the penalty meted out as to her case was 
reclusion perpetua. 
(Article VIII, Section 5 (2) (d), Constitution) There is nothing in the records to show what became of Jaime Caranzo's appeal to the Court of Appeals. Balignasay is, then, the only appellant in this case.


She raises the following assignment of error in her appeal, to wit;






I


THE HON. TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT ARTURO DE VERA HAD NO MOTIVE TO KILL ANTONIO L. EUGENIO, JR. THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH MOTIVE IN ARTURO DE VERA IS ESSENTIAL IN DECIDING WHETHER ROSEMARIE BALIGNASAY IS GUILTY OF CONSPIRING WITH HIM TO KILL ANTONIO EUGENIO, JR., FOR THE EVIDENCE OF SUCH ALLEGED CONSPIRACY BEING 
CIRCUMSTANCIAL, MOTIVE 
NOT ONLY IS IMPORTANT, BUT 
IS CONTROLLING.


II


THE HON. TRAIL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT ANTONIO EUGENIO, JR.'S ONLY FATAL WOUND ON HIS RIGHT CHEST, MEASURING 1.9 BY 0.5 CMS. AND 8 CM. DEEP WHICH PASSED THROUGHT THE 2ND INTERCOSTAL SPACE AND LACERATED THE RIGHT LUNG'S UPPER LOBE, WAS INFLICTED INSIDE ANTONIO EUGENIO, JR.'S HOUSE IN 4 DE JULIO STREET, AS CLAIMED BY HIS MOTHER; AND NOT IN CORNER BAYANI AND SAN ISIDRO STREETS, AS CLAIMED BY ARTURO DE VERA.


THE TESTIMONY (
SIC
) SUCH WOUND WAS INFLICTED AT NO. 304 DE JULIO IS LEGALLY INCREDIBLE, FOR CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF SUCH WOUND, RAPID –– IF NOT INSTANT –– DEATH COULD HAVE RESULTED, OR AT LEAST THE VICTIM WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY WEAKENED AND COLLAPSED: (1) DUE TO THE LUNG BEING PENETRATED BY THE BLADE OF THE WEAPON; (2) DUE TO PNEUMOTHORAX, OR ENTRY OF AIR BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE CHEST AND THE LUNG; AND (3) DUE TO MASSIVE HEMORRHAGE, WHICH COULD BE THE RESULT OF LARGE BLOOD VESSELS BEING CUT OR SEVERED. IT IS THUS IMPROBABLE (
SIC
) ANTONIO EUGENIO, JR. AFTER RECEIVING SUCH WOUND, COULD HAVE RUN 4 BLOCK AWAY FROM HIS TO HOUSE IN 4 DE JULIO STREET TOWARDS LUZON AVENUE; THEN TO SAN ISIDRO STREET AND FROM THERE TO CORNER SAN ISIDRO AND BAYANI STREETS.


III


SINCE ANTONIO EUGENIO, JR.'S ONLY FATAL WOUND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN INFLICTED ON HIM INSIDE HIS HOUSE AT 4 DE JULIO STREET, THEN THE HON. TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT SUSTAINING THE DEFENSE TESTIMONIES THAT WHILE ARTURO DE VERA AND ROSEMARIE BALIGNASAY WERE WALKING ALONG 4 DE JULIO STREET, ANTONIO EUGENIO, JR. SUDDENLY APPEARED FROM A DARK CORNER, STABBED AT BUT MISSED ARTURO DE VERA, WHO RAN BUT WAS CHASED BY ANTONIO EUGENIO, JR. STARTING AT 4 DE JULIO STREET, THEN LUZON AVENUE, THEN SAN ISIDRO STREET, THEN AT CORNER SAN ISIDRO AND BAYANI STREETS, WHERE ARTURO DE VERA WAS CORNERED; AND WHERE AFTER A STRUGGLE FOR POSSESSION OF A KNIFE THEN HELD BY ANTONIO EUGENIO, JR., ARTURO DE VERA FINALLY GOT POSSESSION OF SUCH KNIFE WITH WHICH HE STABBED MANY TIMES ANTONIO EUGENIO, JR., INFLICTING
 
ON HIM SEVERAL WOUNDS, INCLUDING THE LONE FATAL WOUND ON HIS RIGHT CHEST, WHICH RESULTED IN RAPID, IF NOT INSTANT, DEATH OR, AT LEAST, IN
 
THE VICTIM IMMEDIATELY WEAKENING AND COLLAPSING.


IV


THE HON. TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE EVIDENCE OF ALLEGED CONSPIRACY ON WHICH ROSEMARIE BALIGNASAY'S CONVICTION IS BASED, WAS PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. FOR SUCH EVIDENCE, WHICH IS 
CIRCUMSTANTIAL,
 NOT ONLY IS 
INHERENTLY WEAK,
 BUT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESUMPTION OF ROSEMARIE BALIGNASAY'S INNOCENCE. SHE MUST HENCE BE ACQUITTED AND
 
BE DISCHARGED.(
Rollo
, p. 126-127)






The only question that needs to be answered in deciding whether the appellant is innocent or guilty of parricide in whether or not conspiracy exists in the instant case.


It is well-settled in our jurisprudence that when there is conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all, and all persons taking part in the crime shall be held guilty as principals. It is of no moment that the appellant did not take
 
part in the actual commission of every act constituting the crime. She is responsible for all the acts of the others done in the furtherance of the conspiracy. (See People v. Maranion, 199 SCRA 421, 433 [1991] citing
 
People v. Obando, 182 SCRA 95 [1990]; and People v. Quinones, 183 SCRA 747 [1990])


In the case at bar, the appellant in her four assignments of errors asserts that there is no conspiracy. She maintains that the version of the prosecution showing the existence of conspiracy is not credible.


The appellant states that the prosecution's version has several flaws. First,
 
Cristina's testimony that the victim ran four (4) blocks (should be three (3) blocks [TSN, March 27, 1985, p. 7]) is not true since the victim could not have run those four blocks after receiving the fatal wound inside Cristina's house since he would have died immediately or would have at once weakened and collapsed. Second, Cristina failed to mention in her statement (Exhibit
 
""N""), given two (2) days after the stabbing, the fact that Balignasay was holding a 1 1/2 to 2 feet piece of wood and that Balignasay shouted ""sige saksakin pa at patayin"" which was included in her open court testimony. (TSN, April 25, 1984, p. 11-12) The only thing she mentioned in her statement as to Balignasay's participation is that she was with the two other
 
accused. Third, Michael whom Cristina mentioned was with her during the time of the stabbing, did not mention Balignasay in his statement (Exhibit
 
""O"") at all. Fourth, Cristina had motive to testify against Balignasay due to Balignasay's unfaithfulness to her son. Because
 
of the flaws just mentioned, the
 
appellant contends that the version of the defense denying the conspiracy is then, more credible.


The contention is without
 
merit. The
 
alleged flaws are justifiable.


As to the fact that the victim could not have run four (4) (three (3) according to Cristina's testimony) blocks after receiving the fatal stab wound, there is no showing in the
 
medico legal report and the testimony of Dr. Gajardo, the medico-legal examiner, to support the theory of the appellant. In fact, the appellant's theory on instantaneous death runs counter to Dr. Gajardo's testimony that the victim could have been saved if timely medical assistance was given. (See TSN, July 31, 1984, p. 4)


As to the second and third flaws, suffice it to say that affidavits being taken 
ex parte 
usually are incomplete and often inaccurate, caused sometimes from partial suggestions, sometimes for want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected collateral circumstances necessary for the correction of the first suggestion of his memory and for his accurate recollection of all that belongs to the subject. (People v. Urquia, G.R. No. 94787, November 19, 1991) The statement given by Cristina placed the appellant at the scene of the crime. It was in her testimony in open court that she expounded on Balignasay's participation.


As to the supposed motive of Cristina to falsely testify against the appellant, there is no showing in the records by clear and
 
convincing evidence (see People v. Urquia, 
supra
) that she has carried a grudge against the appellant because of the estrangement between her son and the appellant. Nowhere in her more than 100-paged testimony did she malign or bad-mouth Balignasay. Her testimony rings true because she could have testified that the appellant had a hand in the stabbing of her son yet she did not. There was also no reason to include Caranzo as one of the accused if she was just bent on seeking revenge on the appellant and her lover. Furthermore, in the span of almost two (2) years that her son and the appellant were separated, there is no mention of any altercation between herself and the appellant even though they had every opportunity to cross paths and to exchange heated words.


The appellant's defense, however, did not stop there. She contends that assuming that Cristina Eugenio's testimony is true, the two circumstances that she was holding a 1 1/2 to 2 feet long piece of wood while the victim was being stabbed and that she was shouting ""Sige, saksakin at patayin"" while the victim was being stabbed again are not sufficient to establish conspiracy.


While it is the true that a finding of criminal conspiracy must be supported by evidence constituting proof beyond reasonable doubt, it is equally true that such evidence need not be direct evidence. (People v. Gabatin, G.R. No. 84730, October 28, 1991) It may be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated. The conditions attending its commission and the act executed may be indicative of the common design to accomplish a criminal purpose and objective. If there is a chain of circumstances to the effect, then, conspiracy has been establish. (People v. Arroyo, 201 SCRA 616, 629 [1991])


Conspiracy has been established beyond reasonable doubt. Aside from the two circumstances that the appellant mentioned above, we agree with the Solicitor General that the following additional circumstances show the existence of conspiracy: (1) Arturo de Vera and Rosemarie Balignasay were living together as husband and wife after the latter separated from the victim Antonio Eugenio, Jr.; (2) both Arturo and Rosemarie were with Jaime Caranzo when the latter shouted at the victim to come out of his house and fight; (3) Forthwith, the trio, armed with knives and piece of wood, forcibly opened the ply-wood door of the victim's house; and once inside, Arturo and Jaime started to stab the victim, while Rosemarie stood by the door and beat the victim with the piece of wood she was holding when the latter passed thru the door to flee; (4) The three chased the victim until the latter fell into a culvert along Bayani Street, where he was stabbed repeatedly by Arturo and Jaime in the presence of Rosemarie who exhorted them to continue on stabbing the victim; (5) Thereafter, the trio left together, leaving behind the victim who was mortally wounded; and, (6) The victim sustained no less than fifteen (15) wounds of different nature, indicating that they were inflicted by more than one assailant.


These circumstances show the unity of criminal purpose.


In view of the foregoing, the assertion of the appellant in her first assigned error that motive is a controlling factor to establish conspiracy in this case must fail.


Whether motive exists is not essential in the case at bar. This Court has time and again ruled that lack of motive does not preclude conviction when the crime and the participation of the accused therein are definitely established. (People v. Ballinas, G.R. No. 93300, October 4, 1991)


The appellant was placed at the scene of the crime and her actions before, during and after the incident indubitably show her participation in the crime committed.


The proper penalty, however, to be imposed should only be
 reclusion perpetua 
and not life imprisonment or
 reclusion perpetua
 as the trial court rendered. It is the oft-repeated rule that in a judgment of conviction for a felony, the court should specify the appropriate name of the penalty inasmuch as under the scheme of penalties in the Revised Penal Code, the principal penalty for a felony has its own specific duration and corresponding accessory penalties (See People v. Aquino, 186 SCRA 851, 863 [1990]). There is no penalty of life imprisonment in the scheme of penalties under the Revised Penal Code (People v. Samillano, G.R. No. 62088, March 6, 1992).


The actual damages should be P3,980.00 as per Exhibits ""J"", ""K"", ""K-3"", ""L"", and ""M"". The death indemnity is increased to P50,000.00. The P50,000.00 moral damages is deleted.


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED with the above modifications.


SO ORDERED.


Feliciano, Bidin, Davide, Jr. and Romero, JJ., concur.
