This is an appeal from the decision dated September 8, 1989 of the Regional Trial Court of Masbate, Masbate, Fifth Judicial Region, Branch 44 
1
 in Criminal Case No. 5205 finding accused-appellant Ramonito Gelotin,

Let a warrant for their arrest be issued for their apprehension.


SO ORDERED.

Earlier, on March 16, 1987, Ramonito Gelotin 
alias 
''Kumander Putol,"" Gerry Aliman, and two John Does were charged with kidnapping before the said trial court in an information that reads:






That on or about August 16, 1985, in the afternoon thereof, at Barangay Mapuyo, Municipality of Mobo, Province of Masbate, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Court, the said accused who are private individuals confederating together and helping one another, being then transients of said place armed with guns did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously kidnap one Romeo Marcos, permanently separating the latter from his dwelling, detained him from the date of the commission up to the present time depriving him of his personal liberty. 
3








It appears, however, that only Ramonito Gelotin was arraigned, while the other three accused, namely: Gerry Aliman and the two John Does, were not. Gelotin entered a plea of ""not guilty"" upon his arraignment on June 16, 1987. 
4




The facts are well-stated in the People's Brief and they are as follows:






On August 16, 1985, at around 5 o'clock in the afternoon, while Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos; her sons, Raquel and Ruel; and a certain David Marcos, were in their house in Mapuyo, Mobo, Masbate, five armed men suddenly arrived (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 3; June 16, 1987, pp. 2-3). Of the five armed men, two were identified as herein accused Ramonito Gelotin 
alias 
""Kumander Putol"" and a certain Jerry Aliman 
alias 
Baludoy (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 3; July 28, 1988, p. 3). Ramonito Gelotin had a very distinguishable mark: his left arm was amputated (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 13).


The armed men were looking for Romeo Marcos, husband of Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 3; July 28, 1988, p. 3). Romeo Marcos was in the fields plowing the land, so Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos ordered her son, Raquel, to go and fetch him (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 3; June 16, 1987, p. 3). Raquel Marcos did as he was told (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 3; June 16, 1987, p. 3).


When Romeo Marcos reached their house, the herein accused Gelotin ordered him to go near the unidentified armed men (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 3). One of the armed men, at gunpoint, ordered Romeo Marcos to lie, face down, on the ground (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 4; July 28, 1988, p. 4). They then bound his hands at his back and hit him with the butt of their guns (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 41; July 28, 1988, p. 4). Meanwhile, Ramonito Gelotin ordered another to search their house for firearms, but they found nothing (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 4).


Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos and her sons sat beside each other, around five meters sway from where her husband was, helplessly watching. (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 5). When asked as to why they were tying up Romeo Marcos, Ramonito Gelotin replied that it was because he was an informer of the military (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 5).


Raquel Marcos was also hogtied (Exhibits ""A"" and ""B"", pp. 3-6, Records).


Thereafter, at around 6 o'clock in the evening, they made Romeo Marcos stand up, hit him in his back, and made him walk towards the mountains of Barag (TSN, July 28, 1988, pp. 4-5; June 16, 1987, pp. 5-6).


That was the last time Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos saw her husband (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 7).


Two days after her husband was taken, Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos proceeded to the Detachment Command of the Philippine Constabulary in Mapuyo, Mobo, Masbate for assistance (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 6; December 14, 1988, p. 2). She informed them that ""Kumander Putol,"" Gerry Aliman, Baludoy, and two others, who she believed were member of the ""Walang Patawad"" group, kidnapped her husband (TSN, June 16, 1987, 12-14; December 14, 1988, p. 2).


A team of Philippine Constabulary soldiers was immediately dispatched to look for Romeo Marcos and his kidnappers (TSN, July 28, 1988, pp. 5-6; June 16, 1987, p. 7). The search, however, yielded negative results (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 6; June 16, 1987, p. 7).


On or about December 1986, Ramonito Gelotin surrendered to the authorities (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 8). The surrender was broadcast over the local radios of Masbate (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 10). When Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos and Raquel Marcos heard the radio broadcast, they immediately proceeded to the headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary to ascertain whether the surrender was the same person who kidnapped Romeo Marcos (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 10; June 16, 1987, p. 14).


When the accused was presented to them, they immediately recognized him as one of the persons who kidnapped Romeo Marcos (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 10; June 16, 1987, p. 15). He was immediately identified because of his distinct physical appearance, his amputated left arm (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 13).


A complaint for kidnapping was then filed. 
5






Accused-appellant is now before Us to seek, naturally, favorable appellate action. He raises the sole issue of whether or not the prosecution was able to establish positively and beyond doubt, his identity as one of the perpetrators of the kidnapping.


We find no merit in his appeal.


Indeed, there can be no doubt that the appellant was one of the kidnappers of the unfortunate victim, Romeo Marcos. This fact is sufficiently established by the convincing testimonies of Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos and Raquel Marcos, wife and son, respectively of Romeo Marcos. Both of them positively identified, not only once but twice, Ramonito Gelotin as one of the kidnappers—first, when accused-appellant came down from the mountains to surrender at the PC Headquarters in Masbate, Masbate, 
6
 and second, in open court. 
7
 Both likewise testified to the fact that accused-appellant has a very peculiar physical characteristic, which is, his left arm was amputated, 
8
 hence the name by which he was notoriously known: ""Kumander Putol"".


Here, lumped together, are the following crucial testimonies of Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos and Raquel Marcos:

(p. 20, Appellee's Brief)










Verily, the foregoing evidence for the prosecution, clearly established, without question, the identity and guilt of herein accused-appellant for as the Solicitor General put it very well, ""(e)vidently, the complainant witnesses had enough time to study the faces of their beloved Romeo Marcos' captors. The incident being a very harrowing and traumatic experience, it is beyond all question that the faces of the abductors left a very lasting imprimatur on the recesses of the complainants' memory, 
14
 hence, ""the complaining witnesses Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos and Raquel Marcos could not have erred in identifying the appellant as one of the kidnappers. 
15


Necessarily then, the trial court correctly arrived at a judgment of conviction when it brushed aside, as unworthy in evidence, appellant's alibi

that he was in another island at the time of the kidnapping. 
16
 It need only be stressed that in this jurisdiction, the unbending rule to which our Courts have long and faithfully adhered to is that alibi cannot prevail in the light of the positive identification of the accused.


As to that part of the decision appealed from sentencing appellant to pay damages in the sum of P30,000.00 to the heirs of the late Romeo Marcos, the same should be understood as damages for the Kidnapping and not for the victim's death for it is to be noted that the crime with which appellant was charged, and later convicted of, at the trial court was Kidnapping only. 
17


ACCORDINGLY, the decision appealed from, as clarified above, is hereby AFFIRMED, with costs against accused-appellant.


SO ORDERED.
