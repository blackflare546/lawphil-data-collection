JUDGE JOSE B. GATICALES, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, KABANKALAN, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, 
respondents.


R E S O L U T I O N




PER CURIAM:
p


This administrative matter refers to the charges of gross misconduct brought by the Office of the Court Administrator against Judge Jose Gaticales of the Municipal Trial Court of Kabankalan, Negros Occidental.


The antecedent facts are as follows:


In a letter dated April 16, 1991, a certain Anna Marie Lopez (her pseudonym) charged the respondent for abusive, unethical, indecent and corrupt practices. After looking closely at the matter, this Court, in its resolution dated April 23, 1991, directed the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) to file a verified complaint against the respondent and asked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate Lopez' allegations.


Acting pursuant to our resolution, the OCA charged the respondent with gross misconduct for: (1) extracting money from litigants; (2) demanding ""lagay"" before issuing warrants of arrest; (3) charging exorbitant fees for marriage licenses; (4) immoral advances against a lady litigant and (5) being a heavy drinker and smoker. As a result of the NBI investigation, sufficient evidence to support a
 prima facie
 case on the first four charges was ascertained. The report of the NBI and its annexes were referred to Executive Judge Layumas to whom this Court referred the case for evaluation and recommendation.


Executive Judge Layumas, then, set the case for hearing. The following witnesses testified against the respondent:

Upon hearing the evidence for and against the respondent, Executive Judge Layumas has the following conclusions:






xxx			xxx			xxx


. . . the respondent Judge Jose B. Gaticales is GUILTY of Gross Misconduct as charged, by committing the following acts:


1.	getting some articles on credit from the store of Virgilio Wee, a litigant in his sala, without paying for the same in spite of the lapse of more than two (2) years since he signed the vale for said goods;


2.	extracting the amount of Three Thousand (P3,000.00) Pesos from Virgilio Wee, a litigant in his sala;


3.	misbehaving before a crowd of more than Seven Thousand (7,000) people, who are members of the NOCECO during a general assembly meeting, with high ranking national and local leaders present during said meeting, by talking with the use of a microphone in a manner that he could not be understood for he was under the influence of liquor, and throwing the microphone to the ground to the dishonor of the Judiciary;


4.	withholding the amount of Three Hundred (P300.00) Pesos from the cash bonds of Gonzalo Voluntate and asking for another twenty (P20.00) pesos from the Voluntate couple.


The other charges of:


a)	demanding ""lagay"" before issuing warrants of arrests;


b)	charging exhorbitant fees for marriage licenses;


c)	immoral advances against a lady litigant;


d)	being a heavy smoker;


are recommended for dismissal for insufficiency of evidence. (Judge Layumas' report, pp. 30-31,33)






The Executive Judge recommended a two-year suspension without pay for the respondent Judge. Furthermore, the Executive Judge stated that once reinstated, the respondent be transferred to another court as he will not be an effective dispenser of justice in Kabankalan because of the petition (Exhibit ""10"") signed by many citizens of that municipality asking for his dismissal.


This Court agrees with the above findings of the Executive Judge. However, we find that the recommended penalty is too light for the acts of gross misconduct committed by the respondent. The correct penalty should be dismissal.


The Executive Judge found the testimonies of Virgilio Wee and Lilia Voluntate to be credible. He stated that the giving of the P3,000 by Virgilio Wee to the respondent had something to do with the delay in the execution of the respondent's decision against Wee. (Judge Layumas' report, p. 220) As with regards to Lilia Voluntate's charges, the respondent merely denied said charges. He did not even subpoena the treasurer of Kabankalan to testify that he had nothing to do with the withdrawal of the cash bonds. (Judge Layumas' report, p. 25)


These acts of the respondent show that he can be influenced by monetary considerations. These acts of the respondent of demanding and receiving money from a party-litigant before his court constitute serious misconduct in office. It is this kind of gross and flaunting misconduct, no matter how nominal the amount involved, on the part of those who are charged with the responsibility of administering the law and rendering justice that so quickly and surely corrodes the respect for law and the courts without which government cannot continue and that tears apart the very bonds of our polity. (Haw Tay v. Singayao, 154 SCRA 107, 111-112 [1987])


Such acts go against Canons 2 and 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct which state: A Judge should 
avoid impropriety
 and the appearance of impropriety 
in all activities
 and a judge should perform official duties 
honestly
, and with impartiality and diligence (emphasis supplied).


In the case of 
Mejia v. Pamaran
, 160 SCRA 457, 477 [1988], we held that:






Those who are involved in the administration of justice from the highest to the lowest level must live up to the strictest standard of honesty and integrity in the public service. The general public should respect and support such imperative. No attempt to influence them one way or the other much less to bribe them should be made. One cannot buy a bad case nor sell a good one. No amount of money can make out a good case out of a bad one. And even if one succeeds in so doing it would certainly be uncovered and reversed on appeal. Justice will prevail.






Although the other charges of extracting money from litigants (as to the charges of Noble and Engojo) were not proven for lack of witnesses willing to stand up in public against a Judge, this Court is just as concerned about the poor reputation that Judge Gaticales has developed in Kabankalan. A Judge anywhere should be the last person to be perceived as no better than a mulcting traffic cop or a corrupt bureaucrat out to make money at every turn. The reputation of the respondent unfortunately appears to have preceded him, and while situations are possible where a judge is unfairly ruined by well-orchestrated attempts of disgruntled litigants or power blocs or influential members of the community whose interests are threatened by a judge's zeal and integrity, no evidence has been shown in this case that the mounting complaints against the Judge are the byproducts of similar maneuvers. At any rate, the thing itself has spoken, and it has spoken eloquently. (Office of the Court Administrator v. Bartolome, Adm. Matter No. RTJ-90-446, November 7, 1991)


The respondent ruined his reputation by misbehaving in front of a crowd of more than 7,000 people. After a lapse of more than 2 years, he has not paid his P324.00 debt to Virgilio Wee. Only during the hearing did the respondent offer to pay for it.


All these acts of the respondent constitute gross misconduct that deserves a penalty of dismissal.


WHEREFORE, Judge Jose Gaticales, is hereby DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all salaries, benefits and leave credits to which he may be entitled. Copies of the decision are furnished the Secretary of Justice and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for possible prosecution and disbarment proceedings. The dismissal is with prejudice to re-employment in the Government service, including government-owned or controlled corporations.


SO ORDERED.
