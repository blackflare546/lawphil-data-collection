A.M. No. P-89-312	January 9, 1992


CONCHITA LIM-ARCE, 
complainant,

vs.


ALEJANDRO S. ARCE, Deputy Sheriff, and CARMEN A. BARBASA, Staff Assistant I, Regional Trial Court, Tacloban City, 
respondents.




R E S O L U T I O N






PER CURIAM:


The instant case arose from a sworn letter-complaint filed by Conchita Lim-Arce, and received by the Office of the Court Administrator on April 21, 1989, against her husband Alejandro S. Arce and Carmen A. Barbasa, both employed as a Deputy Sheriff and Staff Assistant 1, respectively, at the Regional Trial Court, 8th Judicial Region, Government Center, Palo, Leyte, for immorality allegedly committed as follows:






Complainant, who is the wife of respondent Arce, alleged that sometime in July 1988, while she was searching for their camera in the aparador in their house, she accidentally discovered several letters, telegrams, pictures, etc. neatly placed underneath the paper cover of the drawer which has always been locked but happened to be opened (
sic
) that day. The letters and telegrams were all addressed to respondent Arce and allegedly written by respondent Barbasa who therein intimately call (
sic
) herself ""Mama"" and complainant's husband as ""Papa.""


Complainant informs that in an effort to hide their true identity in some of their communications, respondents use their respective maternal surnames.


After the discovery, complainant confronted respondent Arce who then promised to stop his illicit relations with respondent Barbasa. Despite this promise, however, respondent Arce continued his illicit affair. This allegedly affected complainant physically and mentally, causing her eventual confinement in a hospital.


According to complainant, after her hospitalization, she found her children staying with her relatives and no longer in their conjugal home because her husband had maltreated them. Her husband also announced openly to his family that he was not leaving his mistress since they were having a harmonious relationship.


Complainant further alleges that in one occasion, she went to the court premises to get her husband's pay check upon his order and while there, complainant saw respondent Barbasa in the library and she looked at her from a distance. When complainant's husband arrived home that day, he accused complainant of putting respondent Barbasa to great shame, and when complainant denied the accusation, respondent Arce allegedly boxed her. 
1






It appears, however, that respondent Arce filed an application for his early retirement under Republic Act No. 6683 and which was approved by the Court 
En Banc 
in its resolution dated April 20, 1989. 
2
 Upon the recommendation of then Court Administrator Meynardo A. Tiro, 
3


 the Court dismissed the complaint for being moot and academic in its resolution dated July 4, 1990, it appearing that respondent had already retired from the service on April 20, 1989, with the approval of the Court, and that the complaint was filed on April 21, 1989. 
4




Complainant thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal alleging that although the retirement of respondent Arce has mooted the administrative complaint against him, the same is not true as to respondent Barbasa who is still in the service as Staff Assistant I at the Regional Trial Court Library at Palo, Leyte, hence the case as against her should proceed. 
5


Pursuant to the memorandum report of the Office of the Court Administrator, 
6
 this Court issued a resolution on December 12, 1990 
7
 which set aside the resolution of July 4, 1990 which dismissed the complaint for being moot and academic, and referred the case to Executive Judge Pedro S. Espina of the Regional Trial Court of Tacloban City for investigation, report and recommendation.


Executive Judge Espina submitted this Final Report dated June 25, 

1991, 
8
 with the following findings:






The alleged illicit relationship was discovered (in the) month of July, 1988, when the complainant accidentally found letters, telegrams and cards in his cabinet. The wife confronted husband Alejandro Arce, who impliedly admitted his relationship with co-respondent Carmen Barbasa and promised the wife that he will gradually end the relationship. With the assurance, she withheld the filing of a formal complaint. Without her knowledge, Sheriff Arce filed his optional retirement, without giving her and the family any part for their support and left the conjugal home. He permanently lives now with respondent Carmen Barbasa at Barangay Pawing, Palo, Leyte.


During the investigation Carmen Barbasa was confronted with the letters, cards and telegrams. She admitted some as written or sent by her while denying others. Those letters and cards are below quoted and Carmen Barbasa's comment.

Respondent admitted the letter was her handwriting and the ""Papa"" referred to, is co-respondent Alejandro Arce.

Dear Papa,






How are you? Although it's not proper for a girl to make the first move, I had to do it, after 3x times of taking chances to see you. Why are you doing this. You lied to me. You are not even worth for a trust and confidence. I should not have given you such value.


We are not kids, We should stick to principles, if you have that.


If you have time, I want to have a little talk with you. If busy with someone nice and new, just ignore my wish and forget everything.


Remember that we are in Court, even if I'm already a sore to your eyes, I'm entitled to a day in Court.






Why a sudden change. What have I done?






























Mama


























P.S.	I shall hate you for this and I can't forgive you until my death. I can't forget this incident, happening between us. I am really very sad, why you are treating me like these. I made a mistake why I came back. I don't need plastic. What I need is real. Bring everything that belongs to me. Why are you doing this to me? Where did I made (

Mama






























Respondent admitted she sent the card but says she picked the card without the intention of conveying such endearing message.






On the basis of the foregoing, Executive Judge Espina found that sufficient evidence exist to prove that respondents are guilty of immorality and thereby recommended the dismissal of respondent Barbasa, with the exception of respondent Arce who had since then retired from the service. The Executive Judge hastens to add 
9
 that ""(t)his extreme penalty (of dismissal) could have been tempered if she severed her relationship from Arce by way of demonstrating desistance after realizing that she may destroy a family. On the contrary, she aggravated the situation. Whereas before, she would only rendezvous for a tryst surreptitiously, she now lives with him openly under one roof. This is established with credible evidence that the legal wife discovered as appearing in her supplemental affidavit 
10
 and photographs. 
11


On July 31, 1991, the Court referred the matter to the Office of the 

Court Administrator for re-evaluation, report and recommendation. 
12
 In a memorandum submitted by Deputy Court Administrator Juanito A. Bernad, dated October 29, 1991, respondent Barbasa was recommended for dismissal from the service with forfeiture of all retirement privileges and with prejudice to reinstatement in the national and local governments, as well as in any instrumentality or agency including government-owned or controlled corporations. It is pointed out therein that the documentary evidence cannot but yield the conclusion that an illicit relationship existed between respondents since 1984; that respondent Barbasa's letters to her co-respondent are in the nature of endearing messages addressed to a lover and not, as she pretends, to a respected elder or friend; and that she now lives with her co-respondent in Paway, Palo, Leyte. 
13


The deputy court administrator likewise opines that ""(a)lthough respondent Arce is also guilty of immorality, it is unfortunate that the proper penalty cannot be imposed upon him, for he has already retired from the service and has collected his retirement benefits. Hence, the case against him is now moot and academic."" 
14


There is no iota of doubt, on the basis of the evidence presented, that respondents Arce and Barbasa are guilty of the detestable acts complained of.


Time and again we have stressed adherence to the principle that public office is a public trust. All government officials and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives. This constitutional mandate should always be in the minds of all public servants to guide them in their actions during their entire tenure in the government service. 
15
 The good of the service and the degree of morality which every official and employee in the public service must observe, if respect and confidence are to be maintained by the Government in the enforcement of the law, demand that no untoward conduct on his part, affecting morality, integrity and efficiency while holding office should be left without proper and commensurate sanction, all attendant circumstances taken into account. 
16


The exacting standards of ethics and morality imposed upon court employees and judges are reflective of the premium placed on the image of the courts of justice. In the words of Justice Cecilia Muñoz Palma:






The image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the least and lowest of its personnel — hence, it becomes the imperative sacred duty of each and everyone in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a true temple of justice. 
17






Under Section 36 of Presidential Decree No. 817, which provided for the organization of the Civil Service Commission, and Memorandum Circular No. 30, Series of 1989 of the Civil Service Commission, disgraceful and immoral conduct is punishable by dismissal.


WHEREFORE, respondent CARMEN A. BARBASA, is hereby ordered DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and with prejudice to reinstatement in the national and local governments, as well as in any governmental instrumentality or agency including government-owned or controlled corporations. This resolution is immediately executory. Let a copy of this resolution be entered in the personal records of respondents.


Narvasa, C.J., Melencio-Herrera, Gutierrez, Jr., Cruz, Paras, Feliciano, Padilla, Bidin, Griño-Aquino, Medialdea, Regalado, Davide Jr. and Romero, JJ., concur.
