vs.


THE COURT OF APPEALS and FELIPA SAJULGA, 
respondents.


 


NOCON, 
J.:


Petitioner Bienvenido Ocier questions the respondent Court's decision, promulgated October 29, 1990, 
1
 
which affirmed the trial court's decision of June 4, 1990,
2
 which ordered him to vacate private respondent's landholding when he has constantly demanded that his case be referred first to the Ministry (now Department) of Agrarian Reform for certification as to whether or not the case is proper for trial pursuant to PD 316 and its implementing rules and guidelines.


As found by the respondent court, the antecedent facts of the case are as follows:




On May 2, 1986, the appellee filed a complaint for ejectment and collection of rentals with damages. It is alleged 
inter alia
 that the appellee is the absolute owner of a parcel of agricultural land located at Managok, Malaybalay, Bukidnon, containing an area of seven (7) hectares, more or less and more particularly described in paragraph 2 of the complaint; that in the later part of May, 1964, appellee leased three (3) hectares of said land to appellant at an agreed rental of 22 cavans (45 kilos per cavan) of clean palay per hectare each year; that appellant since April, 1982 up to November 3, 1985 has failed to pay the full rental resulting in his delinquency amounting to 3,992 kilos which valued at P3.00 per kilo amounts to P11,766.00; that on December 14, 1985, appellant sub-leased one (1) hectare of the said leased land to Nicolas Juralan for P5,000.


It is prayed, among others, that appellant be ordered to pay the accrued rentals, to vacate the area occupied by him under the leasehold agreement, to pay moral damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses.


In the Answer, appellant denied the material allegations of the complaint but admitted that he was a tenant of the appellee since he was a tenant of the appellee since he was still single in 1956 until he got married in 1968 and prior to 1970, the parties observed sharing arrangements of 70-30% in favor of tenant-appellant and thereafter observed the leasehold system. Appellant set up the affirmative defenses that the appellee has no cause of action against appellant who by law is obliged to pay rentals except during crop damage due to national calamity or fortuitous events; and that this case arose out of a leasehold or tenancy relationship which is designed to tenancy relationship which is designed to harass or eject the tenant farmer and necessitates referral to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform for certification as to whether or not the case is proper for trial pursuant to P.D. 316 and its implementing rules and guidelines.


On November 18, 1986, the appellant filed a motion to refer the case to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform pursuant to P.D. 316. Opposing the aforesaid motion, appellee invoked the provisions of P.D. 816.


On March 16, 1987, the appellant filed a motion for leave to amend complaint, attaching thereto the Amended Complaint, which sought rescission in addition to the reliefs prayed for in the original complaint (basing her cause of action not on the Code of Agrarian Reforms but on the New Civil Code).


In the Order of July 23, 1987, the trial court granted the motion for leave to amend the complaint, and admitted the Amended Complaint.


On December 2, 1987, appellant filed his Amended Answer with Counterclaim dated November 26, 1987, reiterating his affirmative defense that the subject land being devoted to rice and the appellant being an agricultural lessee therein, the case should first be referred to the Department of Agrarian Reform pursuant to Decree Nos . 316 and 946. 
3






After due trial, the trial court rendered its judgment, applying the provisions of Article 1659 of the New Civil Code, as follows:


xxx			xxx			xxx


Having subleased the land to another person without the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff-lessor, defendant violated a clear prohibition provided for under the New Civil Code. Said law provides:




The lessee cannot assign the lease without the consent of the lessor, unless there is a stipulation to the contrary.




Because of the foregoing, plaintiff has the right to rescind the contract of lease she had with the defendant thus:




If the lessor or the lessee should not comply with the obligations set forth in articles 1654 and 1657, the aggreived party may ask for the rescission of the contract and indemnification for damages, or only the latter, allowing the contract to remain in force.




xxx			xxx			xxx


In review of the foregoing, judgement is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff and against the defendant resciding the lessee relationship between them; ordering the defendant to vacant the property in question not later than 30 days from receipt of this judgement; to pay rental amount of P8,000.00, attorney's fee of P3,000.00 and litigation expenses of P83.00.

On appeal, the respondent court, however, ruled as follows:




At the outset, We would like to make clear what law should apply to the case at bar. It is the agrarian laws, for agricultural tenancy exists in the instant case. Agricultural tenancy as defined in Section 3, Republic Act 1169, as amended by Republic Act 3844, is the physical possession by a person of land devoted to agriculture belonging to and/or legally possessed by another for the purpose of production through the labor of the farmer and of the members of his immediate farm household, in consideration of which the farmer agrees to share the harvest with the latter, or to pay a price certain or ascertainable either in produce or in money or in both. The land tenanted by the appellant may still be considered public land, but since the appellee claims ownership thereof and is the legal possessor of the same, by virtue of which she entered into a leasehold contract of tenancy with the appellant, their relationship shall be governed by the agrarian laws then in force.


Coming to the contention of appellant that the trial court could not proceed to try the case where the instant case should have been first referred to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform for determination. We hold that Presidential Decrees Nos. 316 and 946 are not applicable. Such referral is not necessary where the tenancy relationship between the parties is admitted in the pleadings. . . .


xxx			xxx			xxx


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.

Before this Court, petitioner now submits to Us for our consideration the following points:




1.	The Regional Trial Court did not acquire jurisdiction over the instant case in not referring the same to the Department of Agrarian Reform;


2.	The Court of Appeals did not correctly apply P.D. 816 when it decided to oust the tenant-farmer for being remiss in the payment of amortization;


3.	The Court of Appeals did not apply the proper evidentiary rule to the case at bar.
6




Petitioner, citing Section 2, P.D. 316 and Sections 2 and 3, P.D. 583, claims that the referral to the Secretary of Agrarian Reform in ejectment cases involving tenant-farmers is mandatory as it tips the balance of justice in favor of the lowly-tenant farmers.
7
 
And under P.D. 816, petitioner claims that what is being punished is the continuing and deliberate refusal to pay leasehold rentals which is not applicable to petitioner as there was tungro and rat infestation during the two-year period when he was unable to pay.
8
 
Lastly, petitioner claims that the respondent court did not apply the proper evidentiary rules to his case as it is the private respondent who had the burden to show by clear, positive and convincing evidence that he (petitioner) refused deliberately to pay his rentals considering that this is an ejectment case involving a tenant
. 9


Private respondent counters that petitioner deliberately refused to pay his leasehold rentals when he was able to make a harvest — inspite of the tungro and rat infestation — but did not share it to buy land elsewhere for agricultural purposes.
10
 Petitioner also subleased one hectare of the land in question to one Nicolas Juralan violating Section 27(2) of R.A. 3844 — which is an additional ground for his ejectment.
11
 Since the landlord-tenant relationship of the parties is admitted, private respondent claims that referral to the Secretary of Agrarian Reform is no longer needed. 
12


Considering that both the respondent court and the trial court decided on petitioner's ejectment from the disputed landholding but for different mutually exclusive reasons — the respondent court with its agrarian tenancy view of the case while the trial court with its civil law lease view of the case, this court has painstakingly reviewed the records of the case to come up with a decision in accordance with law and jurisprudence considering the allegation of petitioner that he is an agricultural tenant of private respondent.


It is already settled that the essential requisites set by law for the existence of a tenancy relationship are: (1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant; (2) the subject is agricultural land; (3) the purpose is agricultural production; and (4) there is consideration. It is also understood that (5) there is consent to the tenant to work on the land, that (6) there is personal cultivation by him and that the consideration consists of sharing the harvest. 
13
 
And with respect to the landowner, We have ruled that tenancy relationship can be created only with the consent of the true and lawful landowner.
14


Although private respondent claims to be the landowner 
15
 
of the landholding involved, petitioner presented in the lower court his witness, one Mrs. Renelda Galapati, who testified 
16
 
that it is the ""insular (should be ""national"") government"" which owns the disputed landholding, through the Bukidnon Agricultural College, and presented as part of his evidence a ""Summary List of Rice and Corn Land,"" 
17
 
prepared by said Mrs. Galapati in her capacity as Agrarian Reform Technologist of the Department of Agrarian Reform, showing that the disputed landholding was still under investigation by the Department of Agrarian Reform as it was ""still under the Insular Government there is no title given to individual owners yet."" 
18
 In fact, it was petitioner's affidavit stating in essence the above, 
19
 in his motion to refer the case of the Department of Agrarian Reform, which prompted 
20
 private respondent to seek leave of court to amend her complaint changing her cause of action from the violation of agrarian law theory to the violation of civil law lease theory.


It seems that what We have before Us is the scenario where petitioner has been cultivating a patrimonial property of the State since 1956. He did not know it because private respondent did not tell him so. Apparently, private respondent was supposed to personally cultivate the disputed landholding as there is testimony 
21
 
and evidence 
22
 
to the effect that she and her late husband were given the disputed landholding to cultivate as part of their school training as agricultural graduates of Bukidnon Agricultural College. Instead, she hired petitioner to do so.


It is not the duty of the Court to determine findings of fact based on these different pieces of evidence; it is the trial court's duty to do so. 
23
 
Private respondent's sudden shift in cause of action should have alerted the trial court as to her real status as landowner. The trial court should have determined whether the disputed landholding is still part of Bukidnon Agricultural College. If yes, then the same is patrimonial property of the State which is subject to disposition pursuant to Art. No. 3038. 
24
 
The Trial court should also have determined what was the nature of the assignment by Bukidnon Agricultural College to private respondent. Was it under Act No. 3038? If so, applying Sections 51(4) 
25
 
and 66, 
26
 
RA 3844, as amended, in relation to P.D. 152, 
27
 
then petitioner has the preferential right to acquire the land actually tilled by him.


It is the State's policy that the actual tiller of the land shall own the land he tills. 
28
 In accordance with this Sate policy, We have no other choice but to order that this case be sent to the Agrarian Reform Adjusdication Board 
29
 
to make the necessary findings of fact so that the abovementioned State policy will be faithfully complied with.


Our discussion is not based on any of the assigned errors in the 
Rollo
 before Us, but it has evolved from an exhaustive review of all of the facts of the case. It is already settled that the Court, with its broad powers, can rule on unassigned errors as long as these will enable it to arrive at a just solution of the conflict before the Court.
30


But even without the preceding discussion, the Court still finds for petitioner.


Private respondent, in her original complaint before the lower court, alleged that petitioner violated the Land Reform Code and could be ejected under P.D. 816. Petitioner answered that he was a tenant of private respondent. There was, at that point in time, no need of referral to the Department of Agrarian Reform as the landowner-tenant relationship was admitted. 
31


However, when private respondent's amended complaint — where she alleged violation of a civil law lease agreement — was admitted, the issue

of actual tenancy — raised by petitioner in both his Answer and Amended Answer — had to be referred to the Department of Agrarian Reform for determination as this was now a genuine issue. 
32


This is very clear from P.D. 1038, which reinforced P.D. 316, 
33
 
in its Sections 2 and 3, which read as follows:




Sec. 2.	No Judge of the Courts of Agrarian Relations, Courts of First Instance, City or Municipal Courts, or any other tribunal or Fiscal shall take cognizance of any ejectment case or any other case designed to harass or remove a tenant of an agricultural land primarily devoted to rice and/or corn, unless certified by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform as a proper case for trial or hearing by a Court of Judge or other officer of competent jurisdiction and, if any such case is filed, the case shall first be referred to the Secretary of Agrarian Reform or his authorized representative in the locality for a preliminary determination of the relationship between the contending parties. If the Secretary of Agrarian Reform or his authorized representative in the locality finds that the case is a proper case for the Court or Judge or other hearing officer to hear, he shall so certify and such Court, Judge or other hearing officers may assume jurisdiction over the dispute or controversy.


The preliminary determination of the relationship between the contending parties by the Secretary to Agrarian Reform, or his authorized representative, is not binding upon the Court, Judge or hearing officer to whom the case is certified may, after due hearing, conform, reverse or modify said preliminary determination, as the evidence and substantial merits of the case may warrant.


Sec. 3.	All cases still pending before any court, Fiscal or other investigating body which are nor yet submitted for decision or resolution shall likewise be referred to the Department of Agrarian Reform for certification as provided in the preceding section.




The trial court did not therefore have any jurisdiction to entertain the amended complaint by private respondent in the lower court and it was grave abuse of discretion on the part of the respondent court to affirm the lower court's jurisdiction in the face of the very clear mandate of the pertinent laws as abovecited. There is no need, therefore, to discuss the other assigned errors.


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED. The questioned October 29, 1990 decision of the respondent court is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The amended complaint of the private respondent in the court 
a quo
 is hereby ordered to be TRANSFERRED to the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board for disposition in accordance with the evidence and the law.


SO ORDERED.
