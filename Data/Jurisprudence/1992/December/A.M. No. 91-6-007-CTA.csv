GUTIERREZ, JR., 
J.:


In his letter-request dated May 21, 1991, Court of Tax Appeals Presiding Judge Alex Z. Reyes asks that, for purposes of his compulsory retirement from judicial service under R.A. No. 910, the last step increment of his salary grade be used in the computation of his retirement pay and terminal leave benefits.


Judge Reyes was appointed Associate Judge of the Court of Tax Appeals on July 31, 1980, and served as such until November 20, 1990. Beginning November 21, 1990 until his retirement on November 24, 1991, he served as Presiding Judge of said court.


In his request, Judge Reyes cites the Position Allocation List and a salary schedule (Approved Salary Standardization), both issued by the Department of Budget and Management.


The Position Allocation List, which took effect on July 1, 1989, was issued by the Department of Budget and Management pursuant to Section 6 of R.A. 6758, otherwise known as the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989, which provides:






SEC. 6

 — All positions in the government covered under Section 4 hereof shall be allocated to their proper position titles and salary grades in accordance with the Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades of the Compensation and Position Classification System which shall be prepared by the DBM.






Under the Position Allocation List, the position of Presiding Judge of the Court of Tax Appeals is allocated salary grade 30, with the salary rate of P227,700 per annum, or P18,975 monthly. Judge Reyes was receiving such amount at the time of his retirement.


The salary schedule cited by Judge Reyes provides the following for salary grade 30:
