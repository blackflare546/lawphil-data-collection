petitioner,


vs.


COMMISSIONER ON AUDIT, and MARTHA ROXANA T. CABURIAN, 
respondents.


 


CAMPOS, JR. 
J.:


This petition for 
certiorari
 with Preliminary Injunction seeks to annul and set aside the Decision of the respondent Commissioner on Audit (hereinafter referred to as the Commission), dated February 5, 1991 which denied due course to the appeal of petitioner from the disallowance by Regional Auditor Martha Roxana Caburian of petitioner's claim for transportation allowance for the period covering the month of January 1989 in the amount of P1,250.00.


Petitioner is the Regional Legal Counsel of the National Power Corporation (NPC) for the Northern Luzon Regional Center covering the provinces of Rizal up to Batanes. As such he was issued a government vehicle with plate number SCC 387. Pursuant to NPC policy as reflected in the Board Resolution No. 81-95 authorizing the monthly disbursement of transportation allowance, the petitioner, in addition to the use of government vehicle, claimed his transportation allowance for the month of January 1989. On May 31, 1990, the petitioner received an Auditor's Notice to Person Liable dated April 17, 1990 from respondent Regional Auditor Martha Roxana Caburian disallowing P1,250.00 representing aforesaid transportation allowance.


In a letter to the said Regional Auditor dated June 18, 1990, the petitioner moved for reconsideration of the disallowance of the claim for transportation allowance. The Regional Auditor denied petitioner's motion in a letter dated June 27, 1990. Petitioner appealed this denial to the Commission on Audit at Quezon City, which denied do due course.


Hence this petition.


The issue to be resolved is whether such denial to give due course to the appeal of herein petitioner constitutes grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.


Grave abuse of discretion implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, or in other words where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.

It is beyond dispute that the discretion exercised in the denial of the appeal is within the power of the Commission on Audit as it is provided in the Constitution:






Sec. 2.	The Commission on Audit shall have the following powers and functions:






(1)	Examine, audit, and settle, in accordance with law and regulations, and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned or held in trust by, or pertaining to, the Government, or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations; keep the general accounts of the Government and, for such period vouchers pertaining thereto; and promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations including those for the prevention of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant expenditures or uses of funds and property. . . . (Article XII-D, 1973 Constitution)
2










In the exercise of such power it promulgated COA Circular No. 75-6 dated November 7, 1975, regulating the use of government motor vehicles, aircrafts and watercrafts, which, among others, provides:






VI.	Prohibition Against Use of Government Vehicles by Officials provided with transportation allowance ––


No official which has been furnished motor transportation allowance by any government corporations or other office shall be allowed to use mother vehicle transportation operated and maintained from funds appropriated in the abovecited Decree. (Sec. 14, P.D. 733)






The petitioner takes exception from the coverage of said circular contending that such circular did not mention the NPC as one of the corporations/offices covered by it. We do not agree with him for it is very patent that the circular is addressed, among others, to managing heads of Government-owned or Controlled Corporations, the NPC being held under such category of corporations. Petitioner goes on to argue that existing NPC policy grants transportation allowance to employees in the likes of petitioner. Under the NPC Charter, R.A. 6395, petitioner contends that the NPC has the power to formulate and adopt policies and measures for the management and operation of the NPC.

Pursuant thereto, NPC passed Resolution No. 81-95 dated April 20, 1981 authorizing the monthly reimbursement of representation and transportation allowance. This was implemented by Circular 81-11 dated April 22, 1988. He then contends that the COA Circular Nos. 7506 and 75-6A should be limited in their application to the NPC.


We likewise cannot sustain petitioner's contention that the Commission, in the exercise of its power granted by the Constitution, usurped the statutory functions of the NPC Board of Directors for its leads to the absurd conclusion that a mere Board of Directors of a government-owned and controlled corporation, by issuing a resolution, can put to naught a constitutional provision which has been ratified by the majority of the Filipino people. If We will not sustain the Commission's power and duty to examine, audit and settle accounts pertaining to this particular expenditures or use of funds and property, owned or held in trust by this government-owned and controlled corporation, the NPC, We will be rendering inutile this Constitutional Body which has been tasked to be vigilant and conscientious in safeguarding the proper use of the government's, and ultimately, the people's property.


The factual finding of the Commission that petitioner was indeed assigned a government, vehicle is conclusive upon this Court. The petitioner faults respondent Regional Auditor for relying on her serious doubts as to the nature of the use of the vehicle assigned to petitioner as basis for the disallowance. We hold, however, that such issue is immaterial in the case at bar for the COA circular, in prohibiting the use of motor vehicles by officials receiving transportation allowance, is categorical. The use of government motor vehicle and the claim for transportation allowance are mutually exclusive. It is on this basis that the P1,250.00 transportation allowance was disallowed.


Construed in the light of the applicable law and rules on the matter, the decision of the Commissioner on Audit disallowing the petitioner's claim for transportation allowance does not indicate a grave abuse of discretion which will warrant setting aside and nullifying the said COA ruling.


WHEREOF, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. With costs against the petitioner.


SO ORDERED.


Narvasa, C.J., Gutierrez, Jr., Cruz, Feliciano, Padilla, Bidin, Griño-Aquino, Regalado, Davide, Jr., Romero, Nocon, Bellosillo, and Melo, JJ., concur.
