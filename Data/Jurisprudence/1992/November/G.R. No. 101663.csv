On the other hand, the version of the defense is summarized by the trial court as follows:






ERIC TIMTIMAN Y FULGADO in grief testified as follows: That he is a student of Tanay National High School in Tanay, Rizal, free from tuition fees. That on September 5, 1990 at about 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon, he was in the Midway Restaurant, Sitio Burol, Barangay Tandang Kutyo, Tanay, Rizal. That he was in the restaurant to request for the advice of his uncle of his plan to elope with one Angelita San Juan. That he arrived at the Midway Restaurant together with his uncle Renato Concepcion, Angelita San Juan was already there waiting for them. That when they arrived at the restaurant at about 11:30 in the morning Angelita San Juan was sitting facing the door at a table near the window, which was about 2 arms length away. That there were about four tables inside the Midway Restaurant, and two of the tables were occupied. That they sat at the table and talked with Angelita San Juan. That at about 1:00 o'clock of the same day two persons made a mistake about (pinagkamalan po ako) him and thought that he was with the two persons which they were apprehending. That at that time, the two other tables inside the restaurant were occupied, each by 3 and two persons who were drinking soft drinks and beers, respectively. That with the two persons who made a mistake about him, one came from the outside of the restaurant while the other at a table near the door. That one of the said persons held his hand and arrested him, but did not say anything. That after his apprehension, he was loaded by the two in a tricycle and brought him to the 222nd PC INP Co., Baras, Rizal. That prior to this date, he has never been charged of any crime as attested to in his Barangay clearance, both dated April 1, 1990. That he came to know later that the two persons who apprehended him were Norberto Macaraeg and Nonato Esquilon.


RENATO CONCEPCION in brief testified as follows: That on September 5, 1990 between the hours of 11:00 and 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon he was with his nephew Eric Timtiman in the Midway Beer House and Restaurant in Tanay, Rizal. That he was with Eric Timtiman at the Restaurant because the latter told him that he will elope with the girl. That his purpose in going to the restaurant was to help the accused talk to the girl so that the two could elope. That upon arriving at the restaurant while waiting for the food to be served, he talked with the girl and asked her if she was really decided to elope with his nephew, and she answered yes. That at the time they were seated on the table, Eric Timtiman was seated on his left, and the woman, Angelita San Juan on his right and at the time he was facing the window. That their table is about three (3) arms length away from the door of the restaurant. That upon arriving at the restaurant, two of the tables were occupied, one by two (2) persons drinking beers and the other by three (3) persons drinking soft drinks. That at the other table occupied by two persons who were drinking beers, he noticed a small clutch bag on the table.

That he was surprised and looked toward the direction of the comfort room, then the other person, and companion, suddenly went out of the restaurant. At that juncture, another man entered the restaurant coming from the highway and said, ""Hayun, baka iyon, hulihin mo,"" pointing to Eric Timtiman. That this order was directed to the person who has entered the restaurant, and the order from the person who just came out of the comfort room when he did not find anyone at the table vacated by the two persons drinking beer.

That she was left behind at the restaurant crying, and later on she rode in a tricycle and went to the mother of the accused to inform her of what happened."" (Decision, pp. 3-5; 
Rollo
, pp. 13-15)






The appellant raises the following assignment of errors, to wit:






I


THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED ON THE BASIS MERELY OF THE COURT'S ASSUMPTION THAT THE LATTER WAS THE ONLY PERSON PRESENT AT THE RESTAURANT FITTING THE DESCRIPTION 'TALL, MUSCULAR AND WITH WELL-BUILT PHYSIQUE.


II


THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED DESPITE THE CLEAR UNCERTAINTY AND VAGUENESS OF THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES AND THE TOTAL LACK OF PROOF BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.


III


THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED DESPITE THE ILLEGALITY OF HIS ARREST.


IV


THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE HEREIN ACCUSED DESPITE THE GRAVE OPENLY ADMITTED DOUBTS SURROUNDING HIS ARREST


V


THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PRESENT ANY CORROBORATING EVIDENCE IN THE CASE.


(Appellant's Brief, pp. 8-9)






From a careful reading of the records, we find that the prosecution evidence failed to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence presented was insufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence in favor of the accused. The appellant should, therefore, be acquitted.


This Court is well aware of the established rule that findings of fact of the trail court are given great weight and a high degree of respect by the appellate court considering that the former is in a better position to pass upon the matter of credibility of witnesses (
See 
People v. Naguita, G.R. No. 76002, April 22, 1992; People v. Castillo, G.R. No. 93408, April 10, 1992). However, we will not hesitate to take exception to this rule in order to keep faith with the immutable principle that every criminal conviction must be supported by proof beyond reasonable doubt. (People v. Viray, 202 SCRA 320, 327 [1991]). Among the exceptions to the rule are: (a) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises and conjectures; (b) the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (c) there is grave abuse of discretion; (d) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; and (e) the court in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and appellee (People v. Giron, 192 SCRA 141, 148-149 [1990])
 citing 
People v. Ale, 145 SCRA 58 [1986]). Another exception is where the lower court overlooked certain facts of substance and value that if considered would affect the result of the case. (People v. Nuñez, G.R. No. 79316, April 10 1992; People v. Salcedo, 195 SCRA 345, 348-349 [1991]). This cases falls under the exception.


It is not disputed that there was indeed, a violation of Section 4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended) but can we state beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who committed such violation?


The requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt requires moral certainty of guilt, ""a certainly that convinces and satisfies the reason and conscience of those who are to act upon it."" (People v. Viray, 
supra
, p. 332) This requirement was not met in the instant case.


To support the judgment of conviction, the trial court mainly relied upon the testimony of the poseur-buyer, Sgt. Norberto Macaraeg. The testimony of Sgt. Macaraeg, standing alone, would have been sufficient to convict the appellant. Taken by itself, it would have been believable as there were no inconsistencies in his testimony. Reasonable doubt, however, was introduced as Sgt. Macaraeg's testimony had to be taken together with the testimony of his companion during the buy-bust operation, the other prosecution witness, C1C Nonato Esquillon.


The testimonies of the two policeman, both prosecution witnesses are not in accord with each other. There is a variance as to what happened upon the arrest of Macaraeg.


According to Macaraeg, upon receiving the marijuana, he announced the arrest of the appellant (TSN, April 23, 1991, p. 8). On the other hand, Esquillon testified that upon his entrance in the restaurant, he saw Macaraeg coming out from the comfort room telling him ""baka iyon, kasama iyon"" pointing to the appellant. (TSN, May 15, 19911, p. 4) If Macaraeg's testimony is indeed true, then how is it that Esquillon saw him come out of the comfort room pointing to the appellant when he said that he was at the appellant's table announcing his arrest. (TSN, April 23, 1991, pp. 6-8)


The testimony of Esquillon is in fact more in consonance with the testimonies of the defense witnesses. Renato Concepcion, one of the defense witnesses, testified that a person who had just gotten out from the comfort room told another person who had just entered the restaurant ""Hayun, baka iyon, hulihin mo"" pointing to the appellant. (TSN, May 21, 1991, p. 5) Angelita San Juan testified to the same circumstances. (TSN, May 21, 1991, pp. 11-13).


As gathered from a reading of the transcript of stenographic notes, Macaraeg's version is as follows: that he entered the restaurant and approached the appellant asking if he could buy marijuana from him. That the appellant acceded to his request and upon the exchange of the marijuana and money, he announced the arrest of the appellant. That his companion, Esquillon, then approached the appellant and handcuffed him. Conversely, the version of the defense is as follows: That a person entered restaurant and approached two men who seated at another table. That one of the men stood up and went inside the comfort room. That the person who entered the restaurant got impatient and followed the man inside the comfort room. That the other man left at the table went out of the restaurant. That afterwards, the man who followed to the comfort room went out and told a person who just entered the restaurant ""Hayan, baka iyon, hulihin mo."" That the man who just entered the restaurant arrested the appellant. It can be inferred from the testimony of Esquillon taken in conjunction with the version of the defense that the person who came out of the comfort room was Macaraeg and the person directed to arrest the appellant was Esquillon.


Two versions are presented before us. The version of Macaraeg which was the basis of the judgment of conviction of the lower court and the version of the defense which is even supported by the testimony of one of the prosecution witnesses, one of the policemen involved in the buy-bust operation. It has been held in 
People v. Remorosa
, 200 SCRA 350, 360 [1991] that:






xxx			xxx			xxx


If the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is not sufficient to support a conviction. (Cited in People v. Ale, No. 70998, October 14, 1988, 145 SCRA 64)


x x x           x x x          x x x






Aside from the abovementioned, the absence of the three (3) ten peso bills handed over by Macaraeg to the appellant as a material item of evidence must be construed in favor of the appellant. There was a categorical declaration of the transfer of the three (3) ten peso bills (TSN, April 23, 1991, p. 3 and 5) that were supposedly used to buy the marijuana from the appellant. The money therefore is a material item of evidence to prove, not that a sale or delivery had taken place, but that there was indeed a ""transactional relationship"" between Macaraeg and the appellant who was immediately apprehended after the ""transaction."" (People v. Mendoza, 203 SCRA 148, 157 [1991])


The Solicitor General, in the appellee's grief, cited 
People v. Tejada
, 170 SCRA 497 [1989]) to support its stand on the non-presentation of the three (3) ten-peso bills. In said case, we have ruled that ""so long as the marijuana actually given by the appellant was presented before the lower court, the absence of the marked money does not create a hiatus in the prosecution evidence."" In the aforecited 
People v. Mendoza, supra 
at p. 158, we have stated that:






xxx			xxx			xxx


. . . [t]here is one material factual difference between Tejada and the case at bar. In Tejada, the absence of evidence of the marked money arose from the fact that the other law officers arrived before the appellant could get the money. (
Ibid
, p. 504) Therefore, such money never came into play and presenting the marked bills would have served no evidentiary value. In the present case, the appellant was alleged to have received the money and was immediately apprehended thereafter. In fact, Pat. Manaois is supposed to have retrieved the P100 bill from appellant.


x x x           x x x          x x x






The factual circumstances of the instant cases are more similar to that of the case of Mendoza rather than that of Tejada.


This case may be taken by law enforcement officers as a setback in the government's drive against traffic in prohibited drugs, for after all, law officers are presumed to have performed their duties regularly. Yet, this presumption cannot, by itself, prevail over the constitutional presumption of innocence of the accused. (People v. Mendoza, 
supra
, p. 159
 citing 
People v. Canido, 167 SCRA 462 [1988]).


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The appellant is AQUITTED on grounds of reasonable doubt and ordered immediately RELEASED unless he is detained on some other charge.


SO ORDERED.
