SECOND DIVISION


Â 


G.R. No. 94071	March 31, 1992


NEW LIFE ENTERPRISES and JULIAN SY,
 
petitioners,

vs.


HON. COURT OF APPEALS, EQUITABLE INSURANCE CORPORATION, RELIANCE SURETY AND INSURANCE CO., INC. and WESTERN GUARANTY CORPORATION,
 
respondents.




REGALADO, 
J.:


This appeal by 
certiorari
 seeks the nullification of
 
the decision
 
1
 of
 
respondent Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 13866 which reversed the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch LVII at Lucena
 
City, jointly
 
deciding Civil Cases Nos. 6-84, 7-84 and
 
8-84 thereof and consequently ordered the dismissal of the aforesaid actions filed by herein petitioners.


The undisputed background of this case as
 
found by
 
the court 
a quo 
and adopted
 
by respondent court, being sustained by the evidence on record, we hereby reproduce the same with approval. 
2






The antecedents of this case show
 
that Julian Sy
 
and Jose Sy Bang have formed
 
a business partnership in
 
the City of
 
Lucena. Under the business name of New Life Enterprises, the partnership engaged in
 
the sale of
 
construction materials
 
at
 
its
 
place
 
of
 
business, a two storey building situated at Iyam, Lucena
 
City. The
 
facts show that Julian Sy insured the stocks in
 
trade of New Life Enterprises
 
with Western Guaranty Corporation, Reliance Surety and Insurance. Co., Inc., and Equitable Insurance Corporation.


On May
 
15,
 
1981,
 
Western
 
Guaranty Corporation issued
 
Fire
 
Insurance
 
Policy
 
No. 37201 in the amount of
 
P350,000.00. This policy was renewed on May, 13, 1982.


On July 30,1981, Reliance Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. issued Fire Insurance
 
Policy No. 69135
 
in
 
the amount of P300,000.00 (Renewed under Renewal Certificate
 
No.
 
41997)
 
An
 
additional insurance
 
was
 
issued
 
by
 
the
 
same
 
company
 
on November
 
12,
 
1981
 
under
 
Fire
 
Insurance
 
Policy No. 71547 in the amount of P700,000.00.


On
 
February
 
8,
 
1982,
 
Equitable
 
Insurance Corporation
 
issued
 
Fire
 
Insurance
 
Policy
 
No.
 
39328 in the amount of P200,000.00.


Thus
 
when
 
the
 
building
 
occupied
 
by
 
the
 
New Life Enterprises was
 
gutted
 
by
 
fire
 
at
 
about
 
2:00 o'clock
 
in
 
the
 
morning
 
of
 
October
 
19,
 
1982,
 
the stocks
 
in
 
the trade
 
inside
 
said
 
building
 
were
 
insured against fire
 
in
 
the
 
total
 
amount
 
of
 
P1,550,000.00. According
 
to
 
the
 
certification
 
issued
 
by
 
the Headquarters,
 
Philippine Constabulary /Integrated National Police, Camp
 
Crame,
 
the
 
cause
 
of
 
fire
 
was electrical
 
in
 
nature.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
plaintiffs, the
 
building
 
and
 
the
 
stocks
 
inside
 
were
 
burned. After
 
the
 
fire,
 
Julian
 
Sy
 
went
 
to
 
the
 
agent
 
of Reliance
 
Insurance
 
whom
 
he
 
asked
 
to
 
accompany
 
him to the office
 
of
 
the
 
company
 
so
 
that
 
he
 
can
 
file his
 
claim.
 
He
 
averred
 
that
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
his claim,
 
he submitted
 
the
 
fire
 
clearance,
 
the insurance
 
policies
 
and inventory of
 
stocks.
 
He further testified that
 
the three insurance companies are sister companies,
 
and
 
as
 
a
 
matter
 
of fact
 
when
 
he
 
was following-up
 
his
 
claim
 
with Equitable Insurance, the Claims
 
Manager
 
told
 
him
 
to go first to Reliance Insurance
 
and
 
if
 
said
 
company agrees
 
to
 
pay,
 
they would also
 
pay. The
 
same treatment
 
was
 
given him by
 
the
 
other
 
insurance companies.
 
Ultimately,
 
the
 
three
 
insurance
 
companies denied plaintiffs' claim for payment.


In its letter
 
of
 
denial
 
dated
 
March
 
9,
 
1983, (Exhibit ""C"" No.
 
8-84)
 
Western
 
Guaranty
 
Corporation
 
through
 
Claims
 
Manager
 
Bernard
 
S.
 
Razon
 
told
 
the plaintiff
 
that his claim
 
""is denied
 
for
 
breach
 
of
 
policy
 
conditions.""
 
Reliance
 
Insurance
 
purveyed the same message in its letter dated November 23, 1982
 
and
 
signed
 
by
 
Executive
 
Vice-President
 
Mary Dee Co
 
(Exhibit
 ""
C""
 
No.
 
7-84)
 
which
 
said
 
that ""plaintiff's claim
 
is
 
denied
 
for
 
breach
 
of
 
policy conditions."" The
 
letter
 
of
 
denial
 
received
 
by
 
the plaintiff
 
from
 
Equitable
 
Insurance Corporation
 
(Exhibit
 ""
C"" No. 6-84) was of the same tenor,
 
as said letter dated February 22, 1983, and signed by Vice-President Elma
 
R.
 
Bondad,
 
said
 
""we
 
find
 
that
 
certain policy
 
conditions
 
were
 
violated,
 
therefore, we regret, we
 
have
 
to
 
deny
 
your
 
claim, as
 
it
 
is hereby denied in its entirety.""


In
 
relation
 
to
 
the
 
case
 
against
 
Reliance Surety
 
and
 
Insurance
 
Company,
 
a
 
certain
 
Atty.
 
Serafin D.
 
Dator,
 
acting
 
in
 
behalf of the plaintiff,
 
sent
 
a
 
letter
 
dated
 
February
 
13,
 
1983 (Exhibit ""G-l""
 
No 7-84)
 
to
 
Executive Vice-President Mary Dee Co asking
 
that
 
he be
 
informed
 
as
 
to the
 
specific
 
policy conditions allegedly violated
 
by
 
the
 
plaintiff.
 
In
 
her
 
reply-letter dated March 30,
 
1983,
 
Executive
 
Vice-President
 
Mary Dee Co informed Atty. Dator
 
that
 
Julian
 
Sy
 
violated Policy Condition No. ""3""
 
which
 
requires
 
the
 
insured to
 
give
 
notice
 
of
 
any
 
insurance
 
or
 
insurances
 
already effected covering the stocks in trade.

Because of the denial of their
 
claims
 
for
 
payment
 
by
 
the three (3)
 
insurance companies,
 
petitioner
 
filed
 
separate civil
 
actions
 
against
 
the
 
former
 
before
 
the
 
Regional
 
Trial Court
 
of
 
Lucena
 
City,
 
which
 
cases
 
were
 
consolidated
 
for trial, and
 
thereafter
 
the
 
court
 
below
 
rendered
 
its
 
decision on December 19, l986 with the following disposition:






WHEREFORE,
 
judgment
 
in
 
the
 
above-entitled
 
cases is rendered in the following manner, viz:


1.	In Civil Case

the

(P300,000.00
 
under
 
Policy No.
 
69135
 
and
 
P700,000.00
 
under
 
Policy
 
No.
 
71547) and
 
considering
 
that
 
payment
 
of
 
the
 
claim
 
of
 
the insured
 
has
 
been
 
unreasonably
 
denied,
 
pursuant
 
to Sec.

when

Claim
 
was

3.	In Civil Case No.

Lucena
 
City,
 
as
 
stipulated
 
on
 
the face
 
of
 
Policy
 
No.

of
 
money
 
has
 
been unreasonably

Sec.
 
244
 
of

filed
 
formal
 
claim

full
 
indemnity according to adjuster Vetremar
 
Dela
 
Merced)
 
until they are fully paid.

As
 
aforestated,
 
respondent Court of
 
Appeals
 
reversed said
 
judgment
 
of the trial court, hence this
 
petition
 
the crux
 
wherein is whether or not Conditions Nos. 3 and
 
27
 
of the
 
insurance
 
contracts
 
were
 
violated
 
by
 
petitioners
 
thereby resulting in their
 
forfeiture
 
of
 
all
 
the
 
benefits
 
thereunder.


Condition
 
No.
 
3
 
of
 
said
 
insurance
 
policies,
 
otherwise known as the
 
""Other
 
Insurance
 
Clause,""
 
is
 
uniformly
 
contained in
 
all
 
the
 
aforestated insurance
 
contracts
 
of
 
herein
 
petitioners, as follows:






3.	The insured shall
 
give
 
notice
 
to
 
the
 
Company of
 
any
 
insurance
 
or
 
insurances
 
already effected,
 
or
 
which may
 
subsequently
 
be
 
effected, covering any
 
of
 
the
 
property or properties consisting
 
of
 
stocks
 
in
 
trade,
 
goods
 
in
 
process and/or
 
inventories
 
only
 
hereby
 
insured,
 
and
 
unless such
 
notice
 
be
 
given
 
and
 
the
 
particulars
 
of
 
such insurance
 
or
 
insurances
 
be
 
stated
 
therein
 
or endorsed on this policy pursuant to Section 50 of the Insurance Code,
 
by
 
or
 
on
 
behalf
 
of
 
the
 
Company before
 
the
 
occurrence
 
of
 
any
 
loss
 
or
 
damage,
 
all benefits under
 
this
 
policy
 
shall be deemed forfeited, 
provided 
however, that this condition shall
 
not
 
apply when the total insurance
 
or insurances in force at the
 
time
 
of
 
loss
 
or
 
damage
 
not
 
more
 
than P200,000.00. 
5






Petitioners
 
admit
 
that
 
the
 
respective
 
insurance
 
policies issued
 
by
 
private
 
respondents
 
did
 
not
 
state
 
or
 
endorse thereon the
 
other
 
insurance
 
coverage
 
obtained
 
or
 
subsequently effected on the same stocks in trade for the loss of which compensation
 
is
 
claimed
 
by petitioners.
 
6
 The
 
policy issued
 
by
 
respondent
 
Western
 
Guaranty
 
Corporation
 
(Western) did not declare
 
respondent
 
Reliance
 
Surety
 
and
 
Insurance
 
Co., Inc. (Reliance)
 
and respondent Equitable Insurance Corporation
 
(Equitable)
 
as
 
co-insurers
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
stocks, while
 
Reliance's
 
Policies
 
covering
 
the
 
same
 
stocks
 
did
 
not likewise
 
declare
 
Western
 
and
 
Equitable
 
as
 
such
 
co-insurers. It is further
 
admitted
 
by
 
petitioners
 
that
 
Equitable's
 
policy stated ""nil"" in the space thereon requiring indication of any co-insurance although there
 
were
 
three (3) policies subsisting on the same stocks in trade at
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
the loss,
 
namely, that of Western in the
 
amount
 
of
 
P350,000.00 and
 
two
 
(2)
 
policies of Reliance in the total amount of P1,000,000.00. 
7


In other words, the coverage
 
by
 
other
 
insurance
 
or
 
co-insurance effected or
 
subsequently
 
arranged
 
by
 
petitioners were neither
 
stated
 
nor
 
endorsed
 
in
 
the policies of the three (3) private respondents, warranting forfeiture
 
of
 
all benefits thereunder
 
if
 
we
 
are
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
express stipulation in the aforequoted Policy Condition No. 3.


Petitioners contend that they are
 
not
 
to
 
be
 
blamed
 
for the omissions, alleging
 
that
 
insurance
 
agent
 
Leon
 
Alvarez (for Western) and Yap Kam Chuan (for Reliance
 
and
 
Equitable) knew about the existence of the additional insurance
 
coverage and that they were not informed
 
about
 
the
 
requirement
 
that such other or additional insurance should
 
be
 
stated
 
in
 
the policy,
 
as
 
they
 
have
 
not
 
even
 
read
 
policies.
8
 These contentions cannot pass judicial muster.


The terms of
 
the
 
contract
 
are
 
clear
 
and
 
unambiguous. The
 
insured
 
is
 
specifically
 
required
 
to
 
disclose
 
to
 
the insurer any other insurance and its particulars
 
which
 
he
 
may have effected on the same
 
subject
 
matter.
 
The
 
knowledge
 
of such insurance by
 
the
 
insurer's
 
agents,
 
even
 
assuming
 
the acquisition thereof by the former, is
 
not
 
the
 
""notice""
 
that would
 
estop the insurers from denying the
 
claim. Besides, the so-called theory of imputed knowledge, that is, knowledge of the agent is knowledge
 
of
 
the
 
principal,
 
aside
 
from
 
being of
 
dubious
 
applicability
 
here
 
has
 
likewise
 
been
 
roundly refuted
 
by
 
respondent
 
court
 
whose
 
factual
 
findings
 
we
 
find acceptable.


Thus,
 
it
 
points out
 
that
 
while petitioner
 
Julian
 
Sy claimed
 
that
 
he
 
had
 
informed
 
insurance
 
agent
 
Alvarez regarding the co-insurance on the property, he contradicted himself
 
by
 
inexplicably
 
claiming
 
that
 
he
 
had
 
not
 
read
 
the terms
 
of the policies; that Yap
 
Dam
 
Chuan
 
could
 
not
 
likewise have obtained such knowledge
 
for
 
the
 
same
 
reason,
 
aside
 
from the fact that the
 
insurance
 
with
 
Western
 
was
 
obtained
 
before those of Reliance
 
and
 
Equitable;
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
conclusion
 
of the
 
trial
 
court
 
that
 
Reliance
 
and
 
Equitable
 
are
 
""sister companies""
 
is
 
an
 
unfounded
 
conjecture
 
drawn
 
from
 
the
 
mere fact that Yap Kam Chuan was an
 
agent
 
for
 
both
 
companies
 
which also had the same
 
insurance
 
claims
 
adjuster.
 
Availment
 
of the services
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
agents
 
and
 
adjusters
 
by
 
different companies is a common
 
practice
 
in
 
the
 
insurance
 
business
 
and such facts do
 
not
 
warrant
 
the
 
speculative
 
conclusion
 
of
 
the trial court.


Furthermore,
 
when
 
the
 
words
 
and
 
language
 
of
 
documents are clear and plain or
 
readily
 
understandable
 
by
 
an ordinary reader thereof, there is absolutely no room for interpretation
 
or construction anymore.
9
 Courts
 
are
 
not allowed to make contracts for
 
the
 
parties;
 
rather,
 
they
 
will intervene only
 
when
 
the
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
policy
 
are
 
ambiguous, equivocal, or
 
uncertain.
 
10
 
The
 
parties
 
must
 
abide
 
by
 
the terms
 
of
 
the
 
contract
 
because
 
such
 
terms
 
constitute
 
the measure
 
of
 
the
 
insurer's
 
liability
 
and
 
compliance
 
therewith is a condition
 
precedent
 
to
 
the
 
insured's
 
right
 
of
 
recovery from the insurer.
 
11


While it is a cardinal principle
 
of
 
insurance
 
law
 
that
 
a policy or contract of
 
insurance
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
construed
 
liberally in
 
favor
 
of
 
the
 
insured
 
and
 
strictly
 
against
 
the
 
insurer company,
 
yet
 
contracts
 
of
 
insurance,
 
like
 
other
 
contracts, are to be construed according to the
 
sense
 
and
 
meaning
 
of
 
the terms which the
 
parties
 
themselves
 
have
 
used.
 
If
 
such
 
terms are clear and unambiguous,
 
they
 
must
 
be
 
taken
 
and
 
understood in
 
their plain,
 
ordinary and popular sense. 
12
 
Moreover, obligations
 
arising
 
from
 
contracts
 
have
 
the
 
force
 
of
 
law between the
 
contracting
 
parties
 
and
 
should
 
be
 
complied
 
with in good faith.
 
13


Petitioners should be aware of
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
a
 
party
 
is not relieved of the duty to exercise the ordinary care and prudence
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
exacted
 
in
 
relation
 
to other contracts.
 
The conformity of the insured to the terms of the policy
 
is
 
implied
 
from
 
his
 
failure
 
to express
 
any disagreement with what
 
is
 provided 
for.
14
 
It
 
may
 
be
 
true that the
 
majority
 
rule, as cited by
 
petitioners,
 
is
 
that
 
injured persons
 
may
 
accept
 
policies
 
without
 
reading
 
them,
 
and that
 
this is not negligence
 per se.
 
15 
But, this
 
is not without any exception.
 
It is and was incumbent upon
 
petitioner Sy to read the insurance contracts, and this can be reasonably expected of
 
him
 
considering
 
that
 
he
 
has
 
been
 
a businessman since 1965
16
 
and
 
the contract concerns indemnity in case of
 
loss
 
in
 
his
 
money-making
 
trade
 
of
 
which important consideration
 
he
 
could
 
not
 
have
 
been
 
unaware
 
as
 
it was pre-in case of loss in his money-making trade of which important consideration he could not have been unaware as it was precisely the reason for his procuring the same.


We
 
reiterate
 
our
 
pronouncement
 
in
 Pioneer Insurance and Surety Corporation vs. Yap:
 
17






. . . And
 
considering
 
the
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
policy
 
which
 
required
 
the
 
insured
 
to
 
declare
 
other
 
insurances,
 
the
 
statement
 
in
 
question
 
must
 
be
 
deemed
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
statement (warranty) binding on both
 
insurer and insured, that there were no
 
other insurance on the property. . . .


The
 
annotation
 
then,
 
must
 
be
 
deemed to
 
be
 
a
 
warranty
 
that
 
the
 
property
 
was
 
not insured by
 
any other policy. Violation
 
thereof
 
entitled
 
the
 
insurer
 
to rescind (Sec. 69, Insurance Act).
 
Such
 
misrepresentation is fatal in the
 
light
 
of our
 
views
 
in
 Santa Ana vs. Commercial Union Assurance Company, Ltd.
,
 
55
 
Phil. 329. The
 
materiality
 
of
 
non-disclosure
 
of other insurance policies is not open to doubt.


xxx			xxx			xxx


The obvious purpose
 
of the aforesaid requirement
 
in
 
the
 
policy is
 
to
 
prevent
 
over-insurance and thus avert the perpetration of fraud.
 
The
 
public, as well as the insurer, is
 
interested in preventing the situation in
 
which
 
a
 
fire
 
would
 
be profitable to the
 
insured.
 
According
 
to Justice Story: ""The insured has no
 
right
 
to
 
complain,
 
for
 
he assents to comply with
 
all
 
the
 
stipulations
 
on his
 
side,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
entitle
 
himself
 
to
 
the benefit
 
of
 
the
 
contract,
 
which,
 
upon
 
reason
 
or principle, he has
 
no
 
right
 
to
 
ask
 
the
 
court
 
to dispense with the performance
 
of
 
his
 
own
 
part
 
of
 
the agreement, and yet to bind
 
the
 
other
 
party
 
to obligations,
 
which,
 
but
 
for
 
those
 
stipulations, would not have been entered into.""






Subsequently, in the case of 
Pacific Banking Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, et al
., 
18
 
we held:






It is not disputed that the
 
insured
 
failed
 
to reveal before the loss
 
three
 
other
 
insurances.
 
As found by the Court of
 
Appeals,
 
by
 
reason
 
of
 
said
 
unrevealed insurances, the insured
 
had
 
been guilty
 
of a false
 
declaration;
 
a
 
clear
 
misrepresentation
 
and a vital one because where the
 
insured
 
had
 
been
 
asked to reveal but
 
did
 
not,
 
that
 
was
 
deception.
 
Otherwise stated, had the insurer
 
known
 
that
 
there
 
were many co-insurances, it could have
 
hesitated
 
or plainly desisted from entering
 
into
 
such
 
contract. Hence,
 
the
 
insured
 
was
 
guilty
 
of
 
clear
 
fraud
 
(
Rollo
, p. 25).


Petitioner's
 
contention
 
that
 
the
 
allegation
 
of fraud is but a
 
mere
 
inference
 
or
 
suspicion
 
is
 
untenable. In fact, concrete
 
evidence
 
of
 
fraud
 
or false declaration by the
 
insured
 
was
 
furnished
 
by
 
the petitioner itself when the facts alleged
 
in
 
the policy under
 
clauses
 ""
Co-Insurances
 
Declared""
 
and ""Other
 
Insurance
 
Clause""
 
are
 
materially
 
different from the actual number of
 
co-insurances
 
taken
 
over the
 
subject
 
property.
 
Consequently,
 ""
the
 
whole foundation of the contract fails, the risk
 
does
 
not
 
attach
 
and
 
the
 
policy
 
never
 
becomes
 
a
 
contract between the parties.""
 
Representations
 
of
 
facts
 
are the foundation
 
of
 
the
 
contract
 
and if the
 
foundation does not exist,
 
the
 
superstructure
 
does not
 
arise.
 
Falsehood
 
in
 
such
 
representations
 
is
 
not shown to vary or
 
add
 
to
 
the
 
contract,
 
or
 
to terminate a contract which has once
 
been
 
made,
 
but to show
 
that
 
no
 
contract
 
has ever existed
 
(Tolentino,
 
Commercial
 
Laws
 
of
 
the
 
Philippines, p. 991,
 
Vol.
 
II,
 
8th
 
Ed.,)
 
A
 
void
 
or
 
inexistent contract is one which has no force
 
and
 
effect
 
from the very beginning, as if it had never
 
been
 
entered
 
into, and which cannot be validated
 
either
 
by
 
time
 
or by ratification (Tongoy
 
vs.
 
C.A.,
 
123
 
SCRA
 
99 (1983); Avila v. C.A., 145 SCRA, 1986).


As
 
the
 
insurance
 
policy
 
against fire expressly required that notice should be given by the
 
insured
 
of
 
other
 
insurance
 
upon
 
the
 
same property, the
 
total
 
absence
 
of such notice
 
nullifies the policy.






To
 
further
 
warrant
 
and
 
justify
 
the
 
forfeiture
 
of
 
the benefits
 
under
 
the
 
insurance
 
contracts
 
involved,
 
we
 
need merely
 
to
 
turn
 
to
 
Policy
 
Condition
 
No.
 
15
 
thereof,
 
which reads in part:






15.	. . . if
 
any
 
false
 
declaration
 
be
 
made
 
or used in
 
support
 
thereof,
 
. . .
 
all
 
benefits
 
under
 
this Policy shall be forfeited . . . . 
19






Additionally,
 
insofar
 
as
 
the
 
liability
 
of
 
respondent Reliance
 
is
 
concerned,
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
denied
 
that
 
the
 
complaint for recovery was filed in court by petitioners only on January
 
31,
 
1984,
 
or
 
after
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
(1)
 
year
 
had elapsed
 
from
 
petitioners'
 
receipt
 
of
 
the
 
insurers'
 
letter
 
of denial
 
on
 
November
 
29,
 
1982.
 
Policy
 
Condition
 
No.
 
27
 
of their insurance contract with Reliance provides:






27.	
Action or suit clause. 
â
 
If
 
a
 
claim
 
be
 
made
 
and
 
rejected
 
and
 
an
 
action
 
or
 
suit
 
be
 
not
 
commenced either
 
in
 
the
 
Insurance
 
Commission
 
or
 
any
 
court
 
of
 
competent
 
jurisdiction
 
of
 
notice
 
of
 
such rejection,
 
or
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
arbitration
 
taking
 
place as
 provided 
herein,
 
within
 
twelve
 
(12)
 
months
 
after due notice
 
of
 
the
 
award
 
made
 
by
 
the
 
arbitrator
 
or
 
arbitrators or
 
umpire,
 
then
 
the
 
claim
 
shall
 
for
 
all purposes be deemed
 
to
 
have
 
been
 
abandoned
 
and
 
shall
 
not thereafter be recoverable hereunder.
 
20






On this point, the trial court ruled:






. . . However,
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
peculiar circumstances of
 
this
 
case,
 
we hesitate in
 
concluding
 
that
 
plaintiff's
 
right
 
to
 
ventilate
 
his
 
claim
 
in
 
court
 
has
 
been
 
barred
 
by
 
reason
 
of
 
the
 
time
 
constraint
 provided 
in
 
the
 
insurance
 
contract. It is evident
 
that
 
after
 
the
 
plaintiff
 
had
 
received the
 
letter
 
of
 
denial,
 
he
 
still
 
found
 
it
 
necessary
 
to
 
be
 
informed
 
of
 
the
 
specific
 
causes
 
or
 
reasons for the
 
denial
 
of
 
his
 
claim,
 
reason
 
for
 
which
 
his lawyer, Atty. Dator deemed
 
it
 
wise
 
to
 
send
 
a letter
 
of
 
inquiry
 
to
 
the
 
defendant
 
which
 
was
 
answered
 
by defendant's
 
Executive
 
Vice-President
 
in
 
a
 
letter dated
 
March
 
30,
 
1983, . . . .
 
Assuming,
 
gratuitously,
 
that
 
the
 
letter
 
of
 
Executive
 
Vice-President Mary
 
Dee Co dated March 30, 1983, was received
 
by
 
plaintiff on
 
the
 
same
 
date,
 
the period of
 
limitation should start
 
to
 
run
 
only
 
from
 
said date in the spirit of fair play and equity. . . . 
21






We
 
have
 
perforce to reject this theory
 
of
 
the
 
court below for being contrary to what we have heretofore declared:






It
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
the
 
principle
 
laid down by
 
this
 
Court
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
of
 Ang vs. Fulton Fire Insurance Co.
 (2 SCRA
 
945 [1961])
 
to
 
wit:






The
 
condition
 
contained
 
in
 
an
 
insurance
 
policy
 
that
 
claims
 
must
 
be
 
presented within one year after
 
rejection
 
is
 
not
 
merely
 
a
 
procedural
 
requirement
 
but
 
an
 
important
 
matter essential to a prompt settlement
 
of
 
claims against insurance companies as it demands
 
that
 
insurance
 
suits
 
be
 
brought
 
by the
 
insured
 
while
 
the
 
evidence
 
as
 
to
 
the origin
 
and
 
cause
 
of
 
destruction
 
have
 
not yet disappeared.






In
 
enunciating
 
the
 
above-cited
 
principle, this Court
 
had
 
definitely settled
 
the
 
rationale
 
for
 
the necessity
 
of
 
bringing
 
suits
 
against
 
the
 
Insurer within
 
one
 
year
 
from
 
the
 
rejection
 
of
 
the
 
claim. The contention of
 
the
 
respondents
 
that
 
the
 
one-year
 
prescriptive period
 
does not
 
start
 
to
 
run
 
until
 
the
 
petition
 
for
 
reconsideration
 
had
 
been
 
resolved
 
by
 
the
 
insurer,
 
runs
 
counter
 
to
 
the
 
declared
 
purpose for
 
requiring
 
that
 
an action
 
or
 
suit
 
be
 
filed
 
in
 
the Insurance Commission
 
or
 
in
 
a
 
court
 
of
 
competent jurisdiction
 
from
 
the
 
denial
 
of
 
the
 
claim. To
 
uphold respondents' contention would contradict and
 
defeat the very principle which this Court had laid
 
down.
 
Moreover, it
 
can
 
easily
 
be
 
used
 
by
 
insured persons as a scheme or device to waste time until
 
any
 
evidence
 
which
 
may
 
be
 
considered
 
against
 
them is destroyed.


xxx			xxx			xxx


While in the Eagle Star case (96 Phil.
 
701), this
 
Court
 
uses
 
the
 
phrase
 
""final
 
rejection"",
 
the same
 
cannot
 
be
 
taken
 
to
 
mean
 
the
 
rejection
 
of
 
a petition for
 
reconsideration
 
as insisted by respondents. Such
 
was
 
clearly
 
not
 
the
 
meaning
 
contemplated
 
by
 
this
 
Court.
 
The
 
insurance
 
policy
 
in said case
 
provides
 
that
 
the
 
insured
 
should
 
file his claim first, with the
 
carrier
 
and
 
then
 
with
 
the insurer. The
 
""final
 
rejection""
 
being
 
referred
 
to
 
in
 
said case is the rejection by the insurance
 
company. 
22






Furthermore, assuming
 arguendo 
that
 
petitioners
 
felt
 
the legitimate
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
clarified
 
as
 
to
 
the
 
policy
 
condition violated,
 
there was a considerable lapse of time from their receipt of the insurer's clarificatory letter dated March 30, 1983,
 
up
 
to the time the complaint was filed
 
in
 
court on January
 
31,
 
1984.
 
The
 
one-year
 
prescriptive
 
period
 
was
 
yet to
 
expire
 
on
 
November
 
29,
 
1983,
 
or
 
about
 
eight
 
(8)
 
months from the receipt
 
of
 
the
 
clarificatory
 
letter,
 
but
 
petitioners let the period
 
lapse
 
without
 
bringing
 
their
 
action
 
in
 
court. We
 
accordingly
 
find
 
no
 
""peculiar
 
circumstances""
 
sufficient to relax
 
the
 
enforcement
 
of
 
the
 
one-year
 
prescriptive
 
period and we,
 
therefore,
 
hold
 
that
 
petitioners' claim was definitely filed out of time.


WHEREFORE, finding no cogent
 
reason
 
to
 
disturb
 
the judgment of
 
respondent
 
Court
 
of
 
Appeals,
 
the
 
same
 
is
 
hereby
 
AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.
