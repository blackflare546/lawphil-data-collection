On the 27th day of June, 1907, after considering the grounds upon which the motion to dissolve were based, the said injunction was dissolved. 


On the 21st day of June, 1907, the Attorney-General presented a demurrer to the complaint filed in said cause.

Upon a consideration of the motion of the plaintiff to dismiss his action, the same is granted, without prejudice to the right of the defendant to present in this court specifications, in the nature of a complaint, setting forth the grounds relied upon for the purpose of recovering the damages against the plaintiff, before final judgment is entered dismissing the said cause, in accordance with the ruling of this court in the case of Somes 
vs
. Crossfield, et al.

 (5 Off. Gaz., 462). 


The Attorney-General in his motion asks that this court order the said cause to be referred to the Court of First Instance of the Province of Batangas for the purpose of ascertaining and reporting to this court the amount of damages which the defendant has sustained by reason of the granting of the said injunction. The defendant is entitled to have the amount of his damages ascertained and to have them included in the final judgment in said cause, but section 170 of the Code of Procedure of Civil Actions provides that said damages 
shall be ascertained by the court in which the action is pending
. The present was an original action in this court; therefore it is the order of this court that the defendant file, in this court, within a period of ten days after the receipt of notice of this order, specifications, in the nature of a complaint, setting forth the grounds relied upon for the purpose of recovering damages against the plaintiff and his bondsmen, by reason of the granting of the said injunction, and to serve a copy of these specifications upon the plaintiff and the said bondsmen. So ordered.
