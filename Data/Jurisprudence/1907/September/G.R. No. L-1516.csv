JOHNSON, 
J.:


On the 29th day of May, 1903, the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of said city, charging the defendant, Dominador Gomez, with the crime of ""founding, directing, and presiding over an illegal association, the purposes and circumstances of which are contrary to public morals and whose object is to commit certain crimes punished by the Penal Code,"" committed as follows: 




That on or about the 1st day of October, 1902, in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, the said Dominador Gomez founded an illicit association known as ""The Democratic Labor Union of the Philippines;"" that at the time of the said organization of said association the said Dominador Gomez prepared, submitted to, and caused to be adopted by said association a certain code of regulations transcribed into both the Spanish and Tagalog languages, which regulations, at the instance and through the advice and influence of the said Dominador Gomez, were then and there and thereafter and up to the date hereof printed, published, and delivered to working men and women in large numbers, to wit, eight thousand or thereabouts, in the various factories and employments in said city of Manila and elsewhere in the Philippine Islands, a true copy of which regulations is annexed hereto, marked ""Exhibit A,"" and made a part hereof; 


That the said Dominador Gomez, at the time of the said organization of said association as aforesaid, caused himself to be elected as president and director thereof for a period of two years thereafter, and has served and acted in that capacity continuously since the organization of said association, and is now serving and acting in such capacity;

Subscribed and sworn to. 




On the 13th day of June, 1903, the attorney for the defendant, Gibbs, Kincaid, and Del-Pan, demurred to the said complaint upon the following grounds: 


(1) 	That the said complaint does not conform with the essential requisites prescribed by law; and 


(2) 	That the fact stated therein do not constitute a crime. 


On the 15th day of July, 1903, the Hon. John C. Sweeney, presiding in said court, overruled and disallowed said demurrer. To this ruling of the court the defendant duly excepted. 


Later the attorneys for the defense demanded the appointment of assessors, under the provision of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions for the appointment of assessors, to assist the judge in the trial of said cause. Upon this request and in accordance with the law Ariston Bautista and Pacifico Reyes were duly appointed as such assessors, and on the 12th day of August, 1903, took their oath of office. On the same day the trial of said cause was duly commenced in said Court of First Instance. 


On the 25th day of September, 1903, the said assessors filed their finding of facts in said cause, as follows: 




The undersigned, assessors appointed in the above- entitled cause, state: That the complaint is based upon the following facts: 


(
a
) 	That on or about the 1st day of October, 1902, in the city of Manila, the said Dominador Gomez established an illicit association known as the ""Union Obrera Democratica de Filipinas."" 


(
b
) 	That on the date of the organization of said association, the said Dr. Gomez, prepared, submitted for approval, and caused to be adopted certain by-laws, translated in the Spanish and Tagalog languages. 


(
c
) 	That said by-laws were printed and distributed to the members, whose number was approximately eight thousand. 


(
d
) 	That said Dominador Gomez, at the time of the organization of said association, caused himself to be elected president and director of the same for the term of two consecutive years, and performed and exercised the duties of said offices. 


(
e
) 	That said by-laws have not been altered and still continue in force. 


(
 f 
) 	That the fundamental principles of said association as stated in the said by-laws, which were made the ground of this complaint, and which are illegal and contrary to public morals, are as follows: ""Chapter II, section 2. It will also constitute an integral part of its propaganda to impress upon the workmen the beautiful science of knowing how to discreetly and conveniently exercise their sacred rights in every way, while fulfilling their duties."" 


That is to say [interprets the prosecution], the development of a hostile sentiment and a formal movement of men and women against the government of the United States in the Philippine Islands. 


(
g
) 	That said Dominador Gomez announced in Los Obreros, a newspaper printed and administered by said association, that a department of said paper known as the printing department was a regularly and legally organized company authorized and licensed to do business. 


(
h
) 	That Dominador Gomez has sold a great many shares in the alleged stock company amounting to the value of two thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven pesos, Mexican currency, and has received the proceeds of such sales, or the amount of two thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven pesos. 


(
i
) 	That the purpose of said association was to bring together a large number of men and women in order to raise the price of labor. 


(
 j
) 	That Dominador Gomez extended said association throughout the city of Manila and the Philippine Islands, until it had secured twelve thousand men and women as members. 


(
k
) 	That Dominador Gomez in accordance with said by-laws and the purpose of the association has up to the present time regularly and continually corresponded, communicated, and conspired with Faustino Guillermo and other officials, agents, representatives, and members of an armed party of men organized to commit theft, rape, robbery, and assassination in said Islands, and moreover to commit the crimes of sedition and treason. 


(
l
) That Dominador Gomez, in accordance with the by-laws of said association, has given aid and succor to the enemies of the Government and of the country. 


Having stated the facts alleged in the complaint which were carefully examined by the undersigned, and in connection with the proofs taken during the trial of the case, there appears: 


That the facts mentioned in this opinion marked with the letters (
a
), (
b
), (
c
), (
d
) and (
e
), viz: That the Union Obrera Democratica de Filipinas is in its object an illicit association; that Dr. Gomez prepared, submitted, and himself approved the by-laws in Tagalog; that he altered section 5 of Chapter V to suit his own desires and to deceive the workmen who did not understand Spanish; that he caused to be printed and distributed some eight thousand copies of said by-laws; that he caused himself to be elected president and director; and that said by-laws have not been altered but still continue in force; none of which acts, however, in the opinion of the undersigned, constitutes crime, especially inasmuch as the prosecution has not succeeded in proving these acts in any way, and inasmuch as the evidence given by Don Isabelo de los Reyes and the other witnesses in the same case shows that the defendant did not organize the Union Obera, which was established before his arrival in the Philippines; that he did not intervene in the making of the translation and in the printing of the Tagalog version of said by-laws, the Spanish edition thereof being the official one by which the association was governed; that he did not cause himself to be elected president and director, and notwithstanding the allegation set out in the complaint, some of the sections of said by-laws were modified by the board of directors in order that greater benefits might be enjoyed by the members of the said association. 


The facts stated in the paragraph marked (
 f 
): The interpretation given by the prosecution to Chapter II, section 2, of the by-laws of the Union Obrera, discloses an absolute ignorance of the meaning and value of Spanish words. The letter and spirit of said section shows in a clear and evident manner that one of the objects of the Union Obrera is to inculcate in the workman (to instruct him) the proper performance of his duties and the exercise of his rights in a discreet and opportune manner. 


What phrase in said section has enabled the prosecution to give it the meaning of ""development of a hostile sentiment and organized movement of men and women against the Government of the United States in the Philippines?"" 


Is it that of instructing the workman in the proper performance of his duties? Is it, perchance, that of teaching the workman how to exercise his rights discreetly and opportunely at all times? Both of these phrases, in the opinion of the undersigned, are entirely contrary to the interpretation given by the prosecution. The first includes the teaching of something beneficial, useful, and necessary to every citizen, since the first duty of a citizen is to strictly obey and respect the laws of the country. The second is the logical consequence of the first and can be interpreted in no other way than literally. 


In regard to the facts stated in those paragraphs marked ""(
g
)"" and ""(
h
),"" we believe that the accused can not be held responsible for them, since it is well known that the issuance of shares was agreed and decided upon in a general meeting of the members; and moreover, the association, as well as Dr. Gomez, was governed by the opinion of Attorney Serra, who, being a lawyer, and the question being purely a legal one, was relied upon, while the defendant has no knowledge of law whatever. 


The fact stated in paragraph marked with the letter ""(
i
)"" is not authorized by any of the sections of the by-laws. The strikes which occurred in Cavite, for the benefit of those participating in which the Union Obrera had given theatrical performances, had not for their object the improper increasing of wages, while the object of the theatrical performances, given by rich and poor together, was only to procure necessities of life for the families of the strikers. Everybody knows the scarcity of articles most necessary for subsistence and the high prices of same. It is but just that the workman should demand from his employer an increase of wages in proportion to the cost of the necessities of life. Strikes are not condemned by any law unless the strikers, to make them effective, employ violent methods such as coercion, intimidation, and public disorder, in which case the strikers are punished, not for being strikers, but for the crimes they commit while striking. Considering that the strikes which occurred in Cavite were extraordinarily peaceful in every way, and that no punishable offense was committed in connection therewith, the undersigned believe that the Union Obrera did not become liable for an illegal act by contributing its resources, not to the furtherance of the strike, but to the maintenance of the strikers; and especially it is true that this act can not be considered illegal when it is remembered that by the meditation of the Union Obrera the struggle was settled to the satisfaction of both parties. 


The act alleged in paragraph (
 j
) is an entirely lawful one, the illegality of the association not having been established. 


In regard to the allegations of paragraph (
k
), the prosecution has presented only one class of proof, which, being examined with entire impartiality, is not sufficient to sustain the assumption that the defendant had any relations with Faustino Guillermo or other officials and members of criminal organizations. This evidence consisted of the telegram sent by the defendant to Governor Taft, and two letters, one addressed to the provincial fiscal of Rizal and the other to General Allen of the Constabulary. It was not proved that the defendant had maintained a correspondence with the ladrones. No letter or document has been presented to justify such a conclusion. Neither has there been any proof presented to show that the defendant conspired with such ladrones. Likewise, during the taking of the evidence, there were not even mentioned the crimes of theft, rape, robbery, assassination, etc., which, in the opinion of the prosecution, were the objects of the Union Obrera. 


With reference to the allegations of paragraph (
l
), there has been no evidence presented tending to show that the defendant has given aid and assistance to the enemies of the Government and of the country. 


Many other proofs have been offered by the prosecution in this case, but their connection with the facts alleged in the complaint not having been established, since they are not pertinent, the undersigned believe it to be unnecessary to consider them. 


It not being the duty of the undersigned to strengthen their arguments by discussing questions of law, but only to pass upon questions of fact, they believe it expedient in closing this opinion to set out a few considerations in justification of their verdict. 


The crime of which Dominador Gomez is accused in this case is that of establishing, managing, and presiding over an illicit association. 


The word association, in its strict sense, is the union or congregation of various individuals for a certain purpose. If it is intended to hold that the Union Obrera is an illegal association, the responsibility for the crimes committed by such association will not only reach one of its members but each and every one of the individuals composing it, in the different grades of culpability prescribed by the Penal Code, either as principals, accomplices, or accessories. 


If it is held that Dominador Gomez is the only culprit, we are placed in the anomalous position of holding that an individual can constitute by himself an association and may be found guilty of being an illegal one. 


Finally, the criminal actions imputed to the defendant were his personal acts, and we do not believe it just that he should be convicted of founding, presiding over, and directing an illegal association, for a legal association can not become illegal through the acts of one of its members, because he who commits such unlawful acts is alone responsible, and in no way can his acts affect the association as a whole. 


In view of the fact that the allegations set out in the complaint were not sufficiently proved, either in a direct and indisputable manner or by circumstantial evidence, the undersigned are of the opinion that the defendant, Dominador Gomez, should be entirely acquitted of the crime charged, namely, that of having established, directed, and presided over an illicit association. 


This is the opinion of the undersigned, save a better judgment.

MANILA, 
September 25, 1903
. 




On the 29th day of September, 1903, the judge of the said court rendered his decision and sentenced the defendant, Dominador Gomez, to be imprisoned for a period of four years and two months in the public carcel of Bilibid, at hard labor, and to pay a fine of 3,250 pesetas and the costs. Judge Sweeney made the following finding of facts in his sentence: 




The facts and circumstances of this case establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant entered into a conspiracy with others which resulted in the formation of this association Union Obrera. The defendant caused himself to be elected president thereof and prepared the regulations ostensibly as a labor union, but the secret and real purpose of the defendant and his co-conspirators and the purpose of the organization being to resist the Administration and overthrow the American government in the Philippine Islands, to this end he conspired and confederated with Faustino Guillermo, Luciano San Miguel, and others in the Philippine Islands who were and are engaged in the crimes of theft, rape, robbery, and murder. 


The court finds that the defendant is the founder, director, and president of the Democratic Labor Union, an illicit and illegal association, the purposes and circumstances of which are contrary to public morals and the object of which is to commit certain crimes punished by the Penal Code. The court does not find any mitigating circumstances in this case whatever, and therefore finds the defendant guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the charges contained in the complaint in this case, as charged therein. 




From this decision of the lower court the defendant duly appealed to this court. 


On the 7th day of November, 1903, the record in said cause was received by the clerk of this court. 


On the 3d day of October, 1904, the appellant filed his brief and assignment of errors in said cause. 


On the 23d day of March, 1907, the Attorney-General for the Philippine Islands filed his reply brief in said cause, and the cause was submitted to the court upon its merits on the 16th day of July, 1907. 


The first question presented to this court by virtue of the overruling of the demurrer presented in the lower court is whether or not the complaint filed in said cause is sufficient. No error is assigned in this court by the appellant, alleging that any evidence presented was admitted or rejected by the lower court because of any defect in said complaint. It would, therefore, seem that the case made in the lower court by the evidence was the same as if the complaint had been sufficient and no demurrer had been presented; in the other words, that the respective parties have presented exactly the same proof which would have been presented upon the theory that the complaint was sufficient in form and substance. Therefore, without passing upon the technical sufficiency of the complaint filed, we have examined the evidence adduced during the trial, for the purpose of ascertaining if such evidence was sufficient to convict the appellant of the crime charged in said complaint. It was the theory of the Government in prosecuting the defendant that the latter had founded, directed, and presided over an illicit association, the purposes and circumstances of which were contrary to public morals and whose object was to commit certain crimes punished by the Penal Code, in violation of article 188, in its relation with article 189 of the same. Article 189 provides the punishment for the founders, directors, and presidents of associations of the class mentioned in article 188, while article 190 provides, among other things, the punishment for the 
individual members of associations
 such are mentioned in article 188. Thus, under articles 189 and 190, the said code has provided punishment not only for the founders, directors, etc., of illicit associations, but for the membership of such associations as well. Therefore, if the evidence should disclose that the association mentioned in the complaint in this case is an illicit association, then it would be the duty of the proper department of the Government to prosecute the individual members of such association also. 


There was much proof adduced during the trial of the cause to show that the defendant, while acting as president of said association, had committed various acts, which the prosecution attempted to show were illegal and contrary to law. It is true that while he was performing these alleged illegal acts he was president of the said association, but there is nothing in the record which shows that he was acting under instructions from the association or that the association was formed for the purpose of committing these acts. Upon the contrary, all the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause tends to show that the association was formed with the high and noble purpose of ""teaching the workmen not only the necessary fulfillment of their duties, but as well the beautiful knowledge of how to discreetly and opportunely exercise their sacred rights in every field."" 


We are not of the opinion that the alleged illegal acts of an officer of an association can be imputed to the association, for the purpose of showing that the purposes and objects for which the association was organized were illicit and contrary to public morals. 


A great portion of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause was evidently adduced for the purpose of showing the irregular administration of the funds of said association and the alleged fraudulent investment of the same for purposes other than those contemplated by the by-laws of said association. This irregular administration of the funds of the association might constitute the crime of 
estafa
. Upon that question, however, we make no finding, for the reason that 
estafa
 is not the crime charged in the present complaint. 


Upon the question of the sufficiency of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause in the lower court, we have made a careful examination of the same, and while there is much proof, judging from the acts of the defendant, to lend suspicion to the character and purpose of the association organized, directed, and presided over by the defendant, and much suspicious proof relating to the conduct of the defendant in connection therewith, and considerable proof indicating that the defendant used said association to advance his own political interest, as well as to better his financial condition, and also a good deal of proof tending to show that the defendant was personally in intimate relations with some of the enemies of the Government, yet, notwithstanding this, we are of the opinion and so hold, that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause is insufficient to support the charges set forth in the complaint filed in said cause — 


(1) 	Because none of the proofs sufficiently demonstrate that the object and purpose of the association referred to were contrary to public morals, or that it was the intention of said association to commit any of the crimes punished by the Penal Code. 


(2) 	Because, even if it were possible, under article 189, paragraph 1, for one person to be responsible as the founder, director, or president of an illegal association, he would be responsible only as such founder, etc., when such association was contrary to public morals or had for its object the commission of any of the crimes punished by the Penal Code. 


(3) 	Because, even though the founder, director, or president of such association may have had an illegal purpose in view in the founding of the same, yet such illegal purpose on his part alone could not affect the object and nature of the association itself or the lawful end and real purpose of the same. Article 188 of the Penal Code penalizes the illicit purpose of the association, and not the end or object which its founder, director, or president may hope to realize under the shadow of the association. If in the management of the association he commits a crime, he may be punished in accordance with his acts, but not under the provisions of said article 188. 


For these reasons the sentence of the lower court is hereby reversed and the defendant is hereby absolved, with costs de oficio. So ordered.
