Under date of July 16, 1963, respondent Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc. filed a manifestation to the effect that the purpose of this case for 
certiorari
 is to prevent the eviction of petitioner Arsenic Veluz from the premises involved in Civil Case No. 96678 of the Municipal Court of Manila entitled Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc. vs. Arsenic Veluz, etc., later appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 50962) and ultimately to the Court of Appeals (C.A.-G.R. No. 01295-R), that in the month of May, 1963, petitioner herein — defendant in the case already mentioned — vacated the leased premises without paying to the lessor or depositing in court the March to May, 1963 rentals; that the appeal interposed by him in the Court of Appeals was dismissed on July 9, 1963 for his failure to file his brief.
