R E S O L U T I O N


DIZON, 
J.:


It appears that counsel for petitioners were served with notice of our resolution of April 30, 1963, on May 10 of the present year. On the 22nd of the same month, Attys. Ozaeta, Gibbs & Ozaeta made of record their appearance as counsel for petitioner company, as well as for James McKeen, the special administrator of the estate of petitioner Werner P. Schetelig, whose death they made of record.


We have now before us (1) a motion filed by said attorneys on behalf of the aforenamed special administrator, praying for the dismissal of this case in so far as the deceased Werner P. Schetelig and/or his estate is concerned, or that the estate of said deceased be granted a period of at least twenty (20) days from notice within which to file a motion for reconsideration or take other legal remedies proper and available to the estate, and (2) another motion of the same attorneys praying that petitioner company be granted an extension of twenty (20) days from May 25, 1963 within which to file a motion for reconsideration or take other action proper and available in the premises.


The motion for the dismissal of the case as far as it concerns the now deceased petitioner Werner P. Schetelig is denied for lack of merit.


On the other hand, the motions mentioned above being meritorious as far as the extension prayed for is concerned, said petitioners are hereby granted a period of twenty (20) days from notice hereof within which to file a motion for reconsideration of our resolution of April 30, 1963 or to seek whatever legal remedy may to them seem proper.


Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Paredes, Regala and Makalintal, JJ., concur.

Wherefore, the parties respectfully pray that the foregoing stipulation of facts be admitted and approved by this Honorable Court, without prejudice to the parties adducing other evidence to prove their case not covered by this stipulation of facts.
