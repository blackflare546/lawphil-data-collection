PADILLA, 
J.:


For the building of a service station at Cubao Quezon City, the Standard-Vacuum Oil Company engaged the services of Jose Cabigao as a contractor who hired the plaintiffs as carpenters, masons and laborers to work on the construction. The contractor had been paid in full for the construction of the station by the Standard-Vacuum Oil Company but has not paid fully the wages of the artisans for work performed by them from 1 November to 2 December 1948. For such failure the artisans brought an action in the Municipal Court of Manila to recover from contractor and the company the sum of P1,264.50, lawful interest and costs. The company having raised the point of unconstitutionality of Act No. 959 upon which the artisans rely to recover their due and unpaid wages, the Municipal Court forwarded the case to the Court of First Instance.


Upon a stipulation of facts which reads , as follows:




Come now plaintiffs and defendant Standard-Vacuum Oil Company, by their respective undersigned attorneys, and to this Honorable Court respectfully submit the following stipulations:
