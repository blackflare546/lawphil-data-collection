My commission expires on December 31,1948




Concepcion Ramos died on August 19, 1948, leaving a will dated January 7, 1927 admitted to probate on October 4, 1948, in which she ordered that the credits due to her be distributed among the children of the deceased Antonino Ramos, namely, Consolacion, Ramon, Socorro and Cirila.


One year before she died, Concepcion Ramos filed with the War Damage Commission a claim which was identified as No. 411773. On August 31, 1948, the Commission issued check No. 348444, in the amount of P501.62, payable to the deceased Concepcion Ramos. This check was returned to the Commission and substituted by the latter which check No. 564614, on November 10, 1948, for the same amount, but payable to Benigno A. Caoibes, who had presented to said entity Annexes ""A"" and ""B"", above mentioned, in order to exchange the first check No. 564614, which he cashed for himself.


Annexes ""A"" and ""B"" were presented to the Commission by Caoibes after the death of Concepcion. The administratrix, Consolacion L. Ramos, the appellant herein, discovered the collection made by Caoibes when she saw the note ""previous payment"" which appeared in the account sent to her by the Commission on October 13, 1950. She filed a motion with the court asking that Caoibes be ordered to deposit the sum of P501.62 with the clerk of court. Caoibes answered the motion admitting that after the death of Concepcion, he presented Annexes ""A"" and ""B"" to the Commission and received in cash the sum of P501.62, amount of the second check, above mentioned, but stating that he was willing to deliver to the clerk the sum of P250.81. He contended that, by virtue of Annex ""A"", and Annex ""B"", he had the right to retain, for himself, half of the sum of P501.62.


The court below issued the following order:


Considering the motion of the administratrix praying that Atty. Benigno A. Caoibes turn over the amount of P510.62, representing war damage claim, to the office of the Clerk of this Court, and the answer of Atty. Caoibes to the said motion and this Court having had the opportunity to personally confer with the parties and Atty. Caoibes being agreeable to turn over the amount of P250.81 to the Clerk of this Court in final settlement of this matter — it is ordered that the said Atty. Caoibes deposit the said amount to be at the disposal of the administratrix and the other parties in this intestate proceedings. With this order, the matter before this Court is deemed closed.


SO ORDERED


Batangas, Batangas, June 15, 1951






(Sgd.) E. SORIANO

         
Judge








On July 3, 1951, the administratrix filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the order of the court dated July 12, 1951. (In the printed Record on Appeal the date appears to be July 12, 1950, but it is evidently a mistake and it should be July 12, 1951.)


We will now proceed to consider the two documents.


Annex A is only a power of attorney. Caoibes, as agent, had the obligation to deliver the amount collected by virtue of said power to his principal, Concepcion, or, after her death, to the administratrix of her estate, Consolacion. There is absolutely no cession of rights made in favor of Caoibes in Annex ""A"", and under Article 1711 of the old Civil Code (which was in force at the time of the transaction), the contract of agency is presumed to be gratuitous, unless the agent is a professional agent. There is no proof that Caoibes was such. Furthermore, according to Article 1732 of said Code, an agency is terminated, among other causes, by the death of the principal or of the agent. When Caoibes made use of the power of attorney, his principal, Concepcion was already dead.


Coming now to Annex ""B"", the alleged document of donation, it should be noted that it is not a donation of real but of personal property and is governed by article 632 of the old Civil Code, which reads as follows:


Donations of personal property may be made verbally or in writing.


Verbal donation requires the simultaneous delivery of the gift. In the absence of this requisite the donation shall produce no effect, unless made in writing and accepted in the same form.


The alleged donation was made in writing but it has not been accepted in the same form, and consequently, has no validity. It cannot be considered a donation upon valuable consideration, for no services nor any valuable consideration had passed from the donees to the donor. The mere fact that Caoibes collected the claim from the War Damage Commission is not such a service as to require compensation. Caoibes did not even prepare the claim.


The court below in its order of June 15, 1951, said that it ""having had the opportunity to personally confer with the parties and Attorney Caoibes being agreeable to turn over the amount of P250.81 to the Clerk of this Court in final settlement of this matter — it is ordered that the said Atty. Caoibes deposit the amount of P250.81 with the Clerk of this Court, the said amount to be at the disposal of the administratrix and the other parties in these intestate proceedings. With this order, the matter before the administratrix never consented to the reduction of the claim.


In view of the foregoing, the order appealed from is hereby reversed and Benigno A. Caoibes is ordered to deposit with the Clerk of Court of Batangas the sum of P501.62 to be at the disposal of the administratrix in her capacity as such, without pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.
