Petition for review of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in WC Case No. RPO-A-6471 promulgated on October 2, 1975. 


On December 27, 1957, respondent-claimant Ruben Napisa (hereinafter referred to as claimant) was employed by the petitioner as the manager of its refrigeration, air conditioning and service department with a monthly salary of P2,000.00. While acting as such, claimant suffered cerebral thrombosis on August 10, 1973. This was followed by a cerebral stroke on October 1, 1973 which necessitated his confinement at the Marian Hospital from November 3 to November 9, 1973 and at the Medical Center, Manila from November 9 to November 23, 1973 when he died to continue his treatment at home until December 3, 1973. On the latter date he was again confined at the Medical Center, Manila for further treatment as his ailment worsened with the paralyzation of the right side of his body. 


On January 15, 1974, claimant filed his claim for compensation benefits, Petitioner controverted the claim alleging that claimant's illness did not arise out of his employment nor was the same aggravated by the nature; of his work. 


On February 14, 1974, an award was entered by the Chief of Unit, Rizal Provincial Office, Department of labor, the dispositive portion of which reads: 
ñé+.£ªwph!1




AWARD, therefore, is hereby rendered and the respondent is directed: 


1)	I.To pay the claimant, thru this Office, the sum of four thousand two hundred ninety-two pesos and 40/100 (P4,292.40) representing the compensation which has accrued to date and beginning February 14, 1974, a weekly compensation of P219,32 until his disability for labor ceases but not exceeding six thousand pesos P6,000.00), including the lump sutn payment.


2)	To extend or continue extending to claimant such necessary medical services and supplies as the nature of his illness and the process of his recovery may require and that which will promote his eari restoration to the maximum level of his physical capacity and should respondent fail on this regard claimant may secure such medical services and supplier at respondent's expense; and


3)	To pay to the Workmen's Compensation Fund, likewise thrill this Office, the sum of P43.00 as partial administrative fee, pursuant to Section 55 of the Act. Bill No. W- 2055074 RPO is attached. 




Upon motion for reconsideration by the claimant, the Chief of Unit issued an order on March 7, 1974 raising the reimbursement for medical expenses to P37,713.25 out of the claim of P44,004.29. Petitioner moved for a reconsideration of said order of March 7, 1974 but the motion was denied by the order of May 3, 1974. The same order granted the motion of the claimant filed on February 19. 1974 seeking to implead as party-respondent the Philippine British Assurance Co., Inc. and/or Ker & Co., Ltd., as the insurer of petitioner's compensation liability and accordingly held the latter and the petitioner jointly and severally liable to the claimant.


On June 10, 1974, upon payment of the sum of P15,000.00, the claimant assisted by his counsel, executed a ""Full Satisfaction of Insurance Carrier's Liability on,the Order of This office dated November 3, 1974."" This was; however declared as null and void by the order of the Chief of Unit February 8, 1974. Subsequently, the records of the case were etevata to the Workmen's Compensation Commission for review and the same were referred to the Evaluation Division for evaluation of the fair and reasonable value of the medical expenses incurred by the claimant. In the meantime, on September 9, 1974, the claimant and his wife executed a ""Deed of Release and Quitclaim"" upon receipt of payment from the petitioner the sum of P21,000.00 exclusive of the P15,000.00 earlier paid by the insurance carrier. On September 18, 1974. both the petitioner and the claimant filed with the respondent Commission, an ""Amicable Settlement"" wherein it was prayed that this case be dismissed in view of the full and complete satisfaction of the claim for compensation. This was not, however, acted upon by the respondent Commission. 


On October 2, 1975, the respondent Commission rendered its decision, the dispositive Portion of which, reads: 
ñé+.£ªwph!1




WHEREFORE, subject to the modification hereinabove initiated the alard dated February 14, 1974 as amended, should be in it is AFFIRMED. Respondents Williams Equipment Co., alI the Philippine Bristish Assurance Co., Inc. and/or Ker & Co., to jointly and literally:


1.	The complainant thru this Commission, the amount of SIX THOUSAND (6,000.00) PESOS as compensation plus the amount of TWENTY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SNEN PESOS and 30/100 P21,327.30) as of illegal expenses or a total of TWENTY SEVEN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND (P27,327.30) for which shall be deducted the FIFTEEN THOUSAND 15,000) PESOS thereby alaiice of TWELVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN PESOS and 30/100 (Pl2,327.30);


2.	To claimants counsel, Mr. Bienvenido R. Raton the amount of SIX HUNDRED (P600.00) PESOS as attorney's fee section 31 of the act;


3.	To the workmen's Compensation Fund the amount of SIXTY SIX (P66.00) PESOS as administrative cost including the P5.00 fee for this review pursuant to Section 55 of the Act; and 


4.	Respondent shall further provide the claimant with said appliances and supplies as the nature of his total process of his recovery may require; and that which will promote his early restoration to the maximum level of his physical capacity. 


SO ORDERED. 




Petitioner now seeks a review of the said decision on the ground that the same was rendered without jurisdiction and is therefore, null and void. lt is contended that since the parties herein had already entered into an amicable settlement, the claim for compensation is already extinguished for there was no more basis for the respondent Commission to render the decision in question. 


It is undisputed that after having been impleaded as partyrespondent, the Philippine British Assurance Co., Inc., and/or Ker & Co., Ltd.. as insurer of Petitioner's compensation liability, paid to the claimant the amount of P15,000.00 on June 10, 1974 which the latter acknowledged as full satisfaction of the insurance carrier's liability. Likewise, on September 9, 1974, claimant received from the petitioner the sum of P21,000.00 for which the former executed a Deed of Release and Quitclaim."" As a result thereof, the parties submitted an amicable settlement to the respondent Commission wherein it was prayed that this case be dismissed. Claimant has thus received from the petitioner and the insurance carrier, the total amount of P36,000.00 for his claim In its decision, the respondent Commission awarded to the claimant P6,000.00 as compensation plus the amount of P21,327.30 as reimbursement for medical expenses or a total of P27,327.30 from which was deducted the P15,000.00 paid by the petitioner's insurance carrier, leaving a balance of P12,327.30. We find this to be erroneous as the respondent Commission failed to credit the amount of P21,000.00 paid by the petitioner to the claimant on September 9, 1974. While is true that the respondent Commission could not have acted upon the amicable settlement submitted by the parties in accordance with Section 29 of the Workmen's Compensation Act. 
1
 because the same failed to mention the terms of the settlement, nevertheless, on October 23, 1975, the petitioner filed a manifestation alleging that the amicable settlement submitted was the result of the payment by the petitioner to the claimant of the sum of P21,000.00 for which the latter executed a ""Deed of Release and Quitclaim"" and a certification that said amount is exclusive of the P15,000.00 paid by the insurance carrier and that by virtue thereof, it has already satisfied the judgment of the respondent Comiission. Attached to the said manifestation were the documents adverted to. In effect, said manifestation was a submission for approval of the agreement (amicable settlement) concerning compensation and the respondent Commission should not have ignored the same. Under the circumstances, petitioner should be credited with the payment to the claimant of the sum of P21,000.00. Adding to the said amount the P15,000.00 paid by the insurance carrier, the claimant has received a total of P36,000.00 for his claim. In its decision, the respondent Commission has awarded to the claimant the aggregate sum of P27,327.30 (P6,000.00 for compensation and P21,327.30 for reimbursement of medical expenses). Deducting the award of P27,327.30 from the P36,000.00 received by the claimant from the petitioner as compensation benefits there is a difference of P8,672.70 which is the excess of what is due the claimant under the decision of the respondent Commission. Under Section 29 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, in order that an agreement concerning compensation may be valid, two conditions must be complied: (1) the amount agreed upon must be at least equal to that provided by the Act; and (b) the agreement must be approved by the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner or his duly author representative. The settlement of compensation cases is further provided for under Letter of Instruction No. 190 dated June 3, 1974 
2
 and under Department Order No. 3, series of 1974 of the Department of Labor. 
3
 Since the total amount received by the claimant from the petitioner (including that paid by the latter's insurance canier) in settlement of his claim is riot only equal but even more than what is provided under the Workmen's Compensation Act, there is no valid for the respondent Commission not to act and give its stamp of approval to the amicable settlement submitted by the parties. 


ACCORDINGLY, the decision of the respondent Common is hereby affirmed with the qualification that the award for compensation in the amount of P6,000.00 and the reimbursement for medical expenses in the sum of P21,327.30 have been fully satisfied by the petitioner.


SO ORDERED.
