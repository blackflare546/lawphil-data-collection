On June 4, 1965, Teresita Banzuela of Quezon Street, Dipolog, Zamboanga del Norte filed a verified complaint charging Atty. Jose C. Tabiliran, Jr. (admitted to the bar in 1964) with having failed to fulfill his promise to marry her.


Miss Banzuela, an eighteen-year old third year student of Saint Vincent's College, alleged that on the strength of respondent's promise to marry her, she surrendered her virtue and that she was in the family way.


The respondent answered the complaint in compliance with this Court's resolution of July 19, 1965. However, for unknown reasons, his answer has not been attached to the record up to this time.


The respondent in his motion to dismiss dated September 9, 1977 alleged that on March 7, 1966 he and the complainant were in the church of Saint Francis Xavier located at Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte. He enclosed a certified copy of the marriage certificate. He prayed that the instant case be dismissed. 


WHEREFORE, this case is dropped and considered closed. 


SO ORDERED. 


Barredo, Antonio, Concepcion, Jr. and Santos, JJ., concur.
