A notice of appeal 
2
 having been filed for both accused by their counsel, the records were erroneously transmitted to the Court of Appeals 
3
 which forwarded the same to this Court. 
4
 


On March 18, 1969, before the brief for the appellants was filed, Sergio Nicolas withdrew his appeal for the reason that he wanted ""to enjoy the privileges of a sentence (d) prisoner and to be entitled to any form of executive clemency"". 
5
 The withdrawal was granted in a Resolution dated March 27, 1969. 
6
 Thus, this review pertains to the appeal of the accused-appellant Domingo Pascual only. 


The evidence adduced at the trial show that in the morning of December 29, 1964, Odarlico Sotero requested the two accused, Domingo Pascual and Sergio Nicolas, to accompany him to Bo. Namagbagan to buy a goat, which he intended to slaughter on New Year's eve The two acceded to the request; and they actually proceeded to the said barrio. But instead of accomplishing their purpose, they ended up spending the day taking drinks in stores along their way.

When they finally to go home in the afternoon, they met an Igorot selling medicinal herbs. Odarlico asked the Igorot if the latter had medicine for nervousness. The Igorot did not understand Odarlico so he, the Igorot, asked Odarlico what he meant. Odarlico got irritated. He held the Igorot by the collar and slapped his face. He then searched the pocket of the Igorot and got the latter's money. When the Igorot meekly asked Odarlico why he took his money, Odarlico denied having taken the same and started boxing the Igorot. Several persons arrived and tried to stop Odarlico but their efforts were in vain. An old man, finally, sent a boy to call for the barrio captain. 
8


Meanwhile, Alfredo Sotero and the other barrio councilmen were about to hold a council meeting at the house of the barrio captain. When the boy arrived at the house and informed the councilmen of the incident between Odarlico and the Igorot, Alfredo and his co-councilmen repaired to the place. They saw the Igorot crying while Odarlico and his two companions, Domingo and Sergio, were sitting by the side of the road. Alfredo asked the Igorot why he was crying. The Igorot replied that Odarlico boxed him and took his money. Alfredo then confronted Odarlico but the latter denied having taken the money. The Igorot then informed Alfredo that the money was in the pocket of Odarlico When Alfredo was about to search the pocket of Odarlico the latter grudgingly drew the money from his pocket and threw it to Alfredo. Alfredo asked Odarlico if he was angry. Odarlico angrily replied ""You son of . . ., you are minding things you do not even see and, instantaneously, slapped the face of Alfredo. This angered Alfredo and the two took a fighting stance. At this juncture, two sons of Alfredo, with bamboo poles in hand, came to the aid of their father. They were however, pacified by the people around them. ""redo then told the companions of Odarlico Domingo and Sergio, to go home. 
9
 


The following morning news spread that Odarlico Sotero was dead. his body was found lying on the ground, face down, lifeless in an isolated spot not far from the house of Alfredo Sotero. 
10
 At about 10:00 o'clock that Municipal Health Officer, Dr. Benjamin K. Calderon by Sanitary Inspector Tomas Molina and Patrolman Francisco Mariano and Andres Naval, repaired to Bo. Pitombayog where they found the dead body of Odarlico 
11
 Dr. Calderon examined the body and made an autopsy report,

	 				 Mayantoc, Tarlac 




According to Dr. Calderon's testimony, the approximate time of Odarlico's death was seventeen (17) hours prior to his examination. He attributed the death to injuries caused by a blunt instrument. 
13
 


Because Domingo and Sergio were the last persons seen with Odarlico the day previous, Patrolmen Mariano and Naval apprehended the two and brought them to the municipal building that very same morning. In the course of the investigation by the police authorities, the two accused executed sworn statements admitting the commission of the crime. The material and relevant portion of Sergio's statement follows

The prosecution tried to prove that the statements were executed voluntarily; the two accused vehemently denied the same and testified that their statements were extracted thru protracted investigation, intimidation and maltreatment. 


On the basis of the affidavits signed by the two accused containing their alleged extrajudicial confessions according to which the two accused killed the victim by striking Odarlico's head with a bamboo pole when he threatened to kill them because they refused to burn the 
mandala
 of Asiong Labonete the trial court convicted both accused and sentenced them to fife imprisonment as adverted to above. 


In the brief filed on June 6, 1969 by appellant's counsel de oficio 
16
 
I the acquittal of the appellant is sought on the following grounds: (1) that the extrajudicial confession is not admissible in evidence for being involuntary; and (2) that, even if the same were admissible, it is not sufficient to establish appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. To this submission, the Solicitor General, 
17
 representing the People concurs and concludes ""that the guilt of the appellant of the crime of murder of which he has been charged had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.
18
 
The People's counsel argues that - (1) there is no direct evidence whatsoever linking the appellant to the death of Odarlico Sotero outside of his own admission; (2) that there exists no evidence with respect to the ill motive of both appellant and Sergio Nicolas against the deceased; (3) that it would appear on the other hand that there are other persons who might have the motive to kill Odarlico and, finally (4) that in the case at bar, there is no clear cut showing that appellant is guilty of the charge for which he has been convicted, considering the following: 
ñé+.£ªwph!1




(1)	 It is undisputed that there was no previous Misunderstanding between the accused and the deceased. In fact the three were together during the whole day upon invitation of the deceased to buy a goat. 


(2) 	It is hard to believe that simply because the two accused demurred to the suggestion of the deceased to burn the piles of palay of one Asiong Labonete would be enough to arouse the feeling of the deceased to the extent of threatening them with death. 


(3) 	And there is no reason why the accused (Domingo Pascual and Sergio Nicolas) would be afraid of the supposed threat of the deceased Odarlico Sotero when there is no indication that the latter was armed for certainly he was of no match to the two accused. 


(4) 	The accused could have easily avoided the alleged threat of the deceased by the simple expedience of waiting for the deceased to go over the barbwire fence and running away on the opposite direction. 


(5) 	According to the affidavit of accused Sergio Nicolas, they followed the order of Ordarlico Sotero but in the affidavit of appellant, they did not follow the suggestion of Odarlico 


(6) 	The finding of the bamboo pole in the place allegedly indicated by the accused is not significant, as erroneously found by the trial Court, for the same could be secured by anyon	e who is interested in pinning authorship of the crime to the accused.


(7) 	Alfredo Sotero or anyone did not in anyway whatsoever refute the testimony of the appellant and Sergio that there was an altercation between the deceased and Alfredo Sotero, and that the latter and his two sons were the last persons with the deceased before he was killed. 
19
 




A careful consideration of the trial court's rationale for its finding of guilt of the herein accused, 
viz a viz
, the submissions of the 
counsel de oficio 
and the Solicitor General, who recommends appellant's acquittal, the questions raised in this appeal may be synthesized for logical treatment as follow: 


1.	Was the extrajudicial statement of the accused, which, along with the proof of 
corpus delicti
, is the sole basis for his conviction, executed voluntarily as the trial court held; or not, as the appellant thru 
counsel de oficio 
and the appellee, thru the Solicitor General, claim? 


2.	Assuming that the said extrajudicial statement was executed voluntarily, is the same, coupled with the proof of 
corpus delicti
, sufficient to establish appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt? and, 


3.	What is the significance of the existence of probable motives on the part of other persons 
i.e
 the Igorot and Alfredo Sotero, barrio councilman to kill Odarlico on the guilt of innocence of the accused appellant? 


Now to resolve the foregoing questions- 


1.	On whether the accused-appellant's extrajudicial confession is voluntary or not. The trial court concluded that the same was executed voluntarily because - (1) the affidavits contain details which could not have been supplied or invented by the police and which could have been given only by the accused themselves; (2) the same were taken by the Chief of Police of Mayantoc and subscribed and sworn to before the Municipal Judge, both public officials in whose favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duties may be indulged; (3) when the written statements of the two were taken in the Office of the Chief of Police at the ground floor of the municipal building of Mayantoc, the windows were open and there were several persons inside and outside the same (4) if the two were maltreated by the policeman in the manner and during the length of time alleged by them they must have suffered serious injuries and must have been totally disabled, which were not the case when they were brought before the municipal judge to subscribe and swear to their affidavits; (5) the maltreatment was denied by Patrolman Naygan and Cpl. Maximo Jara of the Force of Mayantoc; and family (6) the finding of the police of the bamboo pole, Exhibit ""D"", mentioned in the affidavits of both accused as having been used to kill the victim at the precise place one of them, clearly shows that the statements were made by them and were not invented by the police. 


Appellant, thru 
counsel de oficio
, in his Brief, on the other hand, argues- that the two-page statement consisting of 25 short questions and answers took three hours to complete, suggesting that there has been unrecorded questions and answers and harassment of the appellant in the hands of his investigators; (2) that the detail mentioned in the confession, namely, the bamboo pole allegedly used to kill the victim, is not of sufficient importance to render as corroborated an otherwise uncorroborated confession, for bamboo Poles are very common in rural areas; (3) that the only other detail in the confession which could have come from the appellant is the existence of rice stalks belonging to Asiong Labonete, but no independent evidence was introduced to establish the existence of such rice stalks (4) the two confessions contradict each other, because while the appellant stated that they did not burn the rice stalks (Exh. ""B"", Answer No. 15), Sergio Nicolas said that they burned the same (Exh. ""A"", Answer No. 13); (5) that the trial court found that the appellant accompanied Patrolman Victor Lardizabal to retrieve the bamboo pole allegedly used to kill the victim, but this finding of fact is belied completely by the prosecution's own evidence since Lardizabal testified that it was Sergio Nicolas whom he accompanied to the river bank to retrieve the bamboo Pole; and (6) that the trial court erred in giving weight to the testimonies of prosecution witnesses. 
20
 


The Solicitor General in turn observes that the trial court capitalized on the supposed extrajudicial confession, which was vehemently denounced by the appellant and his co-accused as procured through force, violence and intimidation; (2) that accused's denial was timely since they did not have the opportunity to denounce their torturers while confined in the municipal jail; and, (3) that it was only after appellant was transferred to the Provincial jail, after three weeks 
21
 of confinement in the municipal jail, that he had the opportunity to confide the matter to his brothers and sisters who then advised him to disclose the truth of his maltreatment. 
22
 


Since the conviction of the herein accused, is premised solely on his extrajudicial confession coupled with proof of 
corpus delicti
, the voluntary character of said confession must be established by evidence beyond cavil of doubt. For if the voluntariness of the confession were in any manner to be subject to doubt, the confession cannot support the conviction in this case. 


The rule is well settled that ""the trial court's findings win be sustained unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence which has been overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted"". 
23
 
In the case of 
People v. Villaroya
, We held that the trial court's findings must not be disturbed unless (a) the record shows that some facts or circumstances of weight or influence have been overlooked, or (b) the significance of which has been misinterpreted, or (c) some conclusion established from the facts is inconsistent with these findings, or (d) there is some inherent weakness in the evidence upon which the conclusion is based. 
24


The records reveal, however, that there are facts and circumstances which the trial court overlooked or the significance of which it failed to appreciate, which place in doubt its reliance on the sworn statement as voluntary and as sole basis for its finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt of a very serious offense-murder.


a.	The trial court concluded that the extrajudicial statement of the appellant was voluntarily executed for the reason, among others, that the statement contained details which could not have been supplied or invented by the police and which could have been given by the accused only. 
25
 However, a thorough scrutiny of appellant's statement would show that the details concerning the place where and the time when the crime was committed, the manner of its commission, and the incidents attendant thereto, have been known, or could have easily been known, to the policemen who conducted the investigation. For it is a matter of record that the police authorities were well aware, before the statements were taken, where the body of the deceased was found, the manner of his death, and the approximate time when he was killed, because an investigation was conducted by them at the scene where the body of the victim was found, and the autopsy was performed in their presence. 
26
 


b.	The trial court failed to note and/or did not attach significance to the fact that the two accused made diametrically conflicting assertions with respect to whether the hay stack of Labonete was indeed burned by them. Accused-appellant in his statement said that 
they did not
 burn the 
mandala
; whereas, SergioNicolas, who withdrew his appeal. maintained that they did. 
27
 


c.	Again the lower court failed to note that the statements in the affidavits of the two accused, with respect to the manner in which they hit Odarlico with the bamboo pole, are inconsistent with the findings of the Medical Officer as to the wounds and bruises sustained by him. While the affidavits state that each of the accused beat Odarlico two times at the head, 
28
 
Dr. Calderon, in his Necropsy Report and in his testimony, states that the deceased suffered wounds and bruises in other parts of his body. 
29
 


d.	Finally, the trial court found- 
ñé+.£ªwph!1




Because Sergio Nicolas mentioned in his affidavit that the bamboo pole used in killing Odarlico was thrown by Domingo Pascual at the side of a river, Chief of Police Cruz ordered policemen Victor Lardizabal to accompany 
Domingo Pascual
 in going to Sitio Cabaruan in order to retrieve the said bamboo pole. That was on the morning of December 31, 1964. The duo rode in a pick-up vehicle and upon reaching Sitio Cabaruan, they proceeded to a place beside a river where, according to 
Pascual
, he threw the bamboo pole. After searching the place, Lardizabal found that object, picked it up and then asked this the bamboo and 
Pascual
 answered: Yes, sir . . . 
30




This material corroborative detail must have induced the trial court's finding of appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, since it would appear that appellant's extrajudicial confession was indeed corroborated by a very significant fact, namely, 
the finding of the bamboo pole, allegedly utilized in killing the victim, at the precise place allegedly pointed to by accused-appellant himself


The truth of the matter, however, is that it was not appellant Domingo Pascual who was accompanied by Patrolman Lardizabal to the place where the bamboo pole was found, nor. was Pascual the one who retrieved the bamboo pole. By testimony of Patrolman Lardizabal himself, it was Sergio Nicolas whom he accompanied to the place to retrieve the bamboo pole, thus - 
ñé+.£ªwph!1




xxx			xxx			xxx
ñé+.£ªwph!1




Q	Upon reaching that place beside the river, what did you do? 


A	We searched for the piece of bamboo, sir, which he used in hitting the victim. 


Q	when you said ""we"" are you referring to the accused Sergio Nicolas 


A	Yes, sir.


Q	Were you able to find the bamboo? 


A 	Yes, sir. 


Q	How did you happen to find the bamboo pole? 


A	We were able to locate the bamboo because he told me where he threw the bamboo. 
31
 








The foregoing facts and circumstances i.e., (1) that the details were or could easily have been known to the police investigators; (2) the contradicting testimonies over a very significant matter, whether the mandala was burned or not; and (3) the presence of wounds and bruises in other parts of Odalrico's body which were overlooked, or the significance of which the trial court failed to appreciate, place in serious doubt its finding that the statement is voluntary. And the trial court's mistake in its finding that it was appellant who was accompanied by Pat. Lardizabal to the place where the bamboo pole was thrown, belies an important corroborative detail, thus leaving the statement as the only basis, with proof of 
corpus delicti
 of course, for appellant's conviction for a very serious offense involving a sentence of life imprisonment. 


2.	Now on the sufficiency of the extrajudicial statement. On this question, the Solicitor General maintains that the extrajudicial confession on its face does not inspire belief, He contends that there was no previous misunderstanding between the accused and the deceased; in fact, the three were together the whole day upon the invitation of Odarlico to buy a goat; (2) that it is hard to believe that simply because the accused demurred to Odalrico's suggestion to bum Labonete's 
mandala
, the same will be enough to arouse the feeling of Odarlico to the extent of threatening them with death; (3) that there is no reason why appellant and Sergio Nicolas would be afraid of Odarlico who was unarmed and was no match to the two; and (4) that the accused could have easily avoided the alleged threat of the deceased by running away. 
32
 


These observations are well-taken. The confession to serve as a basis for conviction must inspire credibility. It must not be improbable or excite disbelief. It must be one which the normal experience of mankind can accept as within the realm of probability. The statement which ascribes to two youthful rural folk, a serious criminal design to kill someone against whom they entertain no ill will over a flimsy cause-refusal to bum a mandala, when they could have easily escaped or ran away simply flies in the face of truth. 


3.	On the existence of probable motives on the part of other persons to kill Odarlico The statements of both accused adverted to the quarrel between Odarlico and the Igorot and immediately thereafter between Alfredo and Odarlico the accused both testified in great detail about these incidents 
33
 leading Us to believe, as contended by the Solicitor General, that these persons could have probable motives to kill Odarlico On the other hand, it is admitted that the accused were investigated solely on account of their having been seen with Odarlico on the afternoon of the day he was killed. The records do not show that any investigation was conducted to verify whether other persons could have been responsible for the death of Odarlico for example, the Igorot and Alfredo. And Alfredo did not rebut the testimonies of the two accused as to the incident which involved his allegedly being slapped by Odarlico and that his two sons had to come to his aid with bamboo poles.


These circumstances show how superficial indeed were the efforts on the part of the police force to ferret out the true culprit; how, as is the wont of police investigators, the death of Odarlico was investigated in perfunctory and cavalier fashion, and, as claimed by the accused, without regard to their rights act of self -incrimination That these could regrettably be the case is home by Our experience in many instances. 
34
 
Recent examples are the celebrated cases of the Imperious father and son, who were investigated, then tortured and made to confess their guilt by members of the police force simply because they were 
""the last persons seen with the victim;""
 
35
 and that of Isidro buscato Nestor Dalud and Jabib Tan who were investigated, then tortured and also made to confess their guilt because they""... Rodolfo Lim because they were reportedly deceased with the previous night. . ."" 
36
 


The presence of other person who could have probable motive to kill Odarlico but who were not investigated raise serious doubts on the findings of the police investigators that appellant was one of the perpetrators of the killing. This is especially so where there is no shred of evidence offered by the prosecution to support appellant's guilt, except his bare statement, the due and voluntary execution of which he vehemently denied. 


In resume, (1) the uncertainty as to the voluntariness of the confession; (2) the improbability of the version as contained in the extrajudicial confession; (3) the failure of the police authorities to conduct a thorough and careful investigation of the circumstances leading to the death of Odarlico and the existence of motive on the part of others to kill Odarlico and, finally, (4) the erroneous finding of the trial court that appellant was the one who showed and retrieved the bamboo pole-are the facts and circumstances of weight and influence which all together cast serious doubt on the guilt of herein accused-appellant of the crime charged. He is, therefore, entitled to acquittal. 


WHEREFORE, the judgment of conviction is hereby REVERSED and the appellant, DOMINGO PASCUAL, is ACQUITTED of the Charge, with cost tie oficio.
