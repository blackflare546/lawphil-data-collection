The Court of Appeals, in a resolution promulgated on March 19, 1966 certified to the Supreme Court the case because ""the value of the property in question is more than half a million pesos ..."" hence ""is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court.""

On February 1, 1960 Benedicto M. Javier, as administrator of the Estate of Eusebio Cruz, instituted against Dominga Vda. de Cruz and her children Civil Case No. 5996 to declare null and void a deed of sale of a part of a parcel of land located in Barrio San Isidro, Taytay, Rizal containing an area of 182,959 square meters and assessed at P4,310.00 under Tax No. 9136 under Tax No. 9136 in the name of Estate of E. Cruz. 


The amended complaint stated that Eusebio Cruz, who died on February 2, 1941 at the age of 100 years without leaving any will nor compulsory heirs, was the absolute and exclusive owner of a parcel of mountainous and unimproved land situated in sitio Matogalo, Taytay, Rizal which he inherited from his forebears, described therein; that during his lifetime, Eusebio Cruz had been living with one Teodora Santos 'without the sanction of marriage""; that Teodora Santos had with her as distant relatives and protegees the brothers Gregorio Cruz and Justo Cruz; that Gregorio Cruz was the father of Delfin Cruz, deceased husband of defendant Dominga Vda. de Cruz and father of defendants Leonila, Roman, Eliseo, Leberata and Melecio, all surnamed Cruz; that on January 16, 1941 Delfin Cruz, by means of deceit and in collusion with persons among them his father Gregorio Cruz made Eusebio Cruz, who could read and write, stamp his thumbmark on a deed of sale of a portion of the land described in the complaint consisting of 26,577 square meters for the sum of P700.00 in favor of said Delfin Cruz; that at that time Delfin Cruz did not have theithin thirty days from submittal of the case for decision, but the validity of the law cannot be seriously challenged.""

Petitioner fiscal, as already stated, filed the informations in the ten cases with the Circuit Criminal Court rather than with the respondent judge's court to mitigate the latter court's caseload in accordance with the purpose of the Circuit Criminal Court law or at the request of the offended parties and complainants. Since the filing of the information or complaint ""supplies -the occasion for the exercise of jurisdiction vested by law in a particular court"" 
15
 and the law confers concurrent jurisdiction in the Circuit Criminal Court, the said court properly assumed jurisdiction over the said cases and there is no lawful basis for respondent judge's prayer that said cases be returned to his court ""for the lawful actions which are needed on them"" and to set at naught the judgments of conviction already rendered by the Circuit Criminal Court in some of the cases and the other proceedings therein. 


For administrative and record purposes, however, petitioner fiscal should have promptly and in due course advised the clerk of respondent judge's court that the informations had been filed with the Circuit Criminal Court. Petitioner fiscal recognized this oversight and duly ""apologized humbly"" to respondent judge and pleaded an ""acute lack of personnel in his office"" in extenuation. Under the circumstances and considering that petitioner was only discharging his duty according to his best lights, and could not be said to have in any way acted arbitrarily or in bad faith in filing the informations with the Circuit Criminal Court, his apology could have been graciously accepted by respondent judge with an admonition to exercise greater care in the future, in lieu of the unwarranted imposition of punitive fines in the total sum of P 1,000.00.


ACCORDINGLY, the questioned contempt orders and fines imposed therein are annulled and set aside. Without costs.
