Acting on the motion for reconsideration and/or clarification filed by private respondent of the decision in this case, the Court resolved to grant the same, with the result that the statement in said decision to the effect that ""defendant (petitioner herein) had a building with a dancing hall and bowling alleys"" on the lot in question should not be understood as resolving the issue of ownership of said building and bowling alleys or any other improvement thereon, said issue being precisely one of those to be determined by the trial court in Civil Case No. 929. 


So ordered.
