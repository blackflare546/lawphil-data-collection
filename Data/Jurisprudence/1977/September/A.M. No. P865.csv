THIS IS TO CERTIFY that I have this day received from Mr B. ESTIOKO SR. of Urdaneta, Pangasinan, the sum of TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR (P234.00) PESOS only as Sheriff's fee, posting fee, registration of Notice of Level fee and some miscellaneous fee in connection with the CIVIL CASE NO.

Deputy Sheriff

that complainant was not informed that the plaintiffs had requested the respondent for ""enough time to comply with the decision rendered"" against them; that complainant could not understand why the respondent kept the money for one year and three months; and that neither was complainant informed by respondent that it should be complaint's lawyer who should file a motion for the issuance of an ""Alias Writ of Execution.""


The respondent was appointed as deputy sheriff on November 27, 1967. He is still in the service up to the present. This is the only administrative case filed against him.


The record discloses that the respondent received the amount of P234.00 from the complainant in the latter's house in the barrio of San Vicente, Urdaneta, Pangasinan; that it was only after two (2) days when said respondent issued his personal typewritten receipt for the amount; that respondent had kept said amount for about one (1) year and three (3) months; and that the respondent returned the same only after Asst. Fiscal Aquino had advised respondent to return the money to the complainant.


Indeed, if the respondent had no intention of using the amount of P234.00, he should have issued an official receipt of the complainant. The respondent should have informed the complainant what to do to enforce the judgment rendered in his favor; and the respondent should not have kept the money for about one year and three months despite his inability to execute the judgment. 


On all fours with the case at bar is 
Ganaden vs. Bolasco
, 
5
 
an administrative case against a deputy sheriff who received certain sums of money for service of complaint and summons and for a writ of execution without issuing official receipt therefor, wherein this Court said: 




Respondent committed illegal exaction penalized by paragraph 2(b) of Article 213 of the Revised Penal Code for failure to issue receipts for money collected by him officially. 


Respondent likewise violated Section 113 of Article III, Chapter V of the National Accounting and Auditing Manual, providing that no agreement of and nature shall be received by a collecting officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in acknowledgment thereof.


The acts and/or omissions of respondent are patent violation of law. They disturb the ethics of public life and vitiate the integrity of the court personnel as well as the court itself. Public service requires utmost integrity and strictest discipline. A public servant must exhibit at all times the highest sense of honesty and integrity. This yardstick has imprinted in the New Constitution under Section I of Article XIII which stressed that Public office is a public trust Public officers and employees shall observe with the highest degree of responsibility integrity, loyalty and efficiency and shall remain to the people.' Proclamation No. 1081 pointed out officials and employees whether of the national or local must conduct themselves in the manner of the new and society. Respondent's conduct is slightly prejudicial to the this .service. It is classified as a grave offense under A, paragraph III of Civil Service Memorandum Circular No. 8, series of 1970.




This Court, however, takes into consideration that respondent herein has continuously been in the service for almost a decade now, having been appointed as Deputy Sheriff on November 27, 1967 and that this is the first administrative case filed against him. Hence only suspension from office should be imposed instead of dismissal from the service.


WHEREFORE, the respondent is hereby found guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and is ordered suspended without pay for a period of six (6) months from office effective upon notice, with a warning that the commission of another offense will be dealt with severely. 


SO ORDERED.
