SECOND DIVISION 


A.M. No. P-1487	December 20, 1977


MARIA H. PEROL, 
complainant,

vs.


ARSENIO LUPISAN, JR., 
respondents.
 


R E S O L U T I O N 


Â 


AQUINO, 
J.:


Maria H. Perol, a cashier in the D & G restaurant at North Bay Boulevard, Navotas, Rizal, in her verified complaint dated December 27, 1976, charged Arsenio R. Lupisan, Jr., the interpreter in the municipal court of Navotas, Rizal, with immorality for having allegedly caused her pregnancy. 


Lupisan denied the charge. He explained that his relations with Maria were platonic and that she had made him the scapegoat for her predicament after she teamed that he is the sole heir of his widowed mother. 


At the hearing on October 25, 1977, conducted by the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of Caloocan City, Lupisan moved for the dismissal of the charge on the ground that he had ceased to be a court interpreter because his appointment expired on August 11, 1977 and that he was not seeking reappointment. 


In view of that motion to dismiss, the counsel for Maria H. Perol manifested that she was withdrawing her complaint. 


The Investigator in his report recommended that the case be considered closed. 


Under the circumstances, there is no justification for further proceeding against respondent Lupisan. 


WHEREFORE, the complaint is dismissed and this case is considered closed. 


SO ORDERED. 


Barredo, Antonio, Concepcion, Jr. and Guerrero, JJ., concur. 


Fernando and Santos, JJ., are on leave. 


Guerrero, J., was designated to sit in the Second Division.
