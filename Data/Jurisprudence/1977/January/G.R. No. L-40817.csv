respondents.
 


R E S O L U T I O N 


 


MUNOZ PALMA, 
J.:


The San Miguel Corporation filed the, instant Petition for review of a Decision of the Hon. Secretary of Labor dated February 18, 1974, the dispositive portion of which reads: 






WHEREFORE, for lack of merit, the Motion for Reconsideration interposed by respondent, which is hereby treated as an appeal, should be, as it is hereby, Denied. Respondent is hereby ordered to reinstate complainant immediately, with back wages beginning July 26, 1973 until his actual and effective reinstatement. The Commission's Order and the Arbitrator's Award are accordingly modified. (pp. 93-94, rollo) 






The thrust of the appeal is that inasmuch as respondent Secretary of Labor held that private respondent Espino committed a violation of company rules and ordered him suspended for a period of one (1) year, respondent Secretary committed a grave abuse of discretion when he required petitioner to reinstate respondent Espino to the same position of trust and confidence he was holding and pay him commissions which he had not earned. 


Finding the appeal 
prima facie
 meritorious, We required respondents to comment on the Petition after which parties were given time to file their memoranda and the case was considered submitted for decision. (pp. 146, 169, rollo) 


On January 4, 1977, the Court received petitioner's ""Motion to Withdraw Appeal"" which alleged that an amicable settlement was arrived at by the parties. Copy of the agreement is attached to the motion and it reads in part as follows: 






WHEREAS, pending the resolution of the aforesaid Petition for Review on Certiorari, individual respondent Jerome Espino wrote the company a letter seeking retirement and/or termination from his employment effective December 15, 1976 if granted the amount of P6,065.35 covering backwages from July 25, 1973 to the date of his reinstatement of June 10, 1974, as well as termination pay, vacation and sick leave commutation benefits; 


WHEREAS, the proposal of Mr. Jerome Espino is acceptable to the San Miguel Corporation; 


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, covenants and undertakings, terms and conditions herein contained, it is hereby mutually agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows: 


1.	Jerome Espino agrees as per his voluntary proposal to be terminated and/or retired from employment effective December 15, 1976.

4.	Jerome Espino waives any and all claims which he ever had, now has, or shall or may have upon or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever in connection with his employment with the San Miguel Corporation up to the time of these presents. 


5.	The San Miguel Corporation agrees to withdraw its appeal in Case No. G.R. L-40817 upon final execution of instrument and the necessary release papers. 


6.	Jerome Espino further waives any and all rights he may have pursuant to the decision in the case entitled 'Jerome Espino, et a]. vs. SMC', NLRC Case No. LR-182.
