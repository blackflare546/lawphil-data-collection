CONCEPCION JR., 
J
.:


While the South Super Highway was being constructed, the late Julio T. de la Cruz individually contacted owners of land in the vicinity. He was able to gather a group owning a total of 129 hectares, hereinafter referred to as Parañ;aque estate, which, out of his efforts, he was able to sell to the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation or PHHC for short. 


On November 2, 1959, Earthwealth (Phil.),Inc., thru its General Manager, Antonio Martinez, asked aforenamed Julio T. de la Cruz to make legal representations and to negotiate in behalf of the former for the acquisition of the Paranaque estate from the PHHC for P3.50 a square meter, with the understanding that if he should succeed in the negotiation for the purchase of said estate at a price much lower than P3.50, he would be entitled to the difference between the actual purchase price and the said amount as compensation for his legal services.

However, the said parties, in an ""Amended Memorandum Agreement'' 
2
 dated June 15, 1960, modified their agreement of November 2, 1959, thus —  






WHEREAS, the parties hereto signed an agreement between them on November 2, 1959; 


WHEREAS, in view of developments in the case, the parties have deemed it necessary to amend their original agreement of November 2, 1959; 


WHEREAS, the CLIENT has agreed to buy only 100 hectares of the PHHC Paranaque Estate and pay a price as high as P3.80 per square meter, under such terms and conditions as may be imposed by the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation and the Cabinet and/or the President of the Philippines, and that in addition thereto, the further sum of P320,000.00 as attorney's fees for the ATTORNEY herein and 2 hectares of the said Paranaque Estate to be acquired by the CLIENT herein, title to which shall be conveyed free of any liens and encumbrances upon the subdivision and development thereof,

As Better Living, Inc. and Earthwealth, Ltd., had allegedly failed to comply with their obligation to Julio T. de la Cruz, he filed a complaint against them for specific performance. Subsequently, he amended his complaint by including Tropical Homes, Inc. as party defendant. 


After the defendants had filed their respective answers, and after the parties had submitted stipulations of facts, additional evidence was adduced by them. However, during the pendency of this case in the court below, the original plaintiff, Julio T. de la Cruz, died. Consequently, a motion for substitution was filed by his widow and children which was granted. 


On January 18, 1977, decision was rendered ""in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants jointly and severally, for P401,000.00, with interest at the legal rate from the filing of the complaint, and another P10,000.00 for attorney's fees, and the costs of the suit.

Defendants Better Living, Inc. and Tropical Homes, Inc. now come before us by way of the instant appeal. 


Lately, however, the present plaintiffs-appellees and appellant Tropical Homes, Inc. entered into a ""Compromise Agreement"", which is in the following tenor -  






COMPROMISE AGREEMENT 


Plaintiffs-appellees and defendant-appellant Tropical Homes, Inc., assisted by their respective counsel, desiring to settle amicably and terminate their controversies in this case, have agreed, as they do hereby agree, by way of a compromise, as follows: 


1.	That for and in consideration of the sum of One Hundred Fifty Thousand (P150,000.00) Pesos, Philippine Currency, paid by defendant-appellant Tropical Homes, Inc. unto plaintiffs-appellees in the form of the following checks, namely: 


Traders Royal Bank Check No. 33651

			dated June 23, 1975...............P70,000.00

			dated February 23, 1976.......... 
10,000.00 


			 T o t a l ......... P150,000.00 


all of which checks plaintiffs-appellees acknowledged having received, plaintiffs-appellees do hereby relinquish 'and waive, as they have relinquished and waived, in favor of defendant-appellant Tropical Homes, Inc., all of their rights, interests, and participation in and to their cause or causes of action embodied in their amended complaint dated August 16, 1963 in this me, as well as in and to the judgment on the merits based thereon of the Court 
a quo
, subject of the present appeal; 


2.	That defendant-appellant in consequence also relinquishes and waives whatever rights of action it has or may have, if any, against plaintiffs-appellees and/or the original plaintiff, on the matters involved in this case;


3.	That this compromise agreement will be submitted to the Hon. Supreme Court for approval and reduction into judgment, without special pronouncement as to costs. 
6






They, therefore, pray that the compromise agreement be approved and that judgment be rendered accordingly.


Finding the compromise agreement in order, and not against the law, morals and public policy, We hereby approve the same.


Thus, only the appeal of appellant Better Living, Inc. remains to be resolved. In its attempt to avoid any liability to the appellees, the remaining appellant maintains that the lower court erred- 






I


IN FINDING THAT DEFENDANT-APPELLANT BETTER LIVING INC., HAD ASSUMED THE OBLIGATION TO PAY PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE'S CLAIM AND IN HOLDING IT JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE WITH THE OTHER DEFENDANT-APPELLANTS: 


II


IN SENTENCING DEFENDANT-APPELLANT BETTER LIVING, INC. TO PAY P401,000.00, WITH INTEREST AT THE LEGAL RATE FROM THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT, SUCH AMOUNT BEING UNREASONABLE AND UNCONSCIONABLE COMPENSATION FOR LEGAL SERVICES, AND TO PAY ANOTHER P10,000.00 FOR ATTORNEY'S FEES, AND THE COSTS OF SUIT; AND 


III


IN FAILING TO DECLARE VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE PLAINTIFF'S AGREEMENTS WITH DEFENDANT-APPELLANT EARTHWEALTH (PHIL.) LTD. AS CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AND TO LAW AND TO DECLARE THAT ANYWAY PLAINTIFF HAD NOT FULFILLED OR PERFORMED HIS AGENCY IF HE WAS AGENT. 






Appellant Better Living, Inc. pretends that it did not assume the obligation of Earthwealth (Phil.), Ltd. to the appellee. This is quite far from the truth. For, under the ""Absolute Conveyance of Right To Buy Real Estate With All The Obligation Thereto Appertaining And/Or Arising Therefrom"", executed on March 12, 1961 
7
 ""among the obligations Earthwealth is transferring with this conveyance and to be assumed in full and without recourse by the Better Living, Inc. are: ... (4) Sundries which Earthwealth, one way or another, are liable under the circumstances: ..."" It further says —  






VI.	NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the amount of P25,000.00 in hand paid by the Better Living, Inc. unto Earthwealth, receipt of the whole amount is hereby acknowledged and confessed, and other valuable consideration herein, Earthwealth, by these presents, sells, conveys and transfers in a way absolute and irrevocable all its aforestated rights and interest to buy the PHHC 129 hectares of land listed in Annex A with all the obligations thereto appertaining, unto the Better Living, Inc., its successors, assigns, executors and administrators free from all claims of any person whomsoever, other than those above enumerated. 






Added to the foregoing is the fact that appellant Better Living, Inc. had already paid to the appellee a total of P24,000.00 on account of the latter's fees. 
8
 These circumstances taken together crystalize the assumption by said appellant of the obligation of Earthwealth (Phil.).
lwphl@itç 
 Ltd. to the appellee. Anent the second and third assignments of error of appellant Better Living, Inc. suffice it to say that it is now too late it this instance for said appellant to assail appellee's compensation as ""unreasonable and unconscionable"", simply because it did not raise such issue in its answer to appellee's complaint or in its amended answer to the amended complaint.
9
 


In connection with appellee's services, he elucidated thereon the witness stand, thus— 






xxx 			xxx			xxx


Q	 How come, Mr. de la Cruz, that your fees for r.11 your services total P296,000.00 plus two hectares, according to this Exhibit H? 


A.	Well, it was denominated attorney's fees because I happened to be a lawyer, but actually, the services I performed in this was in the nature of promoting the business of the defendants and it was based on a contingent basis. I was to be paid only if I succeeded, and the amount involved in the transaction runs to 100 hectares x P4.20 P4,200,000.00 and the defendants, through my efforts, are now profiting from that; as a matter of fact, selling the property at P38.00 per square meter. 
10


	xxx 			xxx			xxx


Q.	 Mr. de la Cruz, I invite your attention to Exhibit H appearing on page 171 of the records, particularly to the last paragraph thereof, which reads: ""Finally, it is understood that the Client herein shall undertake to pay the Attorney the sums above-stated upon the approval of the purchase of the PHHC Paranaque Estate through his legal representations by the Cabinet and/or the President of the Philippines."" Is it not a fact, Atty. de la Cruz that your agreement, particularly with respect to that portion quoted, refers only to your rendering legal services for the purpose stated therein, that is, to secure the approval of the purchase of the PHHC, Paranaque Estate by the Cabinet and the President of the Philippines? 


A.	May I have the exhibit please? (Witness handed the document, Exhibit H). Well, actually, as I have explained in my direct examination, the contract that we signed, which is this document you are referring to, was in consideration of the services I had rendered for Earthwealth referred to therein as CLIENT, and that the services therein contemplated not only legal but also promotional. Now, in connection with may appearance before the Cabinet which required legal services, I had to appear before the Cabinet in my capacity as a lawyer, especially so because before the case was brought up to the Cabinet, I remember having made the testimony that I had a hard time convincing the Department of Justice, the Secretary of Justice, as to the feasibility and reasonableness of the action taken by the PHHC in connection with my client's views, because the Secretary of Justice rendered an opinion, very much adverse to the Earthwealth, and this opinion is the one appearing on pages 186 to 188, which is Exhibit M for the plaintiff. And because of this opinion I had to file a memorandum with the Cabinet, dated December 1, 1960, copy of which appears on pages 189 to 192 of the expediente which is marked as Exhibit N for the plaintiff, to contradict the opinion of the Secretary of Justice. Subsequent to that time, when the Cabinet met, resulting in the approval of the sale as shown by the letter dated December 14, 1960, 1 was called upon to argue orally before the Cabinet the transaction of my client Earthwealth with the PHHC to justify the purchase of the property so much so that this reference you made to the contract, to the portion of the contract you made, refers to legal representation insofar as appearing before the Cabinet is concerned. 
11
 






It is thus quite clear from the foregoing that the appellee's services were those of a real estate broker and a lawyer. 


Better Living, Inc. has adopted the claim of Tropical Homes, Inc, that the Memorandum Agreement, wherein Earthwealth had agreed to pay the late plaintiff, Julio de la Cruz the amount of P320,000.00 for the latter's services, is in violation of Republic Act No. 3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and therefore, inexistent and void from the beginning. In support thereof, the appellant points to certain admissions made by the late plaintiff during the trial that the sale to Earthwealth was mainly due to his representation and close personal relations with the then General Manager of the PHHC which actions amounted to ""influence peddling"" within the concept of the Anti Graft Law.
12
 


The Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (Rep. Act No. 3019) was enacted on August 17, 1960 and Section 4 of the said act provides, among others, that it shall be unlawful for any person family or close personal relation with any public official to capitalize or exploit or take advantage of such family or close personal relation by directly or indirectly requesting or receiving any present, gift or material or pecuniary advantage from any other person having some business, transaction, application, request or contract with the government, in which such public official has to intervene. Family relation shall include the spouse or relatives by consanguinity or affinity in the third civil degree. The word ""close personal relation"" shall include close personal friendship, social fraternal connections, and professional employment all giving rise to intimacy which assures free access to such public officer. 


Here, it is contended that there is a violation of the Anti-Graft Law since the late plaintiff admitted that there existed a close intimacy between him and Bernardo Torres, the then General Manager of the PHHC; that the late plaintiff did capitalize upon, exploit and take advantage of such close personal relation; that plaintiff capitalized and took advantage of such relation by directly receiving pecuniary advantage from the Earthwealth through their agreement, 
13
 and that the public official he influenced, Mr. Bernardo Torres had to intervene in the transaction which Earthwealth had with the PHHC of which Mr. Torres was the Chairman of the Board and General Manager. 


Indeed, it is very clear on the records that the late plaintiff-appellee had capitalized on his friendship and intimacy with the General Manager of the PHHC in promoting the sale of the Parañ;aque Estate to his client, Earthwealth. The exploitation of friendship, however, ceased on July 21, 1960, when the PHHC Board of Directors approved the said sale through its Resolution No. 38.
14
 
Considering that the Anti-Graft Law was enacted subsequent thereto, on August 17, 1960, the provisions of said law cannot be given retroactive effect and invoked against the late plaintiff- appellee. Although the sale was finally approved by the President and/or his Cabinet on December 14, 1960, 
15
 there is no evidence to show that the late Julio de la Cruz is a close intimate of the President and capitalized on such close personal relations in the final approval of the sale. 


WHEREFORE, and in view of the aforequoted compromise agreement executed by the -appellees on one hand and appellant Tropical Homes, Inc., and the ""Joint Motion For Judgment and Termination of Case"" submitted by appellants Tropical Homes, Inc. and Better Living Inc., the judgment appealed from is hereby modified, thus: 


1.	Appellant Tropical Homes, Inc. is hereby relieved from further liability to the appellees; 


2.	Appellant Better Living, Inc. is sentenced to pay the appellees the sum of P251,000.00 with legal interest thereon from the filing of the complaint, and attorney's fees in the amount of P10,000.00. The appealed judgment is affirmed in all other respects, with costs against appellant Better Living, Inc. 


SO ORDERED. 


Martin, Santos and Guerrero, JJ., concur. 


Antonio and Aquino, JJ., concur in the result.


Fernando and Barredo, JJ., took no part.


Martin and Guerrero, JJ., were designated to sit in the Second Division.

12	The testimony reads in part, as follows: 


	Q.	Now going over the exhibits, I noted Mr. de la Cruz, a memorandum by the then Manager of the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation, Mr. Bernardo Torres addressed to the President of the Philippines, justifying the Earthwealth contract, which is Exhibit J of the records, appearing on Pages 173 to 177. Have you had occasion to read this exhibit before you have prepared your memorandum to the Cabinet, Exhibit 'N'? 


	A	Yes, as a matter of fact, I was the one who prepared this before Mr. Torres' presence. We worked together to justify the sale of the property, and I can remember that this was even typed in my own typewriter. 


	Q	And it was signed by Mr. Torres after you prepared it? 


	A 	We worked together to justify the sale. 


	Q	 Knowing, as you alleged, that the decision, as you testify now, to dispose of the Paranaque Estate in favor of third parties, particularly Earthwealth, was your suggestion, did you not protest to Mr. Torres that no mention was ever made of the fact that you made such suggestion in Exhibit 'H'? 


	A	There was no need for that. All that I was interested was that the sale would go through. I did not want to claim credit for it, and it would have been ridiculous for Mr. Torres to make mention there that this memorandum was made by Mr. de la Cruz. Q Will you be kind enough to inform the Hon. Court why Mr. Torres had such confidence in you to allow you to prepare a memorandum for him addressed to the President of the Philippines? A In the first place, I was the one who grouped together these properties, as I said during my direct examination, and I know the history and background of these properties. Furthermore, Mr. Torres and I are from the same province and he knows me intimately, and he has trust in me, that is why he asked me to collaborate with his office to prepare the memorandum to justify the sale, especially in the light of the opinion already rendered by the Department of Justice.""
