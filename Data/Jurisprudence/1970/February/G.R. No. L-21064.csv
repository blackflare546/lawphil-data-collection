FERNANDO, 
J.:


In this special civil action for prohibition to nullify a legislative act directing the expropriation of the Tatalon Estate, Quezon City,
1
 this Court is called upon to inquire further into how far the power of Congress under the constitution to authorize upon payment of just compensation the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to individuals
2
 may extend, the more so as this is the first time the judiciary is confronted with such a challenge addressed to the validity of a statute specifically made applicable to a particular piece of land, owned by petitioner J. M. Tuason & Co. In the leading case of 
Guido v. Rural Progress
,
3
 decided in 1949. this Court in passing upon the scope of the power of the President conferred by statute ""to acquire private lands or any interest therein, through purchase or expropriation, and to subdivide the same into home lots or small farms for resale at reasonable prices and under such conditions as he may fix to their 
bona fide
 tenants or occupants""
4
 had occasion to delineate the contours of the above constitutional provision, reconciling the undoubtedly broad grant of constitutional authority to Congress with the right of property that might be adversely affected by its exercise.


The prevailing opinion in the later case 
Republic v. Baylosis
5
 tilted the balance in favor of property. In deciding this suit, filed with the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, the lower court, as was understandable, bowed to what it considered the compulsion such an opinion carries and being unable to perceive any relevant ground for distinction, declared the challenged statute invalid. The respondents, the Land Tenure Administration, the Solicitor General and the Auditor General in this prohibition proceeding, appealed. We are possessed undoubtedly of greater discretion on the matter. Nor is it to be lost sight of, as abovementioned, that this is the first controversy where the expropriation of a particular property authorized by Congress under the above constitutional provision is assailed as beyond its power. The opportunity is thus here present of making more definite the boundaries of such congressional competence.


As will hereafter be explained with some measure of fullness, we cannot affix the stamp of approval to the judgment of the lower court; we reach a different conclusion. There is to our mind no sufficient showing of the unconstitutionality of the challenged act. We reverse.


On August 3, 1959, Republic Act No. 2616 took effect without executive approval. It is therein provided: ""The expropriation of the Tatalon Estate in Quezon City jointly owned by the J. M. Tuason and Company, Inc., Gregorio Araneta and Company, Inc., and Florencio Deudor, et al., is hereby authorized.""
6
 As noted in the appealed decision:






The lands involved in this action, to which Republic Act No. 2616 refer and which constitute a certain portion of the Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision, have a total area of about 109 hectares and are covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 42774 and 49235 of the Registry of Deeds of Rizal (Quezon City) registered in the name of petitioner.
7






Thereafter, on November 15, 1960, respondent Land Tenure Administration was directed by the then Executive Secretary to institute the proceeding for the expropriation of the Tatalon Estate. Not losing any time, petitioner J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed before the lower court on November 17, 1960 a special action for prohibition with preliminary injunction against respondents praying that the above act be declared unconstitutional, seeking in the meanwhile a preliminary injunction to restrain respondents from instituting such expropriation proceeding, thereafter to be made permanent after trial. The next day, on November 18, 1960, the lower court granted the prayer for the preliminary injunction upon the filing of a P20,000.00 bond. After trial, the lower court promulgated its decision on January 10, 1963 holding that Republic Act No. 2616 as amended is unconstitutional and granting the writ of prohibition prayed for.


Hence this appeal by respondents, one we find meritorious. With the problem thus laid bare and with an exposition of the constitutional principles that compel a result different from that arrived at by the lower court, we cannot accept its holding that the statute thus assailed should be annulled.


1.	Respondents would interpose two procedural bars sufficient in their opinion to preclude the lower court from passing on the question of validity.
8
 The first is the allegation that in effect this special proceeding for prohibition is ""actually a suit against the State, which is not allowed without its consent.""
9
 The second would require, on the assumption that the suit could proceed, that the Executive Secretary, as the real party in interest, ought to have been impleaded. Neither objection suffices to preclude the lower court from passing upon the question of validity of the statute in question.


As was held by this Court in the leading case of 
Angara v. Electoral 

Commission
, 
10
 speaking through Justice Laurel, the power of judicial review is granted, if not expressly, at least by clear implication from the relevant provisions of the 

Constitution. 
11
 This power may be exercised when the party adversely affected by either a legislative or executive act, or a municipal ordinance for that matter, files the appropriate suit to test its validity. The special civil action of prohibition has been relied upon precisely to restrain the enforcement of what is alleged to be an unconstitutional statute. 
12
 As it is a fundamental postulate that the Constitution as the supreme law is binding on all governmental agencies, failure to observe the limitations found therein furnishes a sufficient ground for a declaration of the nullity of the governmental measure challenged. The argument then that the government is the adverse party and that therefore must consent to its being sued certainly is far from persuasive. Moreover, it is equally well-settled that for the purpose of thus obtaining a judicial declaration of nullity, it is enough if the respondents or defendants named be the government officials who would give operation and effect to official action allegedly tainted with unconstitutionality. As it cannot be denied that in 1959 the then Land Tenure Administration as well as the Solicitor General were called upon to enforce the statute now assailed, it would appear clear that the existence on the Executive Secretary being made a party lacks support in law.


It would be then to set aside and disregard doctrines of unimpeachable authority if the plea of respondents on these procedural points raised were to meet an affirmative response. That we are not disposed to do.


2.	Thus we reach the merits. It would appear, as noted at the outset, that for the purpose of deciding the question of validity squarely raised, a further inquiry into the scope of the constitutional power of Congress to authorize the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to individuals 
13
 is indicated, if for no other purpose than to attain a greater degree of clarity. The question is one then of constitutional construction. It is well to recall fundamentals. The primary task is one of ascertaining and thereafter assuring the realization of the purpose of the framers and of the people in the adoption of the Constitution. 
14


We look to the language of the document itself in our search for its meaning. We do not of course stop there, but that is where we begin. It is to be assumed that the words in which constitutional provisions are couched express the objective sought to be attained. They are to be given their ordinary meaning except where technical terms are employed in which case the significance thus attached to them prevails. As the Constitution is not primarily a lawyer's document, it being essential for the rule of law to obtain that it should ever be present in the people's consciousness, its language as much as possible should be understood in the sense they have in common use. What it says according to the text of the provision to be construed compels acceptance and negates the power of the courts to alter it, based on the postulate that the framers and the people mean what they say. Thus there are cases where the need for construction is reduced to a minimum.


This is one of them. It does not admit of doubt that the congressional power thus conferred is far from limited. It is left to the legislative will to determine what lands may be expropriated so that they could be subdivided for resale to those in need of them. Nor can it be doubted either that as to when such authority may be exercised is purely for Congress to decide. Its discretion on the matter is not to be interfered with. The language employed is not swathed in obscurity. The recognition of the broad congressional competence is undeniable. The judiciary in the discharge of its task to enforce constitutional commands and prohibitions is denied the prerogative of curtailing its well-nigh all-embracing sweep.


Reference to the 
historical
 basis of this provision as reflected in the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, two of the extrinsic aids to construction along with the contemporaneous understanding and the consideration of the consequences that flow from the interpretation under consideration, yields additional light on the matter. The opinion of Justice Tuason, in the Guido case did precisely that. It cited the speech of delegate Miguel Cuaderno, who, in speaking of large estates and trusts in perpetuity, stated: ""There has been an impairment of public tranquility, and to be sure a continuous impairment of it, because of the existence of these conflicts. In our folklore the oppression and exploitation of the tenants are vividly referred to; their sufferings at the hand of the landlords are emotionally pictured in our drama; and even in the native movies and talkies of today, this theme of economic slavery has been touched upon. In official documents these same conflicts are narrated and exhaustively explained as a threat to social order and 

stability."" 
15
 He invoked likewise what happened to the family of our national hero Jose Rizal: ""But we should go to Rizal for inspiration and illumination in this problem of the conflicts between landlords and tenants. The national hero and his family were persecuted because of these same conflicts in Calamba, and Rizal himself met a martyr's death because of his exposal of the cause of the tenant class, because he would not close his eyes to oppression and persecution with his own people as victims."" 
16
 Delegate Cuaderno closed with this appeal: ""If we are to be true to our trust, if it is our purpose in drafting our constitution to insure domestic tranquility and to provide for the well-being of our people, we cannot, we must not fail to prohibit the ownership of large estates, to make it the duty of the government to break up existing large estates, and to provide for their acquisition by purchase or through expropriation and sale to their occupants, as has been provided in the Constitutions of Mexico and Jugoslavia."" 
17


The above address was delivered during the early days of the convention on August 21, 1934. 
18
 Subsequently, the day before the above constitutional provision was voted on January 29, 1935 he reiterated what was said by him in the above address. Thus: ""Mr. President, this will be my last speech in the Convention. And I just want to remind the Convention of the first speech that I delivered — the first speech I delivered before this Assembly. I believe, Mr. President, that one of the best provisions that this draft of the Constitution contains is this provision that will prevent the repetition of the history of misery, of trials and tribulations of the poor tenants throughout the length and breadth of the Philippine Islands."" 
19


This is not to say that such an appeal to history as disclosed by what could be accepted as the pronouncement that did influence the delegates to vote for such a grant of power could be utilized to restrict the scope thereof, considering the language employed. For what could be expropriated are ""lands,"" not ""landed estates."" It is well to recall what Justice Laurel would impress on us, ""historical discussion while valuable is not necessarily decisive."" 
20
 It is easy to understand why.


The social and economic conditions are not static. They change with the times. To identify the text of a written constitution with the circumstances that inspired its inclusion may render it incapable of being responsive to future needs. Precisely, it is assumed to be one of the virtues of a written constitution that it suffices to govern the life of the people not only at the time of its framing but far into the indefinite future. It is not to be considered as so lacking in flexibility and suppleness that it may be a bar to measures, novel and unorthodox, as they may appear to some, but nonetheless imperatively called for. Otherwise it might expose itself to the risk of inability to survive in the face of complexities that time may bring in its wake.


It would thus be devoid of the character of permanency, which is the distinguishing mark of a constitution. Such was the conclusion deliberately arrived at after extensive discussion in the Constitutional Convention that the Constitution as adopted in 1935 would be good not only for the Commonwealth but for the Republic, with all the vicissitudes that time and circumstance would bring. Our people in signifying their adherence to the Constitution at the plebiscite thereafter held were of a similar persuasion.


The continuing life of a constitution was stressed by one of the chief architects of the Constitution, Manuel A. Roxas, later to be the first President of the Republic. For him it is ""the essence of such an instrument."" 
21
 It was his view that the constitution to be adopted by the Constitutional Convention of 1934 would ""have an indefinite life, will be permanent, subject of course, to revisions, amendments and other changes that may be adopted constitutionally."" 
22
 That would be an assurance that constitutional guarantees ""will be maintained, property rights will be safeguarded and individual rights maintained immaculate and sanctified. ..."" 
23
 Another prominent delegate, Gregorio Perfecto, later a member of this Tribunal, aptly noted that the transitory character is essentially incompatible with the nature of laws, and necessarily so of a constitution, which is the supreme law of a people and therefore must be impressed with such attribute of permanency, much more than ordinary statutes passed under its authority. 
24


It could thus be said of our Constitution as of the United States Constitution, to borrow from Chief Justice Marshall's pronouncement in 
M'Culloch v. Maryland
 
25
 that it is ""intended to endure for ages to come and consequently, to be adapted to the various crisis of human affairs."" It cannot be looked upon as other than, in the language of another American jurist, Chief Justice Stone, ""a continuing instrument of government."" 
26
 Its framers were not visionaries, toying with speculations or theories, but men of affairs, at home in statecraft, laying down the foundations of a government which can make effective and operative all the powers conferred or assumed, with the corresponding restrictions to secure individual rights and, anticipating, subject to the limitations of human foresight, the problems that events to come in the distant days ahead will bring. Thus a constitution, to quote from Justice Cardozo, ""state or ought to state not rules for the passing hour, but principles for an expanding future."" 
27


To that primordial intent, all else is subordinated. Our Constitution, any constitution, is not to be construed narrowly or pedantically, for the prescriptions therein contained, to paraphrase Justice Holmes, are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form, but are organic living institutions, the significance of which is vital nor formal. There must be an awareness, as with Justice Brandeis, not only of what has been, but of what may be. The words employed by it are not to be construed to yield fixed and rigid answers but as impressed with the necessary attributes of flexibility and accommodation to enable them to meet adequately whatever problems the future has in store. It is not, in brief, a printed finality but a dynamic process.


3.	The conclusion is difficult to resist that the text of the constitutional provision in question, its historical background as noted in pronouncements in the Constitutional Convention and the inexonerable need for the Constitution to have the capacity for growth and ever be adaptable to changing social and economic conditions all argue against its restrictive construction. Such an approach was reflected succinctly in the dissenting opinion of Justice J.B.L. Reyes, concurred in by the present Chief Justice, in the Baylosis case. We find it persuasive.


His dissenting opinion opens thus: ""I am constrained to dissent from the opinion of the majority. The reasons set forth by it against the validity of the proposed expropriation strike me as arguments against the expropriation policies adopted by the government rather than reasons against the existence and application of the condemnation power in the present case."" 
28
 Then he stated: ""The propriety of exercising the power of eminent domain under Article XIII, section 4 of our Constitution can not be determined on a purely quantitative or area basis. Not only does the constitutional provision speak of lands instead of
 landed estates
, but I see no cogent reason why the government, in its quest for social justice and peace, should exclusively devote attention to conflicts of large proportions, involving a considerable number of individuals, and eschew small controversies and wait until they grow into a major problem before taking remedial action."" 
29


As to the role of the courts in the appraisal of the congressional implementation of such a power, he had this to say: ""The Constitution considered the small individual land tenure to be so important to the maintenance of peace and order and to the promotion of progress and the general welfare that it not only provided for the expropriation and subdivision of lands but also opened the way for the limitation of private landholdings (Art. XIII, section 3). It is not for this Court to judge the worth of these and other social and economic policies expressed by the Constitution; our duty is to conform to such policies and not to block their realization."" 
30


The above dissent, as well as that penned by the then Chief Justice Paras with whom the then Justice Pablo was in agreement, with Justice Alex Reyes writing a concurring opinion, resulted in that the main opinion of Justice Montemayor, while prevailing, failed to elicit the necessary majority vote of six. If for that reason alone re-examination would not appear to be inappropriate. Moreover, it could not be considered as controlling the present suit, in view of the fact that the exercise of the congressional authority to expropriate land was not direct as in this case but carried out in pursuance of the statutory authority conferred on the President under Commonwealth Act No. 539.


The absence of any controlling force of such prevailing opinion can likewise be predicated on facts which would differentiate the present situation from that found in the Baylosis case. Thus Justice Montemayor noted: ""The evidence shows that both Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis at one time were willing to sell to some of the tenants and occupants herein involved under certain conditions and provided that they buy in groups, presumably to avoid subdivisions and the problem of dealing with many individual buyers, but the tenants failed to buy. Naturally, they may not now compel Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis to sell to them through the Government by means of expropriation. Besides, the bulk of the lands that Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis had formerly offered to them for sale which offer they failed to take advantage of, has now been sold to others, the other co-defendants herein, in small lots."" 
31
 Likewise, it was noted by him: ""There is another point that merits consideration. The defendants claim and correctly that many of the tenants and occupants now insisting on expropriation have lands of their own."" 
32


The more fundamental reason though why we find ourselves unable to yield deference to such opinion of Justice Montemayor, well-written and tightly-reasoned as it is, is its undue stress on property rights. It thus appears then that it failed to take into account the greater awareness exhibited by the framers of our Constitution of the social forces at work when they drafted the fundamental law. To be more specific, they were seriously concerned with the grave problems of inequality of wealth, with its highly divisive tendency, resulting in the generous scope accorded the police power and eminent domain prerogatives of the state, even if the exercise thereof would cover terrain previously thought of as beyond state control, to promote social justice and the general welfare.


This is not to say of course that property rights are disregarded. This is merely to emphasize that the philosophy of our Constitution embodying as it does what Justice Laurel referred to as its ""nationalistic and socialist traits discoverable upon even a sudden dip into a variety of [its] provisions"" although not extending as far as the ""destruction or annihilation"" of the rights to property, 
33
 negates the postulate which at one time reigned supreme in American constitutional law as to their well-nigh inviolable character. This is not so under our Constitution, which rejects the doctrine of 
laissez faire
 with its abhorrence for the least interference with the autonomy supposed to be enjoyed by the property owner. 
Laissez faire
, as Justice Malcolm pointed out as far back as 1919, did not take too firm a foothold in our jurisprudence. 
34
 Our Constitution is much more explicit. There is no room for it for Laissez faire. So Justice Laurel affirmed not only in the above opinion but in another concurring opinion quoted with approval in at least two of our subsequent decisions. 
35
 We had occasion to reiterate such a view in the ACCFA case, decided barely two months ago. 
36


This particular grant of authority to Congress authorizing the expropriation of land is a clear manifestation of such a policy that finds expression in our fundamental law. So is the social justice principle enshrined in the Constitution of which it is an expression, as so clearly pointed out in the respective dissenting opinions of Justice J.B.L. Reyes and Chief Justice Paras in the Baylosis case. Why it should be thus is so plausibly set forth in the ACCFA decision, the opinion being penned by Justice Makalintal. We quote: ""The growing complexities of modern society, however, have rendered this traditional classification of the functions of government quite unrealistic, not to say absolute. The areas which used to be left to private enterprise and initiative and which the government was called upon to enter optionally, and only ""because it was better equipped to administer for the public welfare than is any private individual or group of individuals,"" continue to lose their well-defined boundaries and to be absorbed within activities that the government must undertake in its sovereign capacity if it is to meet the increasing social challenges of the times. Here as almost everywhere else the tendency is undoubtedly towards a greater socialization of economic forces. Here of course this development was envisioned, indeed adopted as a national policy, by the Constitution itself in its declaration of principle concerning the promotion of social justice.""


It would thus appear that the prevailing opinion in the Baylosis case is far from compelling. To the extent that the conclusion reached by us in this suit proceeds from a different reading of the constitutional provision in question, it must be deemed as being possessed of less than decisive weight.


4.	There need be no fear that such constitutional grant of power to expropriate lands is without limit. As in the case of the more general provision on eminent domain, there is the explicit requirement of the payment of just compensation. It is well-settled that just compensation means the equivalent for the value of the property at the time of its taking. Anything beyond that is more, and anything short of that is less, than just compensation. It means a fair and full equivalent for the loss sustained, which is the measure of the indemnity, not whatever gain would accrue to the expropriating entity. The market value of the land taken is the just compensation to which the owner of condemned property is entitled, the market value being that sum of money which a person desirous, but not compelled to buy, and an owner, willing, but not compelled to sell, would agree on as a price to be given and received for such property. There must be a consideration then of all the facts which make it commercially valuable. The question is what would be obtained for it on the market from parties who want to buy and would give full value. Testimonies as to real estate transactions in the vicinity are admissible. It must be shown though that the property as to use must be of similar character to the one sought to be condemned. The transaction must likewise be coeval as to time. To the market value must be added the consequential damages, if any, minus the consequential benefits. The assessed value of real property while constituting
 prima facie
 evidence of its value in case of condemnation proceedings is not conclusive. 
37


Then, too, it is a prerequisite for the valid exercise of such a congressional power that the taking be for the
 public use
. To quote from the Guido decision: ""It has been truly said that the assertion of the right on the part of the legislature to take the property of one citizen and transfer it to another, even for a full compensation, when the public interest is not promoted thereby, is claiming a despotic power, and one inconsistent with every just principle and fundamental maxim of a free government."" 
38
 It is on that account that we granted prohibition to restrain respondent Rural Progress Administration from proceeding with the expropriation of petitioner's land, two adjoining lots, part commercial with a combined area of slightly more than two hectares. As was stressed by Justice Tuason in his opinion: ""No fixed line of demarcation between what taking is for public use and what is not can be made; each case has to be judged according to its peculiar circumstances. It suffices to say for the purpose of this decision that the case under consideration is far wanting in those elements which make for public convenience or public use."" 
39
 Such is not the situation before us now. Nor are we disposed to dispute the legislative appraisal of the matter.


5.	The failure to meet the exacting standard of due process would likewise constitute a valid objection to the exercise of this congressional power. That was so intimated in the above leading Guido case. There was an earlier pronouncement to that effect in a decision rendered long before the adoption of the Constitution under the previous organic law then in force, while the Philippines was still an unincorporated territory of the United States. 
40


It is obvious then that a landowner is covered by the mantle of protection due process affords. It is a mandate of reason. It frowns on arbitrariness, it is the anti-thesis of any governmental act that smacks of whim or caprice. It negates state power to act in an oppressive manner. It is, as had been stressed so often, the embody of the sporting idea of fair play. In that sense, it stands as a guaranty of justice. That is the standard that must be met by any governmental agency in the exercise of whatever competence is entrusted to 

it.
41
 
As was so emphatically stressed by the present Chief Justice, ""acts of Congress, as well as those of the Executive, can deny due process only under pain of nullity, . ... ."" 
42


It is easily understandable then why the expropriation of lots less than one hectare in 
City of Manila v. Arellano Law College
, 
43
 
Lee Tay v. Choco
 
44
 and 
Republic vs. 

Samia 
45
 and of lots less than two hectares in 
Commonwealth v. De Borja
 
46
 and 
Republic v. Prieto
 
47
 was not given the sanction of approval by this Court, the failure to meet the due process requirement being quite evident.


6.	It is primarily the equal protection guaranty though that petitioner's case is made to rest. The Constitution requires that no person be denied ""the equal protection of the laws."" 
48
 A juridical being is included within its terms.


The assumption underlying such a guaranty is that a legal norm, whether embodied in a rule, principle, or standard, constitutes a defense against anarchy at one extreme and tyranny at the other. Thereby, people living together in a community with its myriad and complex problems can minimize the friction and reduce the conflicts, to assure, at the very least, a peaceful ordering of existence. The ideal situation is for the law's benefits to be available to all, that none be placed outside the sphere of its coverage. Only thus could chance and favor be excluded and the affairs of men governed by that serene and impartial uniformity, which is of the very essence of the idea of law.


The actual, given things as they are and likely to continue to be, cannot approximate the ideal. Nor is the law susceptible to the reproach that it does not take into account the realities of the situation. The constitutional guaranty then is not to be given a meaning that disregards what is, what does in fact exist. 
49
 To assure that the general welfare be promoted, which is the end of law, a regulatory measure may cut into the rights to liberty and property. Those adversely affected may under such circumstances invoke the equal protection clause only if they can show that the governmental act assailed, far from being inspired by the attainment of the common weal was prompted by the spirit of hostility, or at the very least, discrimination that finds no support in reason. .


It suffices then that the laws operate equally and uniformly on all persons under similar circumstances or that all persons must be treated in the same manner, the conditions not being different, both in the privileges conferred and the liabilities imposed. Favoritism and undue preference cannot be allowed. For the principle is that equal protection and security shall be given to every person under circumstances, which if not identical are analogous. If law be looked upon in terms of burden or charges, those that fall within a class should be treated in the same fashion, whatever restrictions cast on some in the group equally binding on the rest.


It is precisely because the challenged statute applies only to petitioner that he could assert a denial of equal protection. As set forth in its brief: ""Republic Act No. 2616 is directed solely against appellee and for this reason violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution. Unlike other laws which confer authority to expropriate landed estates in general, it singles out the Tatalon Estate. It cannot be said, therefore, that it deals equally with other lands in Quezon City or elsewhere."" 
50
 With due recognition then of the Power of Congress to designate the particular property to be taken and how much thereof may be condemned in the exercise of the power of expropriation, it is still a judicial question whether in the exercise of such competence, the party adversely affected is the victim of partiality and prejudice. That the equal protection clause will not allow.


The judiciary can look into the facts then, no conclusiveness being attached to a determination of such character when reliance is had either to the due process clause which is a barrier against arbitrariness and oppressiveness and the equal protection guaranty which is an obstacle to invidious discrimination.


We start of course with the presumption of validity, the doubts being resolved in favor of the challenged enactment. 
51
 As this is the first statute of its kind assailed, we should not stop our inquiry there. The occasion that called for such legislation, if known, goes far in meeting any serious constitutional objection raised. We turn to the Explanatory Note of the bill, 
52
 which was enacted into the challenged statute. It started with the declaration that it provides for the ""expropriation of the Tatalon Estate, Quezon City, and for the sale at cost of the lots therein to their present bona fide occupants, authorizing therefor the appropriation of ten million pesos."" Then it continued: ""The Tatalon Estate has an area of more than ninety six hectares and the lots therein are at present occupied by no less than one thousand five hundred heads of families, most of whom are veterans of World War II. It is the earnest desire of this group of patriotic and loyal citizens to purchase the lots at a minimum cost."" Why there was such a need for expropriation was next taken up: ""The population of Quezon City has considerably increased. This increase in population is posing a serious housing problem to city residents. This bill will not only solve the problem but will also implement the land-for-the-landless program of the present Administration.""


What other facts are there which would remove the alleged infirmity of the statute on equal protection grounds? The brief for respondents invited our attention to the social problem which this legislation was intended to remedy. Thus: ""There is a vital point which should have great weight in the decision of this case. The petitioner led the occupants of Tatalon Estate to believe that they were dealing with the representatives of the real owners, the Veterans Subdivision, in the purchase of their lots. The occupants believed in good faith that they were dealing with the representatives of the owners of the lots. This belief was bolstered by the fact that the petitioners herein even entered into a compromise agreement on March 16, 1953 with the Deudors, agreeing to give the latter millions of pesos in settlement of their claim over the Tatalon Estate. The occupants, therefore, purchased their respective portions from the Veterans Subdivision in good faith. The petitioner allowed the Veterans Subdivision to construct roads in the Tatalon Estate; it allowed said firm to establish an office in the Tatalon Estate and to advertise the sale of the lots inside the Tatalon Estate. Petitioner admits having full knowledge of the activities of the Veterans Subdivision and yet did not lift a finger to stop said acts. The occupants paid good money for their lots and spent fortunes to build their homes. It was after the place has been improved with the building of the roads and the erection of substantial residential homes that petitioner stepped into the picture, claiming for the first time that it is the owner of the Tatalon Estate. Some of the occupants had erected their houses as early as 1947 and 1948. ..."" 
53


The cutting edge of the above assertions could have been blunted by the brief for petitioner. This is all it did say on the matter though: ""Appellants alleged that appellee 'led the occupants of Tatalon Estate to believe that they were dealing with the representatives of the real owners, the Veterans Subdivision, in the purchase of their lots' ... . There is absolutely no evidence on record to establish this ludicrous allegation."" 
54
 Only the alleged duplicity of petitioner was denied, leaving unanswered the rather persuasive recital of conditions that could rightly motivate Congress to act as it did. Clearly, there is no sufficient refutation of the seriousness of the problem thus underscored by respondents, the solution of which is the aim of the statute now under attack.


This is not to deny that whenever Congress points to a particular piece of property to be expropriated, it is faced with a more serious scrutiny as to its power to act in the premises. It would require though a clear and palpable showing of its having singled out a party to bear the brunt of governmental authority that may be legitimately exerted, induced, it would appear by a feeling of disapproval or ill-will to make out a case of this guaranty having been disregarded. If such were the case, then in the language of Justice Laurel, it ""will be the time to make the [judicial] hammer fall and heavily. But not until then."" 
55
 The most careful study of the matter before us however yields the conclusion that petitioner was unable to sustain the burden of demonstrating a denial of equal protection.


Moreover, there is nothing to prevent Congress in view of the public funds at its disposal to follow a system of priorities. It could thus determine what lands would first be the subject of expropriation. This it did under the challenged legislative act. As already noted, Congress was moved to act in view of what it considered a serious social and economic problem. The solution which for it was the most acceptable was the authorization of the expropriation of the Tatalon Estate. So it provided under the statute in question. It was confronted with a situation that called for correction, and the legislation that was the result of its deliberation sought to apply the necessary palliative. That it stopped short of possibly attaining the cure of other analogous ills certainly does not stigmatize its effort as a denial of equal protection. We have given our sanction to the principle underlying the exercise of police power and taxation, but certainly not excluding eminent domain, that ""the legislature is not required by the Constitution to adhere to the policy of ""all or none"". 
56
 Thus, to reiterate, the invocation by petitioner of equal protection clause is not attended with success.


7.	The other points raised may be briefly disposed of. Much is made of what the lower court considered to be the inaccuracy apparent on the face of the challenged statute as to the ownership of the Tatalon Estate. It could very well be that Congress ought to have taken greater pains to avoid such imprecision. At any rate, the lower court, unduly alarmed, would consider it a deprivation of property without due process of law. 
57
 Such a fear is unwarranted. In the course of the expropriation proceedings, there undoubtedly would be a judicial determination as to the party entitled to the just compensation. As of now then, such a question would appear at the very least to be premature. Reference is likewise made as to the effect of the authorized expropriation on those purchasers of lots located in the Tatalon Estate. Again, on the occasion of the expropriation, whatever contractual rights might he possessed by vendors and vendees could be asserted and accorded the appropriate constitutional protection.


8.	What appears undeniable is that in the light of the broad grant of congressional power so apparent from the text of the constitutional provision, the historical background as made clear during the deliberation for the Constitutional Convention, and the cardinal postulate underlying constitutional construction that its provisions are not to be interpreted to preclude their being responsive to future needs, the fundamental law being intended to govern the life of a nation as it unfolds through the ages, the challenged statute can survive the test of validity. If it were otherwise, then the judiciary may lend itself susceptible to the charge that in its appraisal of governmental measures with social and economic implications, its decisions are characterized by the narrow, unyielding insistence on the primacy of property rights, contrary to what the Constitution ordains. In no other sphere of judicial activity are judges called upon to transcend personal predilections and private notions of policy, lest legislation intended to bring to fruition the hope of a better life for the great masses of our people, as embodied in the social justice principle of which this constitutional provision under scrutiny is a manifestation, be unjustifiably stricken down. The appealed decision cannot stand.


WHEREFORE, the decision of the lower court of January 10, 1963 holding that Republic Act No. 2616 as amended by Republic Act No. 3453 is unconstitutional is reversed. The writ of prohibition suit is denied, and the preliminary injunction issued by the lower court set aside. With costs against petitioner.


Zaldivar, Sanchez and Villamor, JJ., concur.


Makalintal, J., concurs in the result.


 


 


 


Separate Opinions


 


BARREDO, 
J., 
concurring:


I concur, and this separate opinion is intended only to clarify two statements in the scholarly main opinion of Mr. Justice Fernando that appear to me to be quite inconsistent with each other. It is said therein that ""it (the language of the constitutional provision herein involved) does not admit of doubt that the congressional power thus conferred is far from limited"", (p. 422
 * 
) and that it has a ""well-nigh all embracing sweep"". (p. 423
 * 
) but at page 431
 *
 it is also said that ""there need be no fear that such constitutional grant of power to expropriate is without limit"". To avoid any mistake regarding my view as to which of these two statements should prevail, I would like to state categorically that I consider the power granted to Congress by the Constitution to ""authorize, upon payment of just compensation, the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to individuals"" to be unlimited by any other provision of said Constitution. Just compensation is in reality a part of the power granted rather than a limitation thereto, just as just compensation is of the essence in any exercise of the power of eminent domain, as otherwise, it would be plain commandeering. Withal, I hold that the power of eminent domain, in general, is an inherent power of any government, as, otherwise, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the government to adequately respond to the demands of public need and interest. What government can exist without the power to expropriate lands for streets, schools, public buildings, wharves and military reservations, to mention only some of the indispensable things that any country worthy of its name must establish as necessary means to accomplish its purposes?


As a statement of principle, it is right to reiterate as the main opinion does, that ""for the valid exercise of such (the) congressional power, (to expropriate lands for the purpose indicated) that the taking be for public use"", but it is entirely a different matter to imply that in the judicial proceeding instituted towards such end, the Government is still required to present evidence of such public use as a fact. I take it that the constitutional provision itself declares the public objective, purpose or use of the expropriation contemplated, which is the amelioration of long standing socio-agrarian conditions endangering the very ideology on which our government and way of life rest, hence, it should follow that as long as a congressional legislation declares that the condemnation of a particular land is for the specific purpose stated in the Constitution, it is not for the judiciary to inquire as to whether or not the taking of such land is for public use. The Constitution itself which is supposed to be the supreme law on private property rights declares it to be so, and leaves it to Congress, not to the judiciary, to make the choice of the lands to be taken to attain the objective the constituent assembly aimed to achieve. The scope and the limit of the power of the judiciary in this regard is only to determine the existence of enabling legislation, to see to it that the facts are as contemplated in such enabling act and to provide the vehicle for compliance with procedural due process in the implementation of the congressional act.


The concurring and dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Teehankee, particularly because he is joined by our eminent Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion and three of my distinguished senior colleagues, Messrs. Justices Jose B. L. Reyes, Arsenio Dizon and Fred Ruiz Castro, commends itself for the deep concern it holds for individual property rights, 
albeit
 personally, I feel that the present tendency the world over is to meet the exigencies arising from the seemingly inevitable constant increase of population of all countries, the most important of which is to provide people with lands to cultivate or to live on. To paraphrase the thoughts of Mr. Justice Makalintal in 
ACCFA vs. Confederation of Unions
, G.R. No. L-21484, November 29, 1969, expressed in the quotation contained in the main opinion in this case, here as almost everywhere else the irreversible trend is towards socialization of economic resources. It is my considered view that the task to cope with this challenge of the times is primarily with the political departments of our government and not with the judiciary, more so, when, as in the particular aspect of governmental powers to solve social problems, the Constitution itself more than hints a drift along the universal course I have just pointed out and in unmistakable words allocates such powers to the legislature. I am afraid that if the opinion of my brethren is pursued to its logical conclusion, there is danger that the judiciary may be over-reaching the traditional boundaries of its faculties at the expense of the other departments who should be in a better position than the courts to determine the factual bases of any social action needed at any given time. To the extent however, that Mr. Justice Teehankee holds that the matter of whether or not, in a given case, the expropriation in pursuance of an enabling law expressly stating that it should be for the purpose of subdividing a land for resale to tenants is indeed to be done for that specified objective, I agree with my learned colleague. In other words, in any instance where it is shown that contrary to the assumption of Congress, a land has already been subdivided and all or almost all of it are already the subject of conventional transactions between the owners and the occupants thereof, even if this happens after the enactment of the law and its actual implementation, I would hold that the law is inoperative, or no longer so, but not unconstitutional.


With all due respect to the writer of the main opinion whose prolific pen and capacity to make lengthy dissertations on constitutional rights in the context of the development of political, social and economic forces, from his own point of view and more, from those of great legal and judicial exponents thereof, native and foreign, with more of the latter rather often, is unequalled in this Court, in my humble view, the questions of property rights involved in this case have been so foreclosed in the letter of the constitutional precept itself, in its evident spirit and, if recourse to it is still needed, in the deliberations in the constitutional convention of 1934, as to need any lengthy discussion. On these bases, I consider the specific authority granted under the provision in question as an exception to the Bill of Rights. After all, it is not alone the judiciary that can serve as forum for the objections to the exercise of the power so granted because the landowners concerned can make their representations before Congress which as I have said is in a better position to solve social and economic problems.


No less than two of the foremost legal luminaries known to the bench and bar, Delegates Eusebio Orense of Batangas and Vicente J. Francisco of Cavite reminded their colleagues of the risks to private property right the envisaged congressional authority entailed. Neither their lucid explanations nor their unerring logic could overcome the consensus that was formed after the appeals of Delegates Miguel Cuaderno of Bataan and Florentino Saquin of Zamboanga to the Convention to put an end to the social problems pointed out in the speech of Delegate Cuaderno quoted in the main opinion. Delegate Jose B. Conejero of Albay tried to help the opponents, and subsequent to the session of January 29, 1935 when the attempt to eliminate or emasculate the proposal was debated, in the session of the succeeding day, no less than the vice-president of the convention delivered a privileged speech in a vain effort to turn the tide. So stirring was the impassioned speech of Delegate Ruperto Montinola of Iloilo that Delegate Ruperto Kapunan of Leyte attempted to move for the reconsideration of the action taken by the convention the day before, but again the convention remained immutable. By another parliamentary maneuver, Delegate Eusebio Lopez of Batangas tried to reopen the question and upon being upheld by the chair, occasion arose for Delegates Orense, Filemon Sotto of Cebu, Lopez himself, Jose Locsin of Negros Occidental and Manuel Briones of Cebu to indulge in such an illuminating and instructive debate on practically all aspects of the matter embellished by the complete mastery of language of the speakers, that a reading of these portions of the deliberations should settle all doubts as to where the heart of the convention was. I would have attempted to follow the usual fashion of quoting choice portions to add force and beauty to this opinion, but, I have found the try futile, as it would certainly fail to convey with adequate fidelity the wisdom, the patriotism, the social consciousness and the fullsome comprehensiveness of the consensus that prevailed, and rather than risking the pitfall of projecting individual opinions of particular members, no matter how prominent and prestigious in talent and love of country or social activism, as the intent of the convention as a whole, and in order also that all those who may read the decision and the separate opinions in this case may examine them from a fairer perspective, and more importantly, so that those who are apprehensive and jittery about the forthcoming constitutional convention may have an insight into how Filipinos, once given the responsibility, truly act as such, with only the interest of the nation upper-most in their minds and hearts, I am making as an annex of this opinion and an integral part hereof, a scanned Ricohfax copy of the complete record of the deliberations I have mentioned above which took place on January 29 and 30, 1935 on the floor of the constitutional convention of 1934, as they are reported in Vol. VI, pp. 533 to 594 (excluding pp. 559-564) of the Proceedings of the Philippine Constitutional Convention by laurel. Indeed, no portion of this debate should be lost to history and our posterity.


It may just as well be also stated, at this juncture, in the interest of historical truth, that the social philosophy underlying the constitutional provision herein involved is neither new nor purely indigenous. Truth to tell, the idea of opening public agricultural lands for acquisition, without compensation in the case of natives who are actual occupants thereof, or lease by individuals and corporations, with such limited areas as to afford as many persons as possible the opportunity to enjoy such privilege of acquiring or leasing was already in the first legislative organic law of this country, the Philippine Bill of 1902, enacted by the American Congress. (Secs. 14 and 15) Anent the expropriation of private lands, the Philippine Bill of 1902, in its Section 64 already ""authorized"" the government to exercise the right of eminent domain ""in respect of any lands, easements, appurtenances and hereditaments which, on the thirteenth of August, eighteen hundred and ninety eight, were owned or held by associations, corporations, communities, religious orders, or private individuals in such large tracts or parcels of land and in such manner as in the opinion of the Commission injuriously affect the peace and welfare of the people of the Philippine Islands"" and our present Constitution provides parallelly in Sec. 4, Art. XIII, that ""the Congress may authorize, upon payment of just compensation, the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at costs to individuals.""


I would like to close by saying that I consider it necessary to view the question before Us beyond its socio-economic aspect as such, and to realize that fundamentally what the Constitution envisages in the precept under discussion is to bring soonest possible to a reality the slogan of land to the landless. In the jargon of the activists, the accomplishment of this end is no longer an open option for us, it, is an irreversible commitment unmistakably written by our constituent fathers.


EXCERPTS FROM THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE

PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AS 

COMPILED BY DR. JOSE P. LAUREL
 **


Parece que hay enmiendas por supresion del Articulo nueve. Haganse constar los nombres de dichas enmiendas.


VARIOS DELEGADOS. Para un turno en pro. Para un turno en contra.


EL PRESIDENTE. Que dice el Comite?


SR. LOCSIN. No aceptamos.


SR. ROXAS. Señor Presidente, para una aclaracion a los proponentes de la enmienda. Habria objecion de que se subdivida esta enmienda por supresion, porque el articulo envuelve dos proposiciones: la primera es facultar a la Asamblea Nacional para que determine la extension de terreno que un particular o una corporation pueda adquirir: la segunda parte permits al gobierno expropiar grandes latifundios o terrenos; pero subdivididos a los terrantenientes y vendidos al precio de 
cost
, si el bien publico lo demands, mediante compensacion.


Señor Presidente, yo propongo la mocion de que se subdivida la enmienda por supresion; que la primera parte tenga por objeto la supresion de las palabras 
The National Legislative may determine by law
 y que la segunda parte de la enmienda tenga por objeto la supresion de las siguientes palabras: It may authorize the expropriation of lands. No he hecho mas que una proposicion de que se subdivida la enmienda y pido que se vote.


EL PRESIDENTE. Si no hay objecion, se hard asi. (
No hubo objecion
.) Esta en order la mocion para suprimir la primera parte de la disposicion.


MR. SEVILLA. Mr. President, I rise for a parliamentary inquiry. I have an amendment to Section 9 for the partial suppression of a word in said section — the word ""individuals"". I want to know from the Chair, if the amendment for the suppression of the entire section is lost, what will happen with my amendment?


THE PRESIDENT. If the Assembly will vote maintaining this clause, you can present your amendment.


MR. VINZONS. I move that there will be no debate on this question and that the voting be nominal.


EL PRESIDENTE. Tiene la palabra el Delegado por Batangas.


SR. ORENSE. Señor Presidents; Caballeros. En mi humilde opinion, debe suprimirse esta facultad que se concede a la Asamblea Nacional para limitar la extension de los terrenos agricolas privados que de boy en adelante puede adquirir cualquier individuo corporacion o association. Es para mi esta disposicion causa por la cual morira toda iniciativa, todo incentive en el trabajo o en la labor que un individuo debe ejercer para adquirir una propiedad y poder luego gozar de ella una vez adquirida con el sudor de su frente para despues legal a sus seres queridos. Si vamos a limitar o vamos a conceder esta facultad que Ileva consigo la limitacion de la propiedad que puede un individuo, corporacion o association adquirir, tendremos aun que muchos de nuestros terreinos incultos uedardn an mas in cultos de lo que estrin Creo que debemos propulsar, facilitar medios para que esas grandes extensiones de terreno que aparecen incultos e improductives, lo sean de hoy en adelante porque los necesita la nacion. Pido, pues a vosotxos que vosotros por la supresion de esta primera parte y tambien de la segunda parte, cuando la votemos.


(
El presidente a las 6:14 p.m. cede la presidencia al Primer Vice Presidente, senor Montinola
.)


SR. SAGUIN. Señor Presidente, yo he pedido un turno en contra de la supresion.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. Tiene la palabra el Delegado Sr. Saguin.


SR. SAGUIN. Señor Presidente, yo creo que la misma filosofia que tiene la disposicion de nuestra Constitution limitado la adquisition de terrenos publicos, muy bien Puede invocarse en lo que respecta a la adquisition de propiedades privados. La razon primordial porque nosotros fijamos un limite en la adquisicion de terrencs publicos es bien conocida por todos; evitar quegrandes propiedades o grandes latifundios, como se ha dicho aqui queden en manos de unas cuantos personas, privando a las generaciones futuras del derecho de adquirir parte de esas propiedades.


Con respecto a las propiedades privados, yo creo debe militar la misma razon. Si nuestra idea es que las propiedades en nuestro pais esten distribuidas de tal manera que el mayor numero posible de sus habitantes tenga medios suficientes para vivir, yo creo que esta limitacion es muy sabia. Quizas no sentiriamos la necesidad de esta limitacion en el estado actual en que nos encontramos, porque todavia existen muchos terrenos que podemos disponer. Pero, al redactor esta constitucion, crea que tenemos la vision puesta no solamente en el estado actual, sino que en lo que va a venir.


SR. CONFESOR. Sr. Presidente, para una pregunta al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. SAGUIN. Si señor.


SR. CONFESOR. No es verdad de que las grandes agitaciones radicales por partes de los Ilamados 
sakdatistas
 y comunistas tienen lugar en los grandes latifundios de Nueva Ecija, Laguna, Pangasinan, y Bataan?


SR. SAGUIN. Yo creo que si. Ademas, si hemos de aprender algo de las lecciones de otras naciones mas adelantadas que nosotros, mas viejas que nosotros, yo creo que la experiencia de las otras naciones nos demuestran que en ellas las propiedades estin bien divididas, y por eso, son las naciones mas estables, son las naciones que sienten menos convulsiones que estin menos expuestas a las revoluciones.


SR. ORENSE Sr. Presidente, para algunas preguntas al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. SAGUIN. Si señor.


SR. ORENSE. No cree S.S. que las leyes contra los latifundios solamente se han promulgado en aquelos paises en donde la poblacion es mas densa que la extension de los terrenos?


SR. SAGUIN. Yo creo que es mucho mas oportuno adoptar una legislacion semejante en nuestro, pais, porque hasta ahora no tenemos ese problema agudo, y tenemos que prever por que puede suceder; de tal suerte que podemos hacer ya una distribucion mas equitativa desde hoy de nuestros terrenos para que en el futuro no tengamos ese problema que existe en otras naciones. Como medida preventiva, yo creo que esta disposicion es muy sabia.


SR. ORENSE. Supongamos que la Legislatura adopte esta provision y la Legislature, verbigracia, dicte una ley diciendo; ningun individuo ni corporacion o asociacion podra adquirir terreno agricola privado, cuya extension page de quinientas o mil hectareas. Se dicta esta ley. Existen actualmente particulares, lo mismo que corporaciones extranjeras poseedoras de terrenos agricolas privados cuya extensiones aun mayor. Si estas corporaciones por necesidades o por imperatives del negocio, tuvieran que liquidar y una asociacion filipina quisiera adquirir, por tener mas de quinientas hectareas esa hacienda, esa asociacion filipina no pueda adquirirla, tendramos que tragar a esa asociacion extranjera?


SR. SAGUIN. En vez de adquirir una asociacion filipina, pues que la adquiera dos asociaciones filipinas, dividiendo la propiedad grande hasta el limite fijado por la ley.


SR. ORENSE. Como quedarian por otra parte, los derechos adquiridos por esa corporacion por ese dueno, que ha adquirido la propiedad bajo un estado de derecho constituido? Vamos a vulnerar tambien esos derechos?


SR. SAGUIN. No creo yo que estaran afectados porque esta disposicion no se dicta para las propiedades actuales, sino para las adquisiciones futures de propiedades.


SR. ORENSE. Pero el caso es que para una adquisicion futura de una propiedad que exceda de quinientas hectareas o de mil hectarea porque es el limite que ha puesto la Legislatura ...


SR. SAGUIN. No hay prohibicion en la venta. La prohibicion aqui es la adquisicion en vez de un comprador para esa propiedad de mil hectareas tendremos dos compradores de quinientas hectareas cada una. No cree S.S. que eso es mejor?


SR. ORENSE Entonces, S.S. patrocina la idea de una comunidad porque puede haber dos, tres, cuatro o cinco compradores, y entonces S.S. patrocinaria de intereses, y con ello S.S. patrocina una teoria que linda con el comunismo.


SR. SAGUIN. No es necesariamente la consecuencia.


SR. CUADERNO. Sr. Presidente para una pregunta al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. SAGUIN. Si señor.


SR. CUADERNO. No es verdad que en las provincias donde existen grandes latifundios, la experiencia siempre ha demostrado que los intereses de los terratenientes han sido siempre sacrificados?


SR. SAGUIN. Eso es lo que tengo entendido.


SR. CUADERNO. Y por eso, debemos evitar que ocurra eso?


SR. SAGUIN. Yo creo que si. Ademis tener en cuenta que esta disposicion no es mandatoria a la Asamblea, Nacional, sino que es una facultad que se le concede para que pueda adoptar una legislacion de semejante naturaleza que sirva de arma para remediar el mal. De modo que puede o no adoptarse por la Asamblea Nacional, segun convengan a las circunstancias.


SR. ORENSE. Sr. Presidente, para otras preguntas al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. SAGUIN. Si, señor.


SR. ORENSE. Segun esta disposicion, no cree S.S. que la Asamblea Nacional en el ejercicio de sus poderes no tendra esta facultad en el ejercicio de lo que Ilaman
 police power
?


SR. SAGUIN. Yo creo que no, porque seria entonces contrario al 
bill
 de derechos que todos nosotros sabemos. Es preciso dar una facultad a la Legislature, para que, en un memento dado de nuestra historia pueda tener la oportunidad de prevenir el mal de que caigan en manos de unas cuantas personas grandes latifundios.


SR. ORENSE. No cree S.S., ademas, que esta disposicion es antagonica al principio enunciado en el 
bill of rights
 sobre el derecho de propiedad?


SR. SAGUIN. Si es antagonica, debe ser una excepcion de la regla. La disposicion del 
bill
 de derechos es la regla general, y esta es una excepcion.


SR. ORENSE. No cree S.S. que a menos que se diga expresamente que es una excepcion, siendo esta una disposicion posterior, bajo la regla de hermenuetica legal, de que la disposicion posterior anula la anterior, quedaria por los suelos el enunciado de principios de 
bill of rights
?


SR. SAGUIN. No lo entiendo asi, hay un principio en hermeneutica legal de que una disposicion particular en frente de una disposicion general, la disposicion particular prevalece en un caso dado.


SR. ORENSE. Pero no acaba de decir S.S. que con esta disposicion no se quiere dar mis que un enunciado de un principio, por el cual debe regir la Asamblea Nacional?


SR. SAGUIN. Es una facultad que se concede a la Asamblea Nacional. Sin esa facultad, probablemente, la Asamblea Nacional no podra adoptar leyes semejantes.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) Tiene la palabra el Caballero por Albay, Sr. Conejero.


SR. CONEJERO. Sr. Presidente, debo comenzar por decirles que yo no tengo ningun latifundio, porque mi familia apenas me ha dejado unas cuantos hectareas que apenas bastan para sostenerme. Pero yo me atrevo a hablar en contra de esta disposicion, porque la creo absurda. Yo entiendo que ninguna debe ser castigado por el solo pecado de haber trabajado mas que otros o haber sido mis industrioso que los demas.


SR. CUENCO. Para un turno en contra, Sr. Presidente.


SR. CONEJERO. (
Prosiguiendo
). No veo ninguna razon para que se pueda impedir a ningun individuo a que desarrolle lo que buenamente pueda por sus esfuerzos y sus trabajo, Que culpa tiene uno que ha adquirida o ha heredado una fortuna de sus padres para que se le prive despues tener mas o menos extension de terreno? Porque Sefiores, yo entiendo que es altamente injusto el privar a un individuo el que pueda desarrollarse como mejor le a entender su trabajo y sus fuerzas. Precisamente es ordinario el premiar al que trabaja y castigar al indolente, y con esta disposicion hacemos lo contrario, pues hasta al que trabaja vamos a castigarle, impidiendole que pueda adquirir mas de lo que vamos a poner en la Constitucion. Esto es para mi un absurdo, y con eso entiendo que debe borrarse esto de la Constitucion. He dicho.


SR. BRIONES. Senor Presidente, no se cual va a ser mi posicion parlamentaria en esta cuestion. Yo estoy a favor de que se retenga esta precepto que dice: 
The National Legislature may determine by law the size of agricultural land which individuals, corporations, or associations may hereafter acquire
. Yo estoy conforme con esta proposicion de 
may hereafter acquire
: pero deseo la supresion de las palabras 
and hold
.


VARIOS DELEGADOS. Es igual.


SR. BRIONES. Hay bastante diferencia, Sr. Presidente. Yo estoy conforme con que el Estado filipino formule ya una politica restrictiva de los grandes latifundios en el sentido de que en el futuro, la Asamblea Nacional pueda determinar la medida o la extension que las corporaciones o individuos puedan adquirir. Ahora, no estaria conforme con que se retengan las palabras and hold, porque esto tendria realmente el efecto de vulnerar derechos adquiridos.Y creo que, por lo menos, personalmente mi opinion seria que se respeten derechos adquiridos o posesiones actuales; pero que se prohiban ya las adquisiciones en el futuro, cuando exceda cierto limite. Creo que esa es la politica intermedia, discreta que puede adoptar la Asamblea Nacional.


SR. YSIP. Señor Presidente, para algunas preguntas al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. BRIONES. Si señor.


SR. YSIP. Quiere decir S.S. que patrocina la supresion de las palabras 
and hold
?


SR. BRIONES. Nada mas que esas palabras. El efecto de su supresion es solamente respetar los derechos adquiridos ahora. La Asamblea podra bajo este precepto, si se suprimen las palabras 
and hold
, determinar la extension de hectareas que puedan ser adquiridas por corporaciones o individuos.


SR. YSIP. De modo que esa idea de S.S. la expone en forma de una enmienda por supresion.


SR. BRIONES. Mas bien es un
 perfecting amendment
 ...


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. Esa enmienda no esta en orden todavia.


MR. VINZONS. Mr. President, just an aclaration over that point. The provision says that ""may hereafter acquire and hold."" Don't you believe that by the term ""hereafter"" the rights now vested in individuals, corporations and associations are sufficiently protected without omitting the word ""hold""?


SR. BRIONES. No, esa es mi duda; que la Asamblea Nacional, si se mantienen las palabras and hold, pueda decir, por ejemplo, tal corporacion tiene mil hectareas actualmente, y por lo tanto, puede hacer que se reduzca la extension de terreno que puedan poseer las corporaciones, en cuyo caso, aquellos que estuvieran poseyendo mayor extension de lo que provea la ley, de aprobarse esto por la Asamblea Nacional podrian ser afectados. Esa es mi duda, nada mas.


MR. VINZONS. But the ""holding"" there refers also to the word ""hereafter"". It is a question of interpretation.


SR. BRIONES. Es cuestion de interpretacion.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. Tiene la palabra el Delegado por Iloilo.


MR. CONFESOR. Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention: To me this is a very timely provision in our Constitution. It embodies a high sense of statesmanship on the part of the Committee that wrote this draft with respect to the limitation of landholdings of individuals and corporations. We must use our sense of observation, gentlemen of the Convention, in arguing in favor or against this draft. We are hearing today that in Spain, a tremendous revolution is taking place. Radical movements, radical uprisings are being noted daily in that new republic. And if we trace the root of the evil, we will find out that the big landholdings in Spain are the root-cause of the radical movements that are taking place in that new republic. Big Russia! Whatis the root-cause of communism in that Bolshevik Republic — big land holdings.Mexico is yearly disturbed by revolution due to what? To big landholdings. History is very clear in this regard — that big landholdings always bring about oppression. It always brings about abuses. Consequently, it produces discontent, which eventually ripens into revolutionary movements. Now, we should adopt this provision in our Constitution to avoid those eventualities of social disturbances. We must use the method of prevention instead of cure,with respect to these social problems.


SR. SALAZAR (V.). Señor Presidente para unas preguntas al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. El orador puede contester si le place.


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor.


SR. SALAZAR (V.). Esta disposicion faculta a la Asamblea Nacional para limitar la propiedad individual. No es asi?


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor.


SR. SALAZAR (V.). Bien S.S. compredera que se puede adquirir una propiedad mediante compra o mediante herencia. Supongase que la Asamblea Nacional limitase la propiedad privada a 300 hectareas, y S.S. que tiene ya 300 hectareas, heredase de su padre al morir una propiedad que tiene 600 hectareas. S.S. se veria privador de recibir por herencia esa propiedad, porque pasa del limite?


SR. CONFESOR. Si pasa, puede vender la mitad antes de morir.


SR. SALAZAR (V.). Si pero si se muere antes de vender a quien se ha de entregar la herencia? al gobierno?


SR. CONFESOR. El caballero por Leyte debe leer muy bien el precepto, en al sentido de que no puede ser adquirido por el gobierno o por cualquiera una propiedad sin justa compensacion. Asi es que si se puede dar a los herederos 300 hectareas solamente, y si el gobierno decide quedarse con las otras 300, el gobierno debe pagar.


MR. SOBREPEÑA. Is it not true that the acquisitive instinct of man does not know any limitation?


MR. CONFESOR. That is true.


MR.SOBREPERA. Oftentimes that acquisitive instinct of man conflicts with the welfare of society.


MR. CONFESOR. That is true. I cited historical cases to prove that, in Spain, Russia, Mexico and Cuba.


MR. SOBREPEÑA. Is it not true also that it is the un,equal possession of property that is often the cause of domestic instability?


MR. CONFESOR. Very true.


MR. SOBREPEÑA. And to eliminate that instability, and to continue tranquility in the land, there must be at least equal possession of property?


MR. CONFESOR. That is true.


MR. GRAGEDA. Will the gentleman yield?


MR. CONFESOR. Surely.


MR. GRAGEDA. The question is this: For example you are a very rich man and you have five hundred hectares of land; but according to law passed by the Legislature, no man must hold more than 500 hectares of land. Here is a poor man with ten hectares of land. He has nobody to sell it to except you. But you cannot acquire it because you will be then acquiring more than what is permitted by law, and therefore, this person will be deprived of the right to sell that land to you. In that case, will not the law be oppressive?


MR. CONFESOR. Therein lies the wisdom of this provision because the state prohibits him, that poor man, to alienate his property. As a matter of fact, it is protecting this man by preventing him from alienating his property to the richer man.


MR. GRAGEDA. But for example, he needs to sell his property in order to maintain himself and his family, and you are willing to pay a good price for that. In that case, will not the law be oppressive to the poor man?


MR. CONFESOR. Precisely for that very reason, this provision is proposed to be inserted in this Constitution to deprive that man of his landholding.


MR. CABILI. You said that this provision in the Constitution would, to some extent, prevent or suppress communistic or revolutionary tendency?


MR. CONFESOR. Yes.


MR. CABILI. Don't you think that this provision in the Constitution would promote revolutionary movement in the Philippines because it would encourage communist leaders to propagate that the people should vote for them because once elected, they will work that lands should be sub-divided?


MR. CONFESOR. As a matter of fact, provision is an antidote to socialistic movement. Now there are agitations and there are violent agitations to sub-divide big landed estates because those people have no recourse to legal and peaceful means. Now we provide for a legal and peaceful means of sub-dividing big landed estates.


MR. CABILI. Precisely because there is an incentive or encouragement. Because of the provision of the Constitution here, it would promote revolutionary movement, because there is a greater belief that if the people want them, they would work for such provision.


MR. CONFESOR. I don't agree with the gentleman from Lanao.


MR. SEVILLA. Does not the gentleman believe that for the same reason that under Section 9, the last sentence authorizes the government to expropriate land, there is no necessity for limiting the size of agricultural lands which any private person may acquire because the government may expropriate his land?


MR. CONFESOR. The first part is a compliment of the second part.


MR. SEVILLA. But the second part make useless the first part?


MR. CONFESOR. The first part is a necessary counterpart of the second part.


MR. SEVILLA. But don't you think that if the government is given authority to expropriate land, there is no necessity for limiting the size of agricultural lands, because the government is given authority to expropriate?


MR. CONFESOR. The government inquires the necessity of the individual to expropriate any landed estate. Now, there is no necessity because there is that preventive measure on the part of the government to limit the size of the land.


MR. SEVILLA. That is precisely my point. There is no necessity for the preventing measure because the government is authorized to expropriate the estate of the individual. 


MR. CONFESOR. What we want is to avoid the process of expropriation if possible, by limiting the size of the landed estate.


MR. SEVILLA. You want to avoid the process of expropriations, why insert in Section 9 then?


MR. CONFESOR. It is a necessary compliment.


MR. SEVILLA. Mr. President, I do not get the point of the gentleman.


SR. PAREDES. No es verdad, senor Confesor, que en varias partes de Filipinas hay individuos que son propietarios de grandes latifundios?


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor, eso es verdad.


SR. PAREDES. Y segun esa disposicion, esos individuos permanecerin siendo propietarlos de esos grandes latifundios?


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor.


SR. PAREDES. Y segun esa disposicion, los individuos que nazcan desde ahora no podrian adquirir grandes latifundios, como esos grandes latifundios que pertenecen a esos individuos privilegiados?


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor. Vamos a evitar la condicion que existe ahora en Dinalupihan, en que cada afio hay alli casi una revuelta entre los terratenientes.


SR. PAREDES. No cree Su Senoria ahora que con eso habra un desigualdad de clases?


SR. CONFESOR. No, señor.


SR. PAREDES. Los que nazcan desde hay, aunque quieran tener grandes terrenos, no podrin, tenerlos, en cambio: los que hacieron ayer permaneceran en sus grandes propiedades. No cree Su Senoria que habra una revolucion?


SR. CONFESOR. No, señor.


SR. CONEJERO. Entiendo que Su Senorita favorece la primera parte, por lo menos del Articulo 9, no es asi?


SR. CONFESOR. Si senor.


SR. CONEJERO. Permitame Su Sefioria poner un ejemplo: Su Senoria, como buen trabajador, consigue amazar, digamoslo asi, por ejemplo, 5000 hectareas de terreno. Nosotros vamos a limitar a 1,000 hectareas lo que puede adquirir una persona privada. Su Senoria no llega a tener mas que un hijo. Como se ven a quedar las 4000 hectareas que quedan de sobran de lo que tiene Su Senoria, porque su hijo no puede heredar mas que 1,000 hectareas?


SR. CONFESOR. Voy a contestar esa pregunta dandole a Su Senoria, un ejemplo practico, pero en la forma inversa. Hay un pueblo o hay un municipio en Pangasinan que esta poseido por una familia solamente; eso quiere decir que los miembros de esa familia solamente tienen terrenos donde levantar sus casas o sus manciones, pero en ese municipio, fuera de esa familia, ninguno tiene ni un pedazo de terreno donde caerse muerto, quiere Su Senoria que se prevalezea esa condicion en ese municipio?


EL PRESIDENTE. El tiempo del orador ya ha expirado.


DISCURSO EN CONTRA DEL SR. FRANCISCO


SR. FRANCISCO. Señor Presidente.


EL PRESIDENTE. Señor Delegado por Cavite.


SR. FRANCISCO. Caballeros de la Convencion: Antes de discutir la enmienda, permitame que llame la atencion de esta Asamblea hacia el Articulo 10 del draft, que dice: ""Ningun terreno agricola o propiedad particular se podra transferer o enagenar o ceder a ninguna personal, corporacion o asociacion que no estuviese qualificada para adquirir terrenos publicos en las Islas Filipinas."" De modo que tenemos ya aqui una disposicion que hace imposible que propiedades particulares, de grandes extensiones, puedan pasar a manos extranjeras. Pero no obstante esta disposicion, por medio del parrafo 1, Articulo 9, se trata de conceder a las Legislatura facultad para determinar por ley la extension de terrenos, privados que puede adquirir o poseer corporaciones o asociaciones, de hoy en adelante.


Caballeros de la Convencion: Yo no estoy opuesto a que se provea de todas las garantias o restricciones en cuanto a la adquisicion de terrenos publicos, pero yo digo que debemos ir con cuidado en inmiscuirse en los derechos privados. Por medio de la disposicion que se discute, a mi modo de ver, se trata de involucrar el derecho o la libertad de la propiedad particular tan fundamental como el derecho a la vida. La libertad de la propiedad es una consecuencia includible el derecho a la vida. Cada hombre es libre de adquirir, conserver, gozar y disponer de los bienes que constituyen su patrimonio. Considero que esa disposicion es un atentado al derecho de la propiedad, y digo que es un atentado al derecho de la propiedad por los casos practicos que se han expuesto ante esta Asamblea. Supongamos que, debido a la limitacion de la produccionn del azucar, los agricultores del Sur, duenos de grandes extenones, no pudiesen cultivar sus terrenos, plantar azucar, y quisiesen vender sus terrenos a los agricultores del Norte para dedicarlos al cultivo del palay, y supongamos que la Asamblea promulga una ley prohibieiado que se pueda enajenar o poseer terrenos en una extension de 300 hectareas, que pasarian a los agricultores del Sur, que no pueden plantar azucar en sus terrenos, o no estando en condiciones economicas para cultivar sus terrenos, se les privari de vender sus propiedades a los agricultores del Norte? Que pasarian, si un hombre, por ejemplo, no pudiendo cultivar su terreno se viera en la necesidad, para vivir, de vender el terreno que posee,y ese terreno supongamos que excediera de 300 hectareas, y la Legislatura o la Asamblea dijera que no se podra adquirir terrenos por mas de 300 hectareas.Que pasaria a ese individuo? El resultado seria que ese individuo no tendria mas remedio que abandonar el terren no tendria ni para pagar el amillaramiento, cual seria el resultado de esta? No pudiendo el individuo pagar siquiera el amillaramiento, el gobierno no tendria otra cosa que hacer que embarcar esa propiedad, y en resumidas cuentas, en vez de que esa propiedad pasara a manos de un tercero para que pueda cultivarla y pagar el amillaramiento de la misma al gobierno, el resultado seria que el dueno se quedari con ese terreno sin poder cultivarlo y Sin poder pagar su contribucion al gobierno. Tenemos el caso planteado aqui de un padre de familia que tiene una propiedad extensa, supongamos de mil hectareas: la Asamblea o la Legislatura promulga una ley que prohibe la adquisicion o posesion por una persona de mas de 300 hectareas, y ese padre de familia quiere mejorar a un hijo suyo, que es al unico a quien quiere dejar todas sus propiedades; si esas propiedades excedieran de 300 hectareas, por el limite fijado por la Legislature, que pasaria a esa propiedad, o con el exceso de esa propredad, o en otras palabras, cual seria el 
status
 de esa propiedad? Podriamos obligar al gobierno a que expropie esa propiedad, o sea, las 700 hectareas restantes? Como se puede obligar al gobierno a que expropie esa propiedad? Ustedes saben muy bien que bajo el 
Bill of Rights
, dos son log requisites de expropiacion: primero necesidad, publica y segundo compensacion justa. Si el gobierno necesita de esa propiedad, que pasara con esa propiedad, cual sera su 
status
? Aqui se ha hablado de latifundio, pero entiendo que no existe latifundio aqui tal como esta palabra se entiende, poseer 500 hectareasde terreno no constituye latifundio, El latifundio es un problema en Mejico y en los Estados Subamericanos, pero aqui, en Filipinas, no existe tal problemas; y si bien es verdad que algunos creen que por medio de esa disposicion se ha de impedir que algunas corporaciones extranjeras posean grandes extensiones de terreno, yo pregunto: es esta disposicion el remedio para impedir que esas corporaciones sigan poseyendo esos latifundios o extensiones grandes de terreno? Por que puede ser este el remedio? Si nadie puede adquirir mis que la extension que fija la ley, supongamos 300 hectareas,y una corporacion extranjera mil o dos mil hectareas quien comprara esa propiedad? El gobierno puede comprar, aqui dicen. Bajo que disposicion? Estamos discutiendo la primera disposicion, y al discutir la primera disposicion se ha pedido el consentimiento de esta Asamblea para que esta disicion sea independiente o se discuta independientemente de la segunda disposicion. Si el gobierno quiere expropiar, crea que debe atenerse a la disposicion del 
Bill of Rights
, o sea, debe expropiar mediante justa compensacion y mediante razones de necesidad publica. Pero debemos tener una valla cuando se trata de terrenos o derechos privados y creo que es suficiente valla lo dispuesto en el Bill of Rights, mantengamos el 
Bill of Rights
 tal como existe y no creo yo que sea justo que nosotros aprobemos esa disposicion que, a mi juicio envuelve una cuestion fundamental cual es al del del individuo a la libertad y propiedad.


SR. NAVARRO. Su Senoria dijo que en Filipinas no existen latifundios.


SR. FRANCISCO. Ante todo quisiera saber de Su Senoria que entiende por grandes latifundios?


SR. NAVARRO. Precisamente usted hablo de la latifundios, quisiera saber de Su Senoria si una hacienda de veinticuatro mil hectareas poseida por una corporacion no es latifundio?


SR. FRANCISCO. Yo entiendo que no es latifundio: latifundio en Mexico y en la America del Sur son extensiones de doscientos mil hectareas.


SR. NAVARRO. En que diccionario se encuentra eso.


SR. FRANCISCO. Si no se encuentra en aln diccionario, tampoco podria encontrarse latifundios en extensiones de veinticuatro mil hectareas.


SR. NAVARRO. No recuerda Su Senoria que al inaugurarse el gobierno filipino bajo la administracion de los Estados Unidos, una de las principales medidas que adopte el Gobierno de Filipinas es la adquisicion de la hacienda de los frailes para ser distribuida entre los filipinos?


SR. FRANCISCO. La pregunta del companero, senor Navarro, si no es verdad que al inaugurarse el Gobierno de las Islas Filipinas lo primera que hizo fud adquirir la hacienda del los frailes. Me alegro que se me haya hecho esa pregunta. Bien, es verdad; pero esa facultad concedida a la Legislatura para promulgar leyes que adquieran las haciendas de los frailes estaba basada en una disposicion de la ley del Congreso de 1902, que requiere como requisite dos cosas primero que esos terrenos deben ser terrenos de grandes extensiones y segunda voy a leer la ley mismo con respecto a la segunda parte: ""que a juicio de la Comission Civil sea perjudicial a la paz y bienestar el gobierno filipino,"" condiciones estas que no existen en el 
draft
 que ahora se somete a la consideracion de ustedes.


SR. NAVARRO. No recuerda Su Senoria que en las instrucciones del Presidente McKinley a la Comission Civil se mencionaba precisamente que la posesion de grandes haciendas por las corporaciones religiosas es una de las causas de la revolucion contra el Gobierno Español y recomendaba el Presidente McKinley la adquisicion de esas haciendas?


SR. FRANCISCO. Yo admito que cuando la posesion de grandes extensiones de terreno constituyen una amenaza a la paz y el bienestar del Gobierno de Filipinas, el Gobierno debe tener derecho de adquirir esas extensiones de terreno para revenderlas a los particulares, pero este no es el caso en el precepto que nosotros discutimos. En el precepto que nosotros discutimos se dice sencillamente lo siguiente:






Sec. 9.	The National Legislature may determine by law the size of private agricultural land which individuals, corporations, or associations may hereafter acquire and hold. It may authorize the expropriation of lands to be thereafter subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to individuals.






Nada mas Convietase esto en el lenguaje en que esta redactado el 
bill
 de Filipinas y quizas podremos considerar, estariamos mas inclinados a sostener el draft que no tal como esta ahora, porque ahora podria occurrirsele a la Legislatura aprobar un 
bill
 en el sentido de que una persona no podria poseer mis que doscientos hectareas, no pueda poseer mas que trescientas hectareas, sin ninguna restriccion o modificacion y eso no esta bien cuando se trata de propiedad particular individual.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. El Comite va a cerrar el debate.


MR. CUADERNO. Mr. President, this will be my last speech in the Convention. And I just want to remind the Convention of the first speech that I delivered — the first speech I delivered before this Assembly. I believe, Mr. President, that one of the best provisions that this draft of the Constitution contains is this provision that will prevent the repetition of the history of misery, of trials and tribulations of the poor tenants throughout the length and breadth of the Philippine Islands. I am a living witness to the sufferings of thousands of people that live in and around the big landed estates. Delegates elected in the provinces and living in Manila ignore completely the sufferings that these people and their children have undergone from the time of Rizal; and the gentleman from Batangas says ""no"". I want to read the novels of Rizal decrying the fate of these poor people of the big landed estates.


THE PRESIDENT. Time is up.


MR. VINZONS. I move that a nominal voting be made. This is an important question.


(
En este momenta el Vice Presidente, Sr. Montinola, abandons el estrado, ocupandolo el Presidente, Hon. Claro M. Recto
.)


SR. CONEJERO. Para una cuestion privilegiada. Pido que se levante la sesion. Ya son las siete.


EL PRESIDENTE. La hora reglamentaria es hasta a las ocho.


Puede votarse la enmienda?


MR. VINZONS. Mr. President I move that the votation be nominal.


EL PRESIDENTE. La Mesa desea saber si hay numero suficiente que apoye la mocion.


Los que esten conformes con la mocion que se pongan de pie. (
Varios Sres. Delegado se ponen de pie
.)


Hay numero suficiente que apoya la mocion.


Lease la lista.


Los que conformes con la supresion de la primera parte de este articulo contestaran si. .Los que no lo esten contestaran no.

DELEGATE SEVILLA IN CONNECTION 

WITH SEC. 7


MR. SEVILLA. Mr. President: We are witnessing today the last political act of a great and generous nation in behalf of a weak but grateful people. In this most difficult hour of our Destiny, we, who have been privileged by Fate to frame and weave the Great Document that shall proclaim to the world the birth of a new nation conceived in the mutual faith and trust of two peoples, have in our hands the delicate task of seeing to it that this gem of our handicraft will not only be the bulwark of our liberties, but also the anchorage of the peace, happiness and welfare of our posterity. We have the lesson of the Past for our guidance; we have the problems of the present for our solution; and still we have the hazards of the unknown Future to safeguard and to protect ourselves and our children against.


God, in His Infinite Charity, has endowed our people with a patrimony of 155,000 square miles of islands, rich in minerals and abounding in natural resources. So rich are they have been a perpetual source of invitation to foreign avarice and temptation. A brief review of history shows us that they already have been the subject of several conquest and reconquest by foreign nations ever since the days of Magellan, Limahong, and Dewey. But the brown people, weak as it is, served its first notice to the world of ""The Philippines for the Filipinos alone"" ever since that day when the brave little warriors of Mactan heroically gave their lives for the defense and preservation of their territory. Spain brought us her religion and taught us the existence of God; but while we were looking up towards Heaven for the salvation of our souls, our lands were quickly disappearing beneath our feet. Subquently when Admiral Dewey landed the American marines on the shores of Manila Bay, their motives were misconstrued by the natives, who by this time have already reconquered their lost dominion; and for the second time the brown man hoisted his notice of ""The Philippines for the Filipinos alone,"" until the last guerrilla warfare was subdued by experienced soldiery and superior force of arms. In the Treaty of Paris, however, the extensive landholdings of the religious orders were recognized, thereby preserving the last distasteful relic of Spanish subjugation.


The doctrine however, of the ""The Philippines for the Filipinos"" was recognized by the United States more than once, not only in President McKinley's Instruction to the Philippine Commission, but also in the Philippine Bill of 1902, in the Jones Law of 1916, and finally, in the Tydings McDuffie Law. And now that the tutelage of the American Republic is coming to an end, now that we shall become the Great American Trustee, it is time we should renew our pledge to that sublime doctrine written with Lapu-lapu's blood for the first time at Mactan and subsequently rewritten with Gregorio del Pilar's at Tirad Pass, no longer through the shedding of blood and sacrifice in lives of our people, but simply through an enunciation in our fundamental law, which we now have the privilege of drafting, of a provision for the nationalization of our lands and natural resources.


Mr. President, history has taught us that economic vassalage of one nation by another is worse than political slavery. Such a state of affairs invariably breeds discontent among the natives of the servient, country and engenders mutual distrust among their citizens. It is inimical to domestic tranquility and is a hatching ground for international complications; hence, dangerous to the peace of humanity. No nation can have political security and stability if her citizens do not enjoy absolute freedom and prosperity and these are impossible in a country whose natural resources and public domain are controlled by a foreign master. As if a challenge hurled at the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our race, the Filipino nation is being hatched today in the midst of an economic turmoil, in a world gone mad for economic supremacy where the primitive law of the survival of the fittest seems to be the only code between nations.


Just a little north of the Philippines is a powerful industrial Empire whose machines perpetually hum the eternal clamor for more raw materials, which in other words means more land. The perpetual drome of her machines is being heard far and wide, in the remotest corners of the world, because she is engaged in a huge international competition of outselling all others in every available market of the globe. She would brook no interference, and sometimes would respect no international law to achieve her purposes. She justifies her acts by invoking the first law of nature — self-preservation.


The Philippine Islands today has still an extensive area of nearly 30 million hectares of public lands of which but 1/5 have felt the touch of human hands. The rest are still lying idle in tropical fertility which if worked and cultivated can supply most any of the raw material needed by any industrial nation and capable of supplying the needs of a hundred million people. The disposition of these lands are at present governed by the so-called Act No. 2874 of the Philippine Legislature. By this Act only the natives of the Philippines or corporations 61% of whose stocks are owned by natives or Americans may buy or lease agricultural public lands. A native may buy 100 hectares and lease 1,024 hectares. Corporations can both buy or lease 1,024 hectares. Not long ago, I remember there was a movement to liberalize this law so as to invite foreign capital to come in. It was then that the halls of the Legislature rang with the famous debates of the statesmen finally making it a day for the conservatives. I believed then, and I still believe now that, that was a day of triumph, not only for the defenders of the law, but also for our people and our posterity. But even then, let us be frank with ourselves now and be courageous enough to admit that there is still much to be desired with our present law. To cite just one instance, there are provisos in Act No. 2874 allowing citizens of countries the laws of which grant citizens of the Philippine Islands the same rights to acquire and lease public lands, also the right of leasing or buying public lands in the Philippines. A clever nation for example, whose every nook of her territory, whose every inch of her public land is already occupied or has already been given away to her people might extend to our citizens this tempting privilege of acquiring public land or domain therein just to take advantage of the reciprocity granted in these provisos. And then why shall we want, why shall we expect to acquire lands in other countries when right before us, in this very country of our birth, are millions of hectares of virgin soil merely awaiting the pioneering spirit of our race.


Even without these useless provisos, we have seen how crafty foreigners have cunningly eluded the penal provisions of our laws and despoiled us of our choicest regions in the South. Davao is now a veritable Japanese colony. Let us put more teeth to our laws. Let us not only make the nationalization of our lands and natural resources a subject of ordinary legislation but also of constitutional enactment. Let not the soil moistened with the sweat of our brows and drenched with the blood of our martyrs pass away into alien hands. Let not our children be mere tenants and trespassers in their own country. Let us preserve and bequeath to them the land that is rightfully theirs, free from all foreign liens and encumbrances. Let this God's first and greatest gift to the Filipino race be secured for all times for the interest of that race alone and no more. ""It was this interest in the soil of his native land,""said a famous orator, ""which made the love of that country so strong a passion in the breast of the Roman citizen. It was this which made every Roman glory in the name and hold himself forever ready to fight and die for his country."" Let us emulate this inspiring example of the Romans and reserve the Philippines for the Filipinos alone. If they call this selfishness, then let us be selfish, but wise enough to provide for the safety of our lands from foreign interlopers. Let us be selfish, if but for the primitive reason of protecting our citizens and preserving the integrity of our dominion and Commonwealth; let us be selfish, but at least we will have been freed from possible international entanglements which might upset the peace of the Orient and bring woe unto ourselves.


Gentlemen of the Convention: Our forefathers, our heroes and martyrs are peacefully slumbering beneath the verdure of these tropical lands. The ashes of our dead are being guarded in the bosom of our native soil. You and I, all of us gathered here today will sooner or later, need the call of our Fate and deliver our dust back, to this land of our birth. Let it be that this ancestral soil, where rest the bones of our sires, this beautiful land which shall gather again our ashes back to its fold, be ours alone, for our children and our grandchildren to love and preserve, that our remains be not disturbed in their eternal repose by unfamiliar hands and trampled upon by alien feet.


I thank you.


SPEECH BY DELEGATE CINCO


MR. CINCO. Mr. President and Colleagues: In view of the great importance of the matter under consideration before the Assembly, I have asked for the floor and consequently your indulgence for a brief moment. The amendment under discussion is the suppression of the first part of Section 9 of the draft under General Provisions, namely, ""The National Legislature may determine by law the size of private agricultural lands, which individuals, corporations, or associations may hereafter acquire and hold.


I should like to deal as briefly on the subject as there were other speakers who have preceded me. In answer to an observation by a previous speaker in favor of the amendment that, while he believes the second part of said Section 9 is a wise provision, the first part which is now under discussion is not and, therefore, must be suppressed. I should like to say that the first part of Section 9 is a corollary of the second part. In fact, I believe the two sentences of Section 9 should exchange places, that is, the second part as now stands in the draft, should be placed in the first part, but both sentences must stand in the same Section. If we want to authorize the National Assembly to expropriate big parcels of land to be thereafter subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to individuals, it is because we are in principle against big landholdings. So, it is but reasonable that the National Assembly should also be given the authority to determine by law the size of private agricultural lands which persons may hereafter acquire and hold.


It should also be borne in mind that the draft is not obligatory on the National Legislature when it provides that the National Legislature may determine by law, and I invite you to the use of the word ""may"". It means that the National Legislature will use the power we sought to confer upon it when, and only when, the necessity for its exercise will have arisen.


It has been argued here that the proposed provision is unjust and discriminatory against the hard working citizens of the country, who, being such, may acquire a large private agricultural land. To this, I should like to say that it is my wish that our agricultural lands be as much equally distributed in the course of time from today among the citizens of this country as can legitimately be done, for I believe that such distribution of private agricultural lands will render the country and our government a more lasting peace and stability.


I should like also to invite the attention of my colleagues to what is happening in municipalities where big 
haciendas
 exist and in which thousands of tenants work. The owners of these 
haciendas
 practically control the results of any election held on those communities. Whoever candidates are favored by these landlords are inevitably elected through the instrumentality of tenancy. Who is the tenant who will not abide with the dictates of his landlord?


For all that I have stated and those of the speakers who preceded me in support of the draft, I respectfully pray for the rejection of the amendment under consideration. 


I thank you.

EL PRESIDENTE. Tiene la palabra el Delegado por Iloilo.


MANIFESTACIONES DEL SR. MONTINOLA


SR. MONTINOLA. Señor Presidente Sres. Delegados: Al levantarme boy para dirigiros la palabra, quiero hacer constar mi proposito de hacer un estudio mas detenido del Art. 9 que ayer fue aprobado por esta Asamblea. Yo hubiera querido habiar ayer: pero la falta de oportunidad me privo de este privilegio y antes de entrar en materia quiero hacer constar tambien de que yo no soy propietario de grandes latifundios. Desgraciadamente, poseo poca extension de terreno, lo suficiente para cultivarlo y para mantener las necesidades de mi familia. Tambien hago constar que en la Provincia de Iloilo no hay grandes latifundios. La Provincia de Iloilo es una de las provincias en que la propiedad esta muy dividida. Alli las propiedades no estan acumuladas en manos de unas cuantos personas, y por este motivo, se ha tradado mucho en desarrollar la industria azuearera en Iloilo. Hechas estas declaraciones, voy a, entrar en materia respecto al objeto de la enmienda presentada ayer pidiendo la eliminacion del Art. 9.


Caballeros, por lo que he oido ayer de los discursos pronunciados por varios oradores y particularmente de las intlerpelaciones hechas a los oradores, he llegado a la conclusion de que aqui existe un temor grande con respecto a la acumulacion de las propiedades agricolas en manos de unas cuantas personas.


SR. ESCAREAL. Señor Presidente, para una cuestion de orden. El Delegado por Iloilo esta en el uso del privilegio de la media hora?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor, estoy en al uso del priviegio de la media hora.


SR. ESCAREAL. No se ha pedido el consentimiento unanime de la Convencion. 


VARIOS DELEGADOS. Que siga, que siga.


SR. ORENSE Caballeros, vamos a tener el gusto de oirle a nuestro Vice Presidente.


SR. ESCAREAL. Esta fuera de orden el Delegado por Batangas.


EL PRESIDENTE. Puede proseguir el Delegado por Iloilo.


SR. MONTINOLA. (
Prosiguiendo
.) Caballeros, agradezco vuestra benevolencia al reconocerme para hacer uso de la palabra. Entrando ahora en materia, existe un gran temor, como ya he dicho, de parte le muchos, el que las propiedades esten acumuladas en manos de unas cuantos Personas como las hay ahora, y esta es la creencia que he sacado ayer de las interpelaciones y de log discursos, que muchos creen de que aqui en adelante esas acumulaciones se han de verificar en manos de unas cuantos personas o unas cuantos corporaciones. Se han citado esos grandes latifundios que hay en Nueva Ecija, y se mencionaron esos grandes latifundios que existen en Bataan; pero, Caballeros ros, puedo deciros que esos grandes latifundios no se han formado solamente ahora; esos grandes latifundios de Nueva Ecija se han formado un siglo y medio antes; esos grandes latifundios en Batangas se han formado un siglo antes; esos grandes latifundios de los Tuazon, en Marikina, se ban formado siglos atris, al igual que esos grandes latifundios de los Frailes y es que en aquellos tiempos era facil conseguir grandes latifundios. El que tema influencia en el Gobierno espanol pedia la concesion de largas extensiones mediante una declaracion posesoria instituida ante un juez de paz y por la declaracion de tres testigos de que el solicitante y sus antecesores Ilevaban poseyendo hacia afios esos terrenos. Se pedia la declaracion posesoria como un titulo de su posesion que despues servia titulo para conseguir el titulo real, y por eso era facil conseguir esos grandes latifundios en aquellos tiempos. En Nueva Ecija, cuando se consiguio ese gran latifundio de la familia Gonzales, no habia poblacion todavia alli. Todo era terrenos publicos,que el Gobierno — segun me han informado — por un Real Decreto, consiguio para el progenitor de los Gonzalez un siglo y medio antes de ahora. Entonces todo era bosque, no habia poblacion, no habia pueblo formado. Ahora parte de esos terrenos estan ocupados por ciertos pueblos que se han formado posteriormente, y esa es la razon de la acumulacion de esas propiedades en manos de ciertas y determinadas personas. Hoy ese peligro ha desaparecido. Por la Ley de Terrenos Publicos, ya no se pueden acaparar grandes extensiones de terrenos publicos, ya es imposible que se acumulen grandes propiedades en manos de ciertas y determinadas personas. De aqui en adelante, no hay comerciante, no hay extranjero que invierta dinero y mas dinero en la adquisicion de propiedades agricolas. Actualmente, si algunas propiedades agricolas estan en manos de ciertas personas que poseen ahora miles de hectareas, eso se debe al trabajo de sus qprogenitores que acumularon esas riquezas en manos de su familia. Pero esta no es razon para que nosotros confisquemos ese derecho adquirido de parte de esas personas que han vertido su sudor, que han sacrificado sus vidas y puesto su trabajo para conseguir y acumular esa pequena riqueza que tienen en sus manos ahora.


Caballeros, este precepto limitado la propiedad que puede conseguir un indiniduo o una corporacion, de aqui en adelante, practicamente matara toda iniciativa de parte del individuo, porque una persona que quiera hoy extender sus actividades agricolas para alguna clase de productos, si a la Legislatura se le ocurre friar una extension limitado de 300 a 400 hectares, esa iniciativa tendra que morir, porque es imposible explotar una industria agricola, a base comercial, con poca extension de terreno.


Alguien me dijo anoche que para obviar ese inconvemente, se pueden arrendar terrenos de propietarios colindantes. Yo os digo, al menos basado en mi experiencia alli en las provincias visayas, no se aqui en Luzon, que eso es utopico, porque los propietarios no suelen arrendar sus terrenos mis que por cierto numero de afios, por siete u ocho anos. Y quienn es el que va a invertir dinero en una industria agricola arrendando terrenos por siete u ocho anos? Es imposible completamente, asi es que si un individuo quiere dedicarse a la explotacion de una nueva industria agricola en el pais, como por ejemplo el algodon el 
balatong
 o soybin que Manchuria estan importando 200,000,000 de 
dollars
 en America, y aqui en Filipinas ese producto de puede muy bien cultivar, quien, repito, va a invertir dinero para cultivar este products a base comercial, si no poseyera propiedades que le dieran seguridad de que por algunos anos podria seguir disfrutando, gozando o utilizando sus propiedades agricolas para la explotacion de su negocio?


Caballeros, por otra parte hay el inconveniente que anoche se formule por ciertos Caballeros, y que por cierto no fue contestado satisfactoriamente por ciertos oradores, y es el que se refiere a la herencia. Si un padre de familia que posee 4,000 hectares, y que no tiene mas que un hijo o dos, si despues la Legislatura fijase la extension de terreno que puede adquirir un individuo en 500 hectareas, ese heredero no podria adquirir mas de 500 hectareas. Y que se hara del resto?


SR. CUADERNO. Para la informacion del orador quiero decirle que estoy dispuesto a contestar ese punto en cualquier memento.


SR. MONTINOLA. (
Prosiguiendo
.) Ahora me dirin que se expropiar esas propiedades, que el Gobierno estari dispuesto a expropiar todo el exceso que podrian recibir los herederos de sus padres. Ahora, pregunto, estari dispuesto el Gobierno a expropiar todas esas propiedades que no puedan ser recibidas por cualquier individuo o corporacion, por la prohibicion de la ley? Yo no creo que el Gobierno este dispuesto a invertir dinero en esas propiedades para despues repartirlas a precio de costo a los individuos, porque hay propiedades en donde no hay poblacion, no hay casas, no hay residentes en esas haciendas, lo mismo en Luzon que en Visayas, y a quien va a vendey el gobierno esas propiedades? A personas extranas? La venta que hari el gobierno entiendo se hart mas bien a las personas que ya radican en los mismos sitios, porque si no radican en el mismo sitio, si no tienen casa alli,no creo que compren.


SR. VILLANUEVA (H.). Sr. Presidente, para una aclaracion.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. VILLANUEVA (H.). No es verdad que el Art. 9 solamente autoriza a la Asamblea Nacional para hacer uso de las facultades que nosotros confiamos a ella?


SR. MONTINOLA. Es verdad.


SR. VILLANUEVA (H.). Entonces que temor hay?


SR. MONTINOLA. Porque no si fija laextension, ese es el temor precisamente. 


SR. VILLANUEVA (H.). Para otra aclaracion.


SR. MONTINOLA. Prefiero que me deje continuer, porque lo que S.S. hace no son aclaraciones, son interpelaciones.


(
Prosiguiendo
.) Por eso, Caballeros, hay el caso ese, hay el peligro realmente de que sino se fija la extension, la Legislatura tiene que actuar en cada caso particular.


SR. ORENSE. Sr. Presidente, para algunas preguntas tendentes a ese punto.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si es para ayudar, estoy dispuesto a contestar.


SR. ORENSE. Para ayudar. S.S. como Senador debe estar bien informado de que nuestro gobierno por haberse embarcando en la compra de las haciendas de los frailes para revenderlos en lotes a los terratenientes hasta ahora tiene ereditos por valor de millones de pesos contra es os terratenientes, porque no han podido pagar hasta ahora los. lotes que han comprado.


SR. MONTINOLA. Es cierto.


SR. ORENSE. Por eso digo yo, si hay la mar de terrenos comprados por el gobierno que no estan todavia revendidos a los particulares y que los terrenos que se han vendido todavia no estan pagados, no cree S.S. que el gobierno de hoy en adelante no debe comprar ya terrenos por exceso de ello?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si, señor.


SR. ORENSE. No es verdad que los bonos emitidos por el gobierno para invertir en la compra de esos terrenos, hasta ahora no estan redimidos?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. KAPUNAN. Sr. Presidente, para algunas preguntas al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si es para ayudar, si señor.


SR. KAPUNAN. S.S. esta enterado de los millones y millones de hectareas de terrenos que todavia estan sin explotar y que necesitan la iniciativa particular para su desarrollo?


SR. MONTINOLA. Es verdad.


SR. KAPUNAN. Puede informarme S.S. cuantos millones de hectareas de terreno, que todavia no estan explotadas?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si mal no recuerdo, parece que hay unos doce millones.


SR. KAPUNAN. Y que necesitan de la iniciativa del gobierno y de los particulares?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. KAPUNAN. Y que por consiguiente seria matar la iniciativa, seria impedir que se desarrollen esos terrenos?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


(
Prosiguiendo
.) De manera que si hay se ese impedimento para conseguir los terrenos publicos, el impedimenta que prescribe el Articulo 9 de nuestra 
draft
, es mayor todavia, por que ni siquiera se permite de una manera taxativa y clara que un particular pueda conseguir tal extension de terreno, sino que se deja completamente a la Legislatura.


SR. NIERE. Sr. Presidente para una pregunta al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor, si es para ayudar.


SR.NIERE. Es para ayudarle. Bajo el precepto constitucional que hemos aprobado anoche, no se ha fijado el numero de hectareas, sino que la Legislature es quien debe legislar, no es verdad?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. NIERE. De modo que S.S. parte del supuesto de que la Asamblea Nacional no ha de actuar sobre una legislacion de conformidad con los intereses del pueblo, no es verdad?


SR. MONTINOLA. Ego no es para ayudar.


SR. MONTAÑO Sr. Presidente, para una pregunta al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. MONTAÑO. No es verdad que la disposicion del draft puede constituir un desaliendo para el desarrollo de la industria del pueblo filipino?


SR. MONTINOLA. Ya he dicho que eso mata la iniciativa de las personas. Es acaso logico que en este 
draft
 se dijera que cada individuo no ha de tener mas que cincuenta mil pesos de propiedad? Porque si se limita el traspaso de la propiedad en cierto numero de hectareas, equivale a limitar la riqueza que puede tener cada individuo. Si a un individuo se le limita que no puede tener mas que treacientas hectareas de terreno, quiere decir que su riqueza esta limitada a eso y no puede expansionar ni puede desarrollar sus actividades, porque se le ha limitado sus medios de desarrollo. Esa es la consecuencia logica que ha de venir en este caso.


SR. RAMOS. Sy. Presidente, para una pregunta al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. RAMOS. Con este precepto no es verdad que fomentariamos la indolencia por aquello de que seria mas comodo esperar ya que se repartan las propiedades privadas o particulares, que por lo regular estan cultivadas?


SR. MONTINOLA. Ciertamente.


SR. RAFOLS. Sr. Presidente, para algunas preguntas al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contesta, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. RAFOLS. La primera parte del Art. 9 mata los deseos de cada individuo de poder mejorar su situacion. No es verdad que no exist e la necesidad de aprobarla esta primera parte, puesto que si hay temor de que puedan obtener grandes extensiones de terreno, la segunda parte la puede remediar en el sentido de que el gobierno puede despues expropiar estos terrenos y venderlos despues a los particulares en pedazos pequeños.


SR. MONTINOLA. Pero es que estamos ahora tratando de la primera parte.


SR. RAFOLS. Por eso digo, si dejamos de aprobar la primera parte del Art. 9, se podra evitar la adquisicion de grandes extensiones de propiedades ocupadas por muchas personas mediante la expropiacion por el gobierno subdividiendolos en parcelas pequeñas, porque la primera parte dice que la Legislatura Nacionalpodra determinar por ley la extension de terreno agricola privado que en adelante podra adquirir cualquier individuo, corporacion o asociacion y podra autorizar la expropiacion de terrenos y disponer la subdivision de los mismos en pequnos lotes para traspasarlos a los particulares a precio de cosro, de tal manera que si uno ha heredado de sus padre s cincuenta mil hectareas de terreno, el gobierno puede expropiarlos y dividirlos entre los terratenientes.


SR. YSIP. Sr. Presidente, para una cuestion, de orden Parece que el Delegado por Iloilo ya ha expuesto todas sus ideas sobre el particular y pido ...


SR. MONTINOLA. Voy a terminar Caballeros. Este precepto quiza inadvertidamente, por su aprobacion, habeis dado un 
issue
 a los comunistas, porque con este 
draft
 en la mano un candidate comunista puede presentarse al electorado y decir: Caballeros aqui estoy, elegidme como representante, porque cuando yo sea representante dictaremos una ley limitado las propiedadesa encuenta hectareas y lo demas lo Venderemos a un peso por hectarea a vosotros. Esto no semi cierto para una conciencia honrada porque el precio de costo no es un peso por hectareas pero cuando se dice esto ante el electorado en la algidez de las campañas, quien no va a creer lo que dice el candidato sobre el particular? Este es el Peligro. Vosotros sols jovenes y yo ya soy viejo y no vere la aurora de la libertad; pero vosotros que sois jovenes todavia podeis ver que cada ano que pase ese numero de comunistas aumentara y quizas por ese 
issue
 conseguiran domina el Estado.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO (Sr. Cuenco). Ha terminado el tiempo del orador. 


SR. KAPUNAN. Sr. Presidente, pido el consentimiento unanime de la Asamblea para acceder la reconsideracion del Art. 4.


SR. CUADERNO. Me opongo.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO (Sr. Cuenco). Habiendo objecion presentada por el Caballero por Bataan, Sr. Cuaderno, no puede accederse a la peticion del Caballero por Leyte. Ademas, habiendo pasado mas de veinticuatro horas desde que se aprobo el precepto cue se trata de reconsiderar, la Mesa declara fuera de orden la mocion. Ademis, el asunto ha sido ya reconsideracion y la peticion ha sido desestimada. Los reglamentos prohiben que se reconsidere un asunto por dos veces.


SR. KAPUNAN. Parece que estamos en los ultimos dias de la Asamblea y tenemos derecho a pedir la suspension de los reglamentos.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. La Mesa desea saber si hay dos terceras partes que apoye la mocion del Caballero por Leyte. Los que esten conformes con la mocion del Caballero por Leyte, tengan la bonded de levantarse. (
Se levantas algunos Delegados
.) No habiendo dos terceras partes, se desestima la mocion.


SR. ORENSE. Sr. Presidente, para una mocion con respects al Art. 9. Voy a cambiar mi voto.


VARIOS DELEGADOS. No, no.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. La Mesa declara que no puede hacerse esa proposicion y esta fuera de orden. Habiendose anunciado el resultado de la votacion, ningun voto puede cambiarse.


SR. ORENSE. Para fines de reconsideracion solamente. Tenemos precedentes aqui y yo invoco esos precedentes para cambiar mi voto.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. La Mesa ya ha declarado fuera de orden esa peticion.


SR. MONTINOLA. Pido la reconsideracion del Art. 9.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El caballero por Iloilo vote en contra de la supresion y por ese motivo no puede pedir la reconsideracion.


SR. LOPEZ. Sr. Presidente, ayer vote a favor de la supresion y consta eso en el 
record
 y pido ahora la reconsideracion de la primero parte del Art. 9.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Esta en orden la mocion presentada por el Delegado por Batangas, Sr. Lopez. Tiene la palabra el Caballero por Batangas, Sr. Orense.


SR. ORENSE. Sr. Presidente y Caballeros de la Convencion: Yo no vengo francamente preparado para pro-nunciar un discurso elocuente como los que han pronunciado los defensores del 
draft
. Pero despues de haber oido al Caballero por Iloilo, demostrando aqui que esa primera parte del Art. 9 debe suprimirse,me he atrevido a aceptar la donacion de la palabra que me ha hecho mi colega. Caballeros, lo que se trata o el verdadero proposito o como diriamos ahora hablando constitucion almente, la filosofia de la primera parte del Art. 9 consiste en evitar la existencia de grandes latifundios en nuestro pais y evitar de este modo la concentracion de grandes propiedades en manos de unos cuantos. Quiero decirles ahora que este temor a peligro es infundado. No existen actualmente grandes latifundios en manos de unas cuantos personas en nuestro pais. Los grandes latifundios existen en manos del estado porque tenemos muchos terrenos publicos. Pero terrenos privados son unas cuantos haciendas que no pasaran de 3 o 4 en manos de unos cuantos. Con respecto a algunas propiedades yo se positivamente que ya se ha acordado la venta en parcelas. Los han subdividido pero es el caso que nuestros paisanos no tienen dinero para ir pagando esos lotes y comprarlos. La mejor prueba, senores, es que he sido por seis meses copropietario de una gran hacienda alrededor de Manila, de San Juan del Monte. Voy a decirles ahora el caso. He tenido que vender, Caballeros esta hacienda, y cuando yo trataba de venderla he procurado encontrar capital filipino, porque mi deseo era traspasarlo a manos filipinas pero cual fue mi desengano cuando no puede encontrar capital filipino sino capital americano y son esos que venden ahora la San Juan Heights y que estan ganando bastante dinero.


Tenemos otra hacienda grande, la hacienda de Mandaluyong 
Estate
 que se ha vendido a un filipino y a un americano. Esa hacienda que tiene ocho mil hectareas, esta ahora subdividida y requetesubdividida. La Hacienda de San Pedro Makati al rededor de Manila, la misma esta dividida y subdividida. Que hacienda, pues, queda por venderse? 


SR. CONFESOR. Para una pregunta al orador.


SR. ORENSE. Yo quisiera que me dejen primera en paz, y ya le contestare despues.


Entre los casos pricticos que aqui se han planteado y ha vuelto el orador por Iloilo a mencionar de un propietario, esta el de un propietario de una extension grande de terreno agricola, en el caso de que la Legislatura acordara o limitara una extension menor y no tuviera mas que uno o dos hijos a quienes dejar, como quedaria el exceso? Se ha sugerido que el gobierno podria expropiar para luego revenderlo. Caballeros, si este es el proposito de ir embarcando a nuestro gobierno en la empress de compra de propiedades privadas para luego revenderlas en lotes pequenos, va a Ilegar el dia en que este gobierno iria necesariamente a la bancarrota, sobre todo durante el ano o el periods de la mancomunidad y durante nuestra independencia en que con seguridad nuestros recursos economicos por lo mismo que somos un pueblo naciente, tienen que decrecer, de donde saldra tanto dinero para pagar nuestras propiedades? De donde saldra? dirian que el gobierno emitira bonos, pero un pueblo naciente no tan facilmente encontrara mercado para colocar sus bonos y yo no quisiera que este gobierno que tenemos, que tiene, un credito puede decirse internacional ahora, Ilegue a perder ese credito y a convertirseen un gobierno de 
balasubas
, porque eso seria la situacion. Si no hay dinero para afrontar las obligaciones, que pasara a ese gobierno o a un particular, que por ambicioso y por querer gastar mas de lo que tiene, no puede pagar sus compromisos? Eso seria exactamente la situacion. Quiero referirme a la compra que hizo el gobierno en los primeros alios de occupacion americana de todas las haciendas de las corporaciones religiosas. El gobierno para hacerse cargo de esta empresa ha tenido que emitir bonos por muchos millones bonos al tres y medio y al cuatro por ciento. Creo que estos bonos hasta ahora no estan totalmente redimidos y los terrenos estan ya vendidos todos pero no han pagade todos los que han comprado. Me consta, por propio conocimiento personal y no por referencias, porque algunas deudores de Calamba que no han podido hasta ahora pagar al gobierno sus deudas ni tampoco a nosotros que hemos tenido que aceptar, aunque siquiera una hipoteca menos eficaz porque no hay Titulo Torrens hasta ahora, por no haber podido pagar al gobierno el importante de sus terrenos. Senores: que quiere decir esta? El dia de mañana si tenemos que embarcar al gobierno, este se va a encontrar con que no tan facilmente podria reintegrarse del dinero invertido. Han pasado treinta y tantos afios desde que el gobierno ha revendido esas propiedades, y sin embargo, ha sido acaso reintegrado el gobierno, del dinero que invirtio hasta ahora? No, antes al contrario; el gobierno esta pagando intereses sobre los bonos aun no redimidos. Ademas, existe el siguiente peligro todavia; y yo me baso en hechos consumados: en esta venta de los terrenos de las haciendas de los frailes en que he intervenido como uno de los abogados del gobierno he notado que el pobre aparcero con cuyo sudor ha desmontado los bosques y los ha convertido en terrenos provechosos, no es el que ha solido beneficiado: es el cacique que el pueblo que por tener dinero es el primero que ha podido comprar. Pues otro tanto va a ocurrir si el dia de mañana la Legislatura decretara que las mil, dos mil o cuatro mil hectareas o lo que pase de 500 hectareas se vendan en lotes pequeños y si no tienen dinero para anticipar a ese gobierno, seria lo mismo que sera unos cuantos los que saldrian beneficiados y el cabapesino que gasta pantalones cortos y sombrero de 
salakot
 con carabao y arado, ese no sera beneficiado. Seguira siendo explotado por el cacique del pueblo. Hemos venido aqui no solamente para defender los intereses de los grandes sino tambien los de los pequenos, y por lo tanto debemos tratarles con igualdad como hemos enunciado y consignado en el 
bill of rights
. Igualdad ante la ley, igualdad entre pobres y ricos entre poderosos y debiles. 


Caballeros: os ruego que reconsideremos y no demos este paso, porque podria Ilegar el dia en que esta Asamblea, como dijo muy bien el caballero por Iloilo, cuando deje de existir y se erija a nuestros representantes a la Asamblea Constituyente y estos vayan a ocupar asiento alli, hubiere una mayoria que se defienda ante el electorado diciendo que se van a repartir las tierras que excedan del numero limitado. Caballeros, la palabra ""repartir"" es muy sugestiva y por eso, yo quisiera que meditemos y reconsideremos el Articulo 9 en su primera parte.


Estoy ahora dispuesto a contestar preguntas de los companeros.


EL PRESIDENTE. El tiempo de Su Senoria ha expirado, y el Delegado por Cebu, Sr. Sotto (F.) tiene la palabra.


SR. SOTTO (F.). Señor Presidente: Que hay, caballeros de la Convencion en el fondo de esta cuestion al parcer inocente y ordinaria para que tanto revuelo haya metido, tanto en la sesion de ayer como en la de hoy? Qui hay de misterioso en el fondo de este problema, para que politicos del volumen del caballero por Iloilo y del caballero por Batangas tomen con gran interes una mocion para reconsiderar lo acordado ayer? Voy a ser frio, senores. Parece que estas cuestiones es mejor tratarlas con calma y no con apasionamiento. He prestado atencion como siempre suelo hacer a todos los argumentos aducidos aqui en contra del precepto contenido en el 
draft
 y a favor ahora de la reconsideracion y siento decir lo siguiente: todos son argumentos muy buenos a
 posteriori
. Cuando la Asamblea Nacional se haya reunido, sera la ocasion de ver si o no procede expropiar terrenos o latifundios existentes ahora o existentes despues. En el presents yo me limito a invitar la atencion de la Convencion al hecho de que el precepto no hace otra cosa mis que autorizar a la Asamblea Nacional a que tome las medidas necesarias en tiempo oportuno cuando el problema del latifundismo se haya presentado con caracteres tales que el bienestar, interes y orden publicos lo requieran. Permitame la Convencion que le discuta en globo las dos partes del Articulo 9; hay tal engranaje en log dos mandatos que tiene dicho precepto, hay tal eslabon en una u otra parte que es imposible, que es diffcil que quitaramos deslindes si nos limitasemos a considerar una sola parte. La. primera parte autoriza a la Legislatura para fijar el limite maximo de propiedad agricola que los ciudadanos particulares puedan tener. Parece que es un punto que ha pasado desapercebido. No se trata aqui ahora de propiedades urbanas, sino de propiedades agricolas, y es por la razon de que con mucha especialidad es en las regiones agricolas, en las zonas rusticas es donde el latifundismo se extiende con facilidad, y desde alli los tentilculos de los caciques van al cuello de los pobres y de los pequenos propietarios precisamente para ahogarles y para inutiliazarles. Esta, pues, a salvo completamente la cuestion de las propiedades urbanas. Ciertos grandes solares de nuestras ciudades, su pretexts de tener ciertos edificios, que en realidad no necesitan de tales extensos solares para su existencia ni para su mantenimiento pueden dormir tranquilos. No vamos contra esas propiedades. Por una causa o por otra el pasado nos ha legado ese lastre doloroso. Pero la region agricola, la region menos explotada por nuestro pueblo, la region que necesitamos si queremos vivir por cuenta propia, la region que es el mayor incentive no solo para los grandes capitalistas de fuera sino tambien para los grandes capitalistas interiores, esa region merece todos los ciudados del gobierno.


Voy a pasar ahora a la relacion que tiene la segunda parte de la enmienda con la primera. Una vez demostrado ante la Legislatura, una vez convencida la Asamblea a National de que existe un latifundismo y que este latifundismo puede producir males o esta produciendo danos a la comunidad, es cuando entonces la Legislatura puede acordar la expropiacion de los latifundios. Donde esta el mal que los opositores a este precepto pretenden ver inutilmente? Prever es gobernar. Este es un postalado que todos lo conocen. Bien. Voy a admitir para los propositos del argumento que hoy no existen latifundios, y si los opositores al precepto quieren mas, vamos a convenir que no existiran en el futuro. Pues, entonoes, donde esta el temor que el hijo de tal no puede recibir la herencia de cual? El ejemplo repetidas veces presentado ayer y hoy en cuanto al heredero y al causante no es completamente exacto. Vamos a suponer que efectivamente un padre de familia posee un numero tal de hectareas de terreno, superior o excedente a lo que fija la ley. Creen los caballeros, creen los opositores al precepto que la Legislature, la Asamblea Nacional va a ser tan imprudente, tan loca que inmediatamente disponga por ley que aquella porcion excedente del terreno que ha de recibir un hijo de su padre no podra poseerlo no podra tenerlo o recibireo el heredero?


Esa es una materia para la Asamblea Nacional. La Asamblea Nacional sabe que no puede dictar leyes o medidas imposibles de cumplir. Fijari el plazo, fijari la proposicion de acuerdo con las circunstancias del tiempo entonces en que vivamos. Es posible que ahora un numero determinado de hectareas sea excesivo es posible que por desenvolvimiento economicos del pais ese numero de hectareas pueda ser elevado o reducido. Es por esto, el porque, el Comite precisamente no ha querido fijar desde ahora el numero de hectareas, prefiriendo dejar a la sabiduria, a la prudencia, al patriotismo y a la justicia de la Asamblea Nacional el friar ese numero.


Lo mismo digo de la expropiacion. Se habla de que el gobierno no tendra dinero; se habla de que no podra revender las propiedades. Pero, caballeros de la Convencion, caballeros opositores al precepto: si la Legislatura, si la Asamblea Nacional estuviera convencida de que el gobierno no puede hacer una expropiacion, va a hacerlo? La Asamblea Nacional dictara una ley autorizando la expropiacion de tal o cual latifundio cuando esto convencida, primero, de que la existencia de ese latifundio es amenazante para el bienestar publico: y, segundo, cuando la Asamblea Nacional este convencida de que el gobierno esta en disposicion para disponer la expropiacion.


Visto, puesto, desde este punto el asunto, no es malo autorizar fijar los limites, ni muchos menos es malo autorizar a la Legislatura para dictor leyes de expropiacion.


Pero voy a molestares por un minuto mas. Se ha mentado aqui con algun exito esta mañana — y digo con exito porque he oido algunos aplayos — se ha mentado la posibilidad de que los comunistas hagan un 
issue
 de esta disposicion que existe en el 
draft
; podran los comunistas pedir los votos del electorado para ser ellos los que dicten las leyes fijando el limite del terreno y ordenen la expropiacion. Que argumento mas bonito si tuviera base? Lo mas natural, creo yo, es que el pueblo, el electorado, al ver que es una Asamblea Constituyente comunista la que ha puesto esta disposicion, otorgue sus votos a esta misma Asamblea Nacional o a esos candidatos no comunistas. Quien esta en disposicion de terminar mejor una obra, aquel que ha trazado y puesto los Primeros pilares, o aquel que viene de gorra al final de la obra para decir; ""Aqui estoy para poner el tejado""?


Es sensible, sin embalgo, que una cuestion de importancia tan nacional como esta, pretendamos ligarla a los votos de los comunistas. El comunismo no ha de venir, porque nosotros fijimos los limites de terreno; no ha de venir porque prohibamos los latifundios mediante expropiacion forzosa, no; ha de venir precisamente por causa de los grandes propietarios de terreno, y ha de venir, queramoslo o no, porque el mundo esta evolucionando y se va a convencer de que la vida no es solamente para unos cuantos sino para todos, porque Dios nos la dio, la libertad, el aire, la luz, la tierra para vivir (
Grandes aplausos
), y por algo se ha dicho que en los comienzos de la vida humana debio haber sido fusilado, matado, a aquel primera que puso un cerco a un pedazo de tierra reclamando ser suya la propiedad. .Por estas razones, senor Presidente, y sintiendo que mi tiempo esta para terminar, voy a dar fin a mi discurso agradeciendo a la Convencion.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Ha expirado el tiempo del orador.


MR. LOPEZ (E.). Mr. President.


The PRESIDENT. The gentleman from Negros Oriental has the floor.


MR. LOPEZ (E.). Mr. President, and gentlemen of the Convention. Last night when this question was put to a vote, I voted in favor of retaining the provisions of the draft. I am a socialist, but I am not a socialist of the Maxwell Type. I believe in individualism, gentlemen of the Convention. I was very much impressed by the last part of the Speech of Delegate Montinola. Japan and China and many other countries today are spending millions of pesos and sacrificing thousands of lives to preserve the institution of individualism which has developed and made the world the great world that it is today. The great American continent was developed through the initiative of the great American individualists who made the great country that it is today. I very much fear that by the insertion to the Constitution of this precept, we might kill that individual initiative which has made our progress. Gentlemen of the Convention, there is enough land in the Philippines today for every Filipino citizen in this country and for every Filipino citizen for the next two generations to come. There is no fear in my mind that a great free landholdings in the Philippines will endanger the social structure that we are trying to build in this country. We can learn lessons from the experiences of the great American nation. In the beginning of the history of America, the Americans were individualists — great individualists; but modern progress brought out the American nation changing its form of government and introducing the means which kill the ambition of the individualists. They have developed the theory and principle of the great police power of the State. Judicial statemanship has developed the power to an extent that now the state — the central government in the United States is practically so great that no individual or group of individuals can challenge that power of the ment to promote the welfare, the progress and the prosperity of the whole nation. Through the development of the principle of police power of the state, it is now the established doctrine in the United States that private property is held in trust for the benefit of the community. They have done that without any amendment of the Constitution. They have tried to bend the rigid principles of that Constitution to accomodate its provisions to the needs of the times. No laws, no amendment to that Constitution has been done. It was done because the American people not only in individualism; the great American nation also believe that the government must have the power and right to promote the progress, the prosperity and the happiness of the American people. Gentlemen of the Convention, there is one thing we must consider. If we approve this provision in the draft I very much fear that this country would not be able to enter into the open competition with the other neighboring countries in the open markets of the world. There is a reason for giving the individual full play in the management of the property There is reason for giving the individual full play in the development of his powers. We are not going to pull that down. We should follow that in order that the individuals would have to promote their lives. The principle that we should follow is for the great to pull up the less energetic and make this nation really energetic that we should be. Gentlemen of the Convention, we are laying down the foundation for the future. We need all our patience, all of our intelligence, all of our statesmanship in the task. We should not be radicals. We should, and I think we must, give full play to the development of individualism in this country, and therefore I favor, and I hope that you also favor the reconsideration of this question.


THE PRESIDENT. The time of the gentleman has expired.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El tiempo del orador ha expirado. Ahora tiene la palabra el Delegado por Negros Occidental, Sr. Locsin.


SR. ROXAS. Señor Presidente: Antes de comezar en el uso de la palabra el Delegado por Negros Occidental, quisiera dirigirle una pregunta, y creo que el caballero por Negros Occidental gustosamente accede a mi peticion.


Bajo esta disposicion quedaran afectados los propietarios que hoy poseen grandes extensiones de terreno, es decir, es la interpretacion del Comite de que la Legislatura no podra limitar las propiedades de modo que afecten a los actuates poseedores?


SR. LOCSIN. Contestare al caballero por Capiz diciendo que hay esta disposicion o esta frase: 
May hereafter
.


SR. ROXAS. De modo que estas palabras 
may hereafter
 es para proteges derechos adquiridos? Creo que no es muy clara la disposicion, pero el Comite de Estilo puede aclararla mas tarde.


SR. BRIONES. Señor Presidente: En este punto de la cuestion, como se recordara, yo suscite algunas dudas sobre la interpretacion de este precepto en la sesion de anoche; las mismas dudas que ha suscitado aqui, el Delegado, por Capiz. Con la explicacion dada aqui por el Presidente del Comite de Recursos Naturales, que fue el que esbozo este precepto, yo me doy por enteramente satisfecho, y me alegro que esas dudas hayan sido disipadas satisfactoriamente, y quisiera pedir al Delegado por Negros Occidental que me reserve unos cuantos minutos de su tiempo para hablar en contra de la mocion de reconsideracion.


DISCURSO DEL SR. LOCSIN


SR. LOCSIN. Señor Presidente y Caballeros de la Convencion: Estaba procurandome una representacion grafica de la filosofia del articulo hoy en discussion. Creo haberla hallado. El delegado por Batangas Sr. Orense, que lo impugna, es de una corpulencia notable, que su baja estatura mas lo abulta. Este vuestro servidor, tiene pocas carnes y es bien alto. Una reservada facultad, para crear de entre los dos Sr. Orense, el tipa medio, de la ponderacion estetica del fisico de nuestro Presidente, Sr. Recto, es sencillamente un logro. El ejercito de esa facultad, sera para buscar el equilibrio entre todos los detalles, que exaltaria la belleza armonica del conjunto. Pues bien, esa es la naturaleza de la facultad que se confiere a la Asamblea Nacional en virtud de este articulo. Es un atributo mas de soberania, para que en un determinado momento, puede el gobierno marcar su utilidad directriz y reguladora de la sociedad.


Nuestro Vice Presidente, el delegado Sr. Montinola, senalo que este articulo, facilitaria la implantacion del decomunismo en el pais. Si no ando equivocado, la negacion de la propiedad privada, es un principio basico del comunismo. La facultad del Estado de regular la propiedad privado, pre-establece el reconocimiento de la mismo de la propiedad privada. El articulo presidente al que hoy estamos considerando, establece terminantemente la propiedad privada. Por lo tanto, definitivamente, por el tiempo en que esta Constitution que estamos redactando, sea la Magna Carta del pais, el comunismo queda descartado.


El delegado Sr. Lopez, por Batangas, ha ponderado el individualisms. Anotaremos que en la estructuracion contemporanea del gobierno y de la vida americana, el individuo esta cediendo su puesto a la organizacion. Cuanto mas compleja es la vida y mas grande y nutrido es el bazar de hombres y de cosas la interdependencia se hace mas fuerte y trabazonada. El individuo se hace gobernar, y este, quiere decir simplemente, que renuncia parte de sus prerogatives individuales en interes de las necesidades de una comunidad social ordenada.


El articulo, respeta los derechos adquiridos. La sucesion hereditaria que se encarque de sub-dividir la propiedad grande ya formado. Pero establece la facultad del Estado de regular la propiedad privada por formarse. El objeto principal de este articulo, es para que el Estado pueda vincular a la tierra el mayor numero de propietarios economicamente independientes. La experiencia de muchas naciones, nos revels que la democracia agraria de Jefferson, desarrollada plenamente es una garantia de estabilidad y prosperidad nacionales.


No se Ilegara a drasticas limitaciones de la propiedad privada. Esta tiene que estar al margen de una politica de atomizacion de la propiedad. El cuerpo ya consagrado de nuestra Constitution asi lo garantiza. Hemos estatuido que el Estado podra, de los terrenos agricolas publicos, vender a un individuo hasta 144 hectareas, y a una corporacion 1024 hectareas. Por consecuencia la Asamblea Nacional, cuando quiera friar la extension de la propiedad privada, no podra bajar de estos limites. Sostenemos que esta facultad, no puede matar la iniciativa privada. La agricultura cientifica, ofrece un campo virgen aun, para la acometividad de los agricultores del pais, si quieren duplicar su produccion en una determinada unidad de terreno. La associacion entre propieptarios, la confederacion de sus propiedades, daria lugar a una vasta extension, que debidamente explotada, llenaria la necesidad de las empresas millonarias. Tenemos el ejemplo de las Centrales Azucareras, que sin ser duenas de terrenos, crearon verdaderos distritos de produccion del azucar, mediante la confederacion de propiedades, contiguas unas de otras.


Esos que combaten tanto el intervencionismo gubernamental, hace observar un miembro del Gabinete del Presidente Roosevelt, en momentos de crisis, son los primeros en urgiria. Senalo que los aceiteros de los Estados Unidos hicieron fuertes representaciones cerca del gobierno para que este re encargara de sus negocios. Aqui en Filipinas, cuando surgen conflictos industriales o agrarios la reaccion primera del dueno de la fabrica o del hacendero, es pedir la proteccion armada del gobierno. Si esto es verdad, por que esta resistencia contra una facultad mas para el Estado, que ha de ampliar su utilidad ordenadora de la vida social?


Señor Presidente y Caballeros de la Convencion; somos del pueblo y Estamos en esta del pueblo, para formalizar la solemnidad liturgica de los esponsales de la nacion y la libertad. La mujer que se hace madre, exalta sus nuevas responsabilidades, haciendo un acopio de facultades constructives, para formar hijos sanos, dignos y felices. Si queremos rendir la excelsitud de nuestro amor a la nacion filipina, que se apresta a la nueva vida, rodeemosla de atributos que la capaciten para hacer de todos los filipinos, ciudadanos libres, y contentos de la vida.


Por todas estas consideraciones, yo os pido, que voteis contra la mocion de reconsideracion.


SR. ENRIQUEZ. Sr. Presidente para una pregunta.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Ya ha expirado el tiempo del orador.


SR. ENRIQUEZ. Es una pregunta important que el Presidente del Comite de Nacionalizacion puede contestar. .SR. LOCSIN. Bueno, voy a contestar.


SR. ENRIQUEZ. El Presidente del Comite de Ponencia el Sr. Sotto, a quien yo admiro ha afirmado el otro dia en su discurso aqui que el Art. 9 se refiere a latifundios que puede el gobierno expropiarlos y luego revenderlos a los terratenientes. Pero yo entiendo a S.S. que si bien esa interpretacion es corrects en partly y en parte no, porque la fraseologia del Art. 9 no distingue sobre la clase de latifundios, habla solamente de que el gobierno Puede expropiar terrenos ... .


SR. LOCSIN. En cuanto Ileguemos a la segunda parte y si hay tiempo tendre la satisfaccion de explicar a toda la Asamblea el alcance de este articulo.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Tiene la palabra el Delegado por Cebu, Sr. Briones.


SR. BRIONES. Sr. Presidente, Caballeros de la Convencion: Si ha habido alguna parte de la Constitution sobre la cual ... 


SR. ORENSE Sr. Presidente, para una question de orden. Parece que se han registrado turnos en pro y en contra y creo ... 


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El Delegado por Negros Occidental cedio parte de su tiempo al Delegado por Cebu. El Delegado por Cebu no tiene mas que cinco minutos que es parte del tiempo del Delegado por Negres Occidental.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Puede continuar el Delegado por Cebu.


SR. BRIONES. Si Presidente, como yo decia si hay alguna parte de la Constitution sobre la cual yo haya meditado por mis tiempo y mas seriamente, ese es el precepto que hoy estamos debatiendo, y no era para mencionar, Sr. Presidente, porque parece que esta parte de la Constitucion puede dar la impression, como ya se ha insinuado en algunos sectores de esta Asamblea, de que esta parte de la Constitution viene a atacar el principio fundamental de la propiedad privada. Sr. Presidente, despuss de meditar sobre los alcances, el peso de esta parte del precepto, yo he llegado a la conclusion de que no existe aqui ningun atentado contra la propiedad privada, como se insinuo anoche por el distinguido delegado por Cavite, Sr. Francisco. Se reconoce precismente en este precepto el principio fundamental de la propiedad privida. Todo lo que hacemos es regular la propiedad privada y esto entra perfectamente dentro de los poderes, dentro de las facultades del Estado.


TEEHANKEE, 
J, 
concurrinng and dissenting:


I concur in the result of the main opinion, insofar as it reverses the decision of the lower Court which granted petitioner-appellees petition for a writ of prohibition and permanently enjoined respondents-appellees from instituting the proceedings for the expropriation of the ""Tatalon Estate"" as specifically authorized by Republic Act No. 2616. 


The result is that respondents may now properly file the corresponding expropriation proceedings for the expropriation of the ""Tatalon Estate"". It will be recalled that in 1961, the Court in G.R. No. L-18128 upheld the preliminary injunction issued by the lower Court enjoining the filing of such expropriation proceedings, until decision of the prohibition case on the merits.


From the various views expressed by the members of the Court during the deliberations on the case, I gather that our decision now does not foreclose petitioner from raising in the expropriation proceedings what it may deem as proper and valid objections and defenses to the action, including those it has advanced in the present case, just as respondents may therein adduce additional facts besides, those of record, in support of the petition to be filed by them.


To the extent that the main opinion tends to prematurely judge petitioner's objections and defenses, I reserve my vote. I do not believe that all the relevant facts and circumstances are properly and adequately before the Court to enable it to rule on them now.


For purposes of this separate opinion, it shall suffice to list the principal issues which should properly be resolved, in my estimation, in the expropriation proceedings yet to be instituted.


1.	To begin with, the question of what remains of the ""Tatalon Estate"" that may be subjected to expropriation proceedings has to be threshed out. The Solicitor General speculates in his memorandum (at page 12) that the lower Court's finding of fact that ""only 11.68% of the Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision remained unsold"" is ""deceptive"", because ""the remaining 11.68% could all be inside the Tatalon Estate."" On the other hand, petitioner asserts categorically in its memorandum (at page 9) that ""As a matter of fact, as of February 17, 1969, of the original area of about 109 hectares, 411,968.80 square meters had already been sold. Considering that 50,612.30 square meters are reserved for public parks, 3,724.20 square meters for alleys, and 241,989.50 square meters for streets, only 388,989.50 square meters, or less than 39 hectares, remain unsold.""


2.	Similarly, the question of whether there remain ""
bona fide
"" occupants on the property, who are the express beneficiaries of Republic Act 2616 or whether such occupants are merely illegal squatters and occupants as found by the lower court in its decision and asserted by petitioner is one of sharp conflict.


3.	All these factual questions should first be determined, before the vital issues of necessity of the taking and whether it is for the public use, may be resolved. I do, not think that the re-examination of the Baylosis case can properly be undertaken now without the relevant facts before us. Whatever facts these are, as found by the lower court, appear to be adverse to respondents, but respondents shall have another opportunity at the expropriation proceedings to establish the necessary facts which could bring the questioned Act within confines of constitutional limits.


4.	For the main opinion quotes with favor from Justice Tuason in the leading Guido case that ""no fixed line of demarcation between what taking is for public use and what is not can be made; each case has to be judged according to its peculiar circumstances"" and that, ""the assertion of the right on the part of the legislature to take the property of one citizen and transfer it to another, even for a full compensation, when the public interest is not promoted thereby, is claiming a despotic power, and one inconsistent with every just principle and fundamental maxim of a free government."" I share the view in the dissenting opinion of Justice J.B.L. Reyes that the constitutional provision is not necessarily limited to landed estates. (Article XIII, section 4). But that case clearly involved agrarian discontent and with the pertinent facts yet to be established, I am not prepared to say that it is 
in pari materia
 with the case at bar. We must first have the peculiar facts and circumstances governing the case at bar, before we can judge it.
1


5.	Neither do I agree with the observation that the constitutional power of Congress for the expropriation of lands is well-nigh all embracing and forecloses the courts from inquiring into the necessity for the taking of the property. It is noted that this is the first case where Congress has singled out a particular property for condemnation under the constitutional power conferred upon it. Does this square with the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution? Is the explanatory note of the bill later enacted as Republic Act 2616, without any evidence as to a hearing with the affected parties having been given the opportunity to be heard, and citing merely the population increase of Quezon City and the land-for-the-landless program sufficient compliance with these basic constitutional guarantees? Rather, does not the need for a more serious scrutiny as to the power of Congress to single out a particular piece of property for expropriation, acknowledged in the main opinion, call for judicial scrutiny, with all the facts in, as to the need for the expropriation for full opportunity to dispute the legislative appraisal of the matter? And who should bear the burden of demonstrating that the equal protection guarantee had been observed, the State or the owner whose property has been singled out? 


6.	Pertinent to note with reference to these questions is the guideline in the Guido case that ""the size of the land expropriated, the large number of people benefited, and the extent of social and economic reform secured by the condemnation, clothes the expropriation with public interest and public use"", and the Courts admonition in the subsequent Arellano Law College case that where such limitations and conditions governing the need of taking property for public use are not present, ""the National Government may not confer upon its instrumentalities authority (to expropriate) which it itself may not exercise."" This would indicate precisely that where Congress itself directly exercised the power to expropriate and singles out a specific property under the Act, rather than have the Executive agencies institute the corresponding expropriation proceeding under the general laws it has enacted in pursuance of its constitutional power, the question of its appraisal of the necessity and of the validity of its exercise of the authority to expropriate the specific property is not foreclosed from judicial scrutiny.


7.	Finally, the main opinion acknowledges that existing contractual rights that have been acquired by vendor and purchasers of subdivided lots of the property shall be accorded the appropriate constitutional protection of non-impairment, at the expropriation proceedings. Importantly related to this unassailable dictum are questions not founded on primacy of property rights concepts or personal predilections or private notions of policy. These concern the fact that the Tatalon Estate has been subdivided into lots for sale to the public, with priority after the passage of Republic Act No. 2616 to the occupants (and such purchasers may have been theretofore landless themselves), and the Court's reason in dismissing the action for condemnation in the analogous Urban Estates. Inc. case that ""the people on whose behalf this action has been instituted could acquire the remaining lots by direct purchase from the defendant like those (direct) purchasers.""
2
 In view of the cardinal principle of eminent domain that just compensation of the market value of the land must be paid as well as of the constitutional limitation that the land be conveyed at cost to the individuals concerned, respondents may well consider that the objectives of the Act may be accomplished more expeditiously by a direct purchase of the available unsold lots for resale at cost to the remaining 
bona fide
 occupants in accordance with the Act's provisions or by extending financial assistance to enable them to purchase directly the unsold lots from petitioner. I do not see anything to be gained by respondents from the institution of expropriation proceedings, when petitioner-owner is actually selling the property in subdivided lots.


Reyes, J.B.L. and Castro, JJ., concur.


 


 


 Separate Opinions


BARREDO, 
J., 
concurring:


I concur, and this separate opinion is intended only to clarify two statements in the scholarly main opinion of Mr. Justice Fernando that appear to me to be quite inconsistent with each other. It is said therein that ""it (the language of the constitutional provision herein involved) does not admit of doubt that the congressional power thus conferred is far from limited"", (p. 422
 * 
) and that it has a ""well-nigh all embracing sweep"". (p. 423
 * 
) but at page 431
 *
 it is also said that ""there need be no fear that such constitutional grant of power to expropriate is without limit"". To avoid any mistake regarding my view as to which of these two statements should prevail, I would like to state categorically that I consider the power granted to Congress by the Constitution to ""authorize, upon payment of just compensation, the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to individuals"" to be unlimited by any other provision of said Constitution. Just compensation is in reality a part of the power granted rather than a limitation thereto, just as just compensation is of the essence in any exercise of the power of eminent domain, as otherwise, it would be plain commandeering. Withal, I hold that the power of eminent domain, in general, is an inherent power of any government, as, otherwise, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the government to adequately respond to the demands of public need and interest. What government can exist without the power to expropriate lands for streets, schools, public buildings, wharves and military reservations, to mention only some of the indispensable things that any country worthy of its name must establish as necessary means to accomplish its purposes?


As a statement of principle, it is right to reiterate as the main opinion does, that ""for the valid exercise of such (the) congressional power, (to expropriate lands for the purpose indicated) that the taking be for public use"", but it is entirely a different matter to imply that in the judicial proceeding instituted towards such end, the Government is still required to present evidence of such public use as a fact. I take it that the constitutional provision itself declares the public objective, purpose or use of the expropriation contemplated, which is the amelioration of long standing socio-agrarian conditions endangering the very ideology on which our government and way of life rest, hence, it should follow that as long as a congressional legislation declares that the condemnation of a particular land is for the specific purpose stated in the Constitution, it is not for the judiciary to inquire as to whether or not the taking of such land is for public use. The Constitution itself which is supposed to be the supreme law on private property rights declares it to be so, and leaves it to Congress, not to the judiciary, to make the choice of the lands to be taken to attain the objective the constituent assembly aimed to achieve. The scope and the limit of the power of the judiciary in this regard is only to determine the existence of enabling legislation, to see to it that the facts are as contemplated in such enabling act and to provide the vehicle for compliance with procedural due process in the implementation of the congressional act.


The concurring and dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Teehankee, particularly because he is joined by our eminent Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion and three of my distinguished senior colleagues, Messrs. Justices Jose B. L. Reyes, Arsenio Dizon and Fred Ruiz Castro, commends itself for the deep concern it holds for individual property rights, 
albeit
 personally, I feel that the present tendency the world over is to meet the exigencies arising from the seemingly inevitable constant increase of population of all countries, the most important of which is to provide people with lands to cultivate or to live on. To paraphrase the thoughts of Mr. Justice Makalintal in 
ACCFA vs. Confederation of Unions
, G.R. No. L-21484, November 29, 1969, expressed in the quotation contained in the main opinion in this case, here as almost everywhere else the irreversible trend is towards socialization of economic resources. It is my considered view that the task to cope with this challenge of the times is primarily with the political departments of our government and not with the judiciary, more so, when, as in the particular aspect of governmental powers to solve social problems, the Constitution itself more than hints a drift along the universal course I have just pointed out and in unmistakable words allocates such powers to the legislature. I am afraid that if the opinion of my brethren is pursued to its logical conclusion, there is danger that the judiciary may be over-reaching the traditional boundaries of its faculties at the expense of the other departments who should be in a better position than the courts to determine the factual bases of any social action needed at any given time. To the extent however, that Mr. Justice Teehankee holds that the matter of whether or not, in a given case, the expropriation in pursuance of an enabling law expressly stating that it should be for the purpose of subdividing a land for resale to tenants is indeed to be done for that specified objective, I agree with my learned colleague. In other words, in any instance where it is shown that contrary to the assumption of Congress, a land has already been subdivided and all or almost all of it are already the subject of conventional transactions between the owners and the occupants thereof, even if this happens after the enactment of the law and its actual implementation, I would hold that the law is inoperative, or no longer so, but not unconstitutional.


With all due respect to the writer of the main opinion whose prolific pen and capacity to make lengthy dissertations on constitutional rights in the context of the development of political, social and economic forces, from his own point of view and more, from those of great legal and judicial exponents thereof, native and foreign, with more of the latter rather often, is unequalled in this Court, in my humble view, the questions of property rights involved in this case have been so foreclosed in the letter of the constitutional precept itself, in its evident spirit and, if recourse to it is still needed, in the deliberations in the constitutional convention of 1934, as to need any lengthy discussion. On these bases, I consider the specific authority granted under the provision in question as an exception to the Bill of Rights. After all, it is not alone the judiciary that can serve as forum for the objections to the exercise of the power so granted because the landowners concerned can make their representations before Congress which as I have said is in a better position to solve social and economic problems.


No less than two of the foremost legal luminaries known to the bench and bar, Delegates Eusebio Orense of Batangas and Vicente J. Francisco of Cavite reminded their colleagues of the risks to private property right the envisaged congressional authority entailed. Neither their lucid explanations nor their unerring logic could overcome the consensus that was formed after the appeals of Delegates Miguel Cuaderno of Bataan and Florentino Saquin of Zamboanga to the Convention to put an end to the social problems pointed out in the speech of Delegate Cuaderno quoted in the main opinion. Delegate Jose B. Conejero of Albay tried to help the opponents, and subsequent to the session of January 29, 1935 when the attempt to eliminate or emasculate the proposal was debated, in the session of the succeeding day, no less than the vice-president of the convention delivered a privileged speech in a vain effort to turn the tide. So stirring was the impassioned speech of Delegate Ruperto Montinola of Iloilo that Delegate Ruperto Kapunan of Leyte attempted to move for the reconsideration of the action taken by the convention the day before, but again the convention remained immutable. By another parliamentary maneuver, Delegate Eusebio Lopez of Batangas tried to reopen the question and upon being upheld by the chair, occasion arose for Delegates Orense, Filemon Sotto of Cebu, Lopez himself, Jose Locsin of Negros Occidental and Manuel Briones of Cebu to indulge in such an illuminating and instructive debate on practically all aspects of the matter embellished by the complete mastery of language of the speakers, that a reading of these portions of the deliberations should settle all doubts as to where the heart of the convention was. I would have attempted to follow the usual fashion of quoting choice portions to add force and beauty to this opinion, but, I have found the try futile, as it would certainly fail to convey with adequate fidelity the wisdom, the patriotism, the social consciousness and the fullsome comprehensiveness of the consensus that prevailed, and rather than risking the pitfall of projecting individual opinions of particular members, no matter how prominent and prestigious in talent and love of country or social activism, as the intent of the convention as a whole, and in order also that all those who may read the decision and the separate opinions in this case may examine them from a fairer perspective, and more importantly, so that those who are apprehensive and jittery about the forthcoming constitutional convention may have an insight into how Filipinos, once given the responsibility, truly act as such, with only the interest of the nation upper-most in their minds and hearts, I am making as an annex of this opinion and an integral part hereof, a scanned Ricohfax copy of the complete record of the deliberations I have mentioned above which took place on January 29 and 30, 1935 on the floor of the constitutional convention of 1934, as they are reported in Vol. VI, pp. 533 to 594 (excluding pp. 559-564) of the Proceedings of the Philippine Constitutional Convention by laurel. Indeed, no portion of this debate should be lost to history and our posterity.


It may just as well be also stated, at this juncture, in the interest of historical truth, that the social philosophy underlying the constitutional provision herein involved is neither new nor purely indigenous. Truth to tell, the idea of opening public agricultural lands for acquisition, without compensation in the case of natives who are actual occupants thereof, or lease by individuals and corporations, with such limited areas as to afford as many persons as possible the opportunity to enjoy such privilege of acquiring or leasing was already in the first legislative organic law of this country, the Philippine Bill of 1902, enacted by the American Congress. (Secs. 14 and 15) Anent the expropriation of private lands, the Philippine Bill of 1902, in its Section 64 already ""authorized"" the government to exercise the right of eminent domain ""in respect of any lands, easements, appurtenances and hereditaments which, on the thirteenth of August, eighteen hundred and ninety eight, were owned or held by associations, corporations, communities, religious orders, or private individuals in such large tracts or parcels of land and in such manner as in the opinion of the Commission injuriously affect the peace and welfare of the people of the Philippine Islands"" and our present Constitution provides parallelly in Sec. 4, Art. XIII, that ""the Congress may authorize, upon payment of just compensation, the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at costs to individuals.""


I would like to close by saying that I consider it necessary to view the question before Us beyond its socio-economic aspect as such, and to realize that fundamentally what the Constitution envisages in the precept under discussion is to bring soonest possible to a reality the slogan of land to the landless. In the jargon of the activists, the accomplishment of this end is no longer an open option for us, it, is an irreversible commitment unmistakably written by our constituent fathers.


EXCERPTS FROM THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE

PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AS 

COMPILED BY DR. JOSE P. LAUREL
 **


Parece que hay enmiendas por supresion del Articulo nueve. Haganse constar los nombres de dichas enmiendas.


VARIOS DELEGADOS. Para un turno en pro. Para un turno en contra.


EL PRESIDENTE. Que dice el Comite?


SR. LOCSIN. No aceptamos.


SR. ROXAS. Señor Presidente, para una aclaracion a los proponentes de la enmienda. Habria objecion de que se subdivida esta enmienda por supresion, porque el articulo envuelve dos proposiciones: la primera es facultar a la Asamblea Nacional para que determine la extension de terreno que un particular o una corporation pueda adquirir: la segunda parte permits al gobierno expropiar grandes latifundios o terrenos; pero subdivididos a los terrantenientes y vendidos al precio de 
cost
, si el bien publico lo demands, mediante compensacion.


Señor Presidente, yo propongo la mocion de que se subdivida la enmienda por supresion; que la primera parte tenga por objeto la supresion de las palabras 
The National Legislative may determine by law
 y que la segunda parte de la enmienda tenga por objeto la supresion de las siguientes palabras: It may authorize the expropriation of lands. No he hecho mas que una proposicion de que se subdivida la enmienda y pido que se vote.


EL PRESIDENTE. Si no hay objecion, se hard asi. (
No hubo objecion
.) Esta en order la mocion para suprimir la primera parte de la disposicion.


MR. SEVILLA. Mr. President, I rise for a parliamentary inquiry. I have an amendment to Section 9 for the partial suppression of a word in said section — the word ""individuals"". I want to know from the Chair, if the amendment for the suppression of the entire section is lost, what will happen with my amendment?


THE PRESIDENT. If the Assembly will vote maintaining this clause, you can present your amendment.


MR. VINZONS. I move that there will be no debate on this question and that the voting be nominal.


EL PRESIDENTE. Tiene la palabra el Delegado por Batangas.


SR. ORENSE. Señor Presidents; Caballeros. En mi humilde opinion, debe suprimirse esta facultad que se concede a la Asamblea Nacional para limitar la extension de los terrenos agricolas privados que de boy en adelante puede adquirir cualquier individuo corporacion o association. Es para mi esta disposicion causa por la cual morira toda iniciativa, todo incentive en el trabajo o en la labor que un individuo debe ejercer para adquirir una propiedad y poder luego gozar de ella una vez adquirida con el sudor de su frente para despues legal a sus seres queridos. Si vamos a limitar o vamos a conceder esta facultad que Ileva consigo la limitacion de la propiedad que puede un individuo, corporacion o association adquirir, tendremos aun que muchos de nuestros terreinos incultos uedardn an mas in cultos de lo que estrin Creo que debemos propulsar, facilitar medios para que esas grandes extensiones de terreno que aparecen incultos e improductives, lo sean de hoy en adelante porque los necesita la nacion. Pido, pues a vosotxos que vosotros por la supresion de esta primera parte y tambien de la segunda parte, cuando la votemos.


(
El presidente a las 6:14 p.m. cede la presidencia al Primer Vice Presidente, senor Montinola
.)


SR. SAGUIN. Señor Presidente, yo he pedido un turno en contra de la supresion.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. Tiene la palabra el Delegado Sr. Saguin.


SR. SAGUIN. Señor Presidente, yo creo que la misma filosofia que tiene la disposicion de nuestra Constitution limitado la adquisition de terrenos publicos, muy bien Puede invocarse en lo que respecta a la adquisition de propiedades privados. La razon primordial porque nosotros fijamos un limite en la adquisicion de terrencs publicos es bien conocida por todos; evitar quegrandes propiedades o grandes latifundios, como se ha dicho aqui queden en manos de unas cuantos personas, privando a las generaciones futuras del derecho de adquirir parte de esas propiedades.


Con respecto a las propiedades privados, yo creo debe militar la misma razon. Si nuestra idea es que las propiedades en nuestro pais esten distribuidas de tal manera que el mayor numero posible de sus habitantes tenga medios suficientes para vivir, yo creo que esta limitacion es muy sabia. Quizas no sentiriamos la necesidad de esta limitacion en el estado actual en que nos encontramos, porque todavia existen muchos terrenos que podemos disponer. Pero, al redactor esta constitucion, crea que tenemos la vision puesta no solamente en el estado actual, sino que en lo que va a venir.


SR. CONFESOR. Sr. Presidente, para una pregunta al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. SAGUIN. Si señor.


SR. CONFESOR. No es verdad de que las grandes agitaciones radicales por partes de los Ilamados 
sakdatistas
 y comunistas tienen lugar en los grandes latifundios de Nueva Ecija, Laguna, Pangasinan, y Bataan?


SR. SAGUIN. Yo creo que si. Ademas, si hemos de aprender algo de las lecciones de otras naciones mas adelantadas que nosotros, mas viejas que nosotros, yo creo que la experiencia de las otras naciones nos demuestran que en ellas las propiedades estin bien divididas, y por eso, son las naciones mas estables, son las naciones que sienten menos convulsiones que estin menos expuestas a las revoluciones.


SR. ORENSE Sr. Presidente, para algunas preguntas al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. SAGUIN. Si señor.


SR. ORENSE. No cree S.S. que las leyes contra los latifundios solamente se han promulgado en aquelos paises en donde la poblacion es mas densa que la extension de los terrenos?


SR. SAGUIN. Yo creo que es mucho mas oportuno adoptar una legislacion semejante en nuestro, pais, porque hasta ahora no tenemos ese problema agudo, y tenemos que prever por que puede suceder; de tal suerte que podemos hacer ya una distribucion mas equitativa desde hoy de nuestros terrenos para que en el futuro no tengamos ese problema que existe en otras naciones. Como medida preventiva, yo creo que esta disposicion es muy sabia.


SR. ORENSE. Supongamos que la Legislatura adopte esta provision y la Legislature, verbigracia, dicte una ley diciendo; ningun individuo ni corporacion o asociacion podra adquirir terreno agricola privado, cuya extension page de quinientas o mil hectareas. Se dicta esta ley. Existen actualmente particulares, lo mismo que corporaciones extranjeras poseedoras de terrenos agricolas privados cuya extensiones aun mayor. Si estas corporaciones por necesidades o por imperatives del negocio, tuvieran que liquidar y una asociacion filipina quisiera adquirir, por tener mas de quinientas hectareas esa hacienda, esa asociacion filipina no pueda adquirirla, tendramos que tragar a esa asociacion extranjera?


SR. SAGUIN. En vez de adquirir una asociacion filipina, pues que la adquiera dos asociaciones filipinas, dividiendo la propiedad grande hasta el limite fijado por la ley.


SR. ORENSE. Como quedarian por otra parte, los derechos adquiridos por esa corporacion por ese dueno, que ha adquirido la propiedad bajo un estado de derecho constituido? Vamos a vulnerar tambien esos derechos?


SR. SAGUIN. No creo yo que estaran afectados porque esta disposicion no se dicta para las propiedades actuales, sino para las adquisiciones futures de propiedades.


SR. ORENSE. Pero el caso es que para una adquisicion futura de una propiedad que exceda de quinientas hectareas o de mil hectarea porque es el limite que ha puesto la Legislatura ...


SR. SAGUIN. No hay prohibicion en la venta. La prohibicion aqui es la adquisicion en vez de un comprador para esa propiedad de mil hectareas tendremos dos compradores de quinientas hectareas cada una. No cree S.S. que eso es mejor?


SR. ORENSE Entonces, S.S. patrocina la idea de una comunidad porque puede haber dos, tres, cuatro o cinco compradores, y entonces S.S. patrocinaria de intereses, y con ello S.S. patrocina una teoria que linda con el comunismo.


SR. SAGUIN. No es necesariamente la consecuencia.


SR. CUADERNO. Sr. Presidente para una pregunta al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. SAGUIN. Si señor.


SR. CUADERNO. No es verdad que en las provincias donde existen grandes latifundios, la experiencia siempre ha demostrado que los intereses de los terratenientes han sido siempre sacrificados?


SR. SAGUIN. Eso es lo que tengo entendido.


SR. CUADERNO. Y por eso, debemos evitar que ocurra eso?


SR. SAGUIN. Yo creo que si. Ademis tener en cuenta que esta disposicion no es mandatoria a la Asamblea, Nacional, sino que es una facultad que se le concede para que pueda adoptar una legislacion de semejante naturaleza que sirva de arma para remediar el mal. De modo que puede o no adoptarse por la Asamblea Nacional, segun convengan a las circunstancias.


SR. ORENSE. Sr. Presidente, para otras preguntas al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. SAGUIN. Si, señor.


SR. ORENSE. Segun esta disposicion, no cree S.S. que la Asamblea Nacional en el ejercicio de sus poderes no tendra esta facultad en el ejercicio de lo que Ilaman
 police power
?


SR. SAGUIN. Yo creo que no, porque seria entonces contrario al 
bill
 de derechos que todos nosotros sabemos. Es preciso dar una facultad a la Legislature, para que, en un memento dado de nuestra historia pueda tener la oportunidad de prevenir el mal de que caigan en manos de unas cuantas personas grandes latifundios.


SR. ORENSE. No cree S.S., ademas, que esta disposicion es antagonica al principio enunciado en el 
bill of rights
 sobre el derecho de propiedad?


SR. SAGUIN. Si es antagonica, debe ser una excepcion de la regla. La disposicion del 
bill
 de derechos es la regla general, y esta es una excepcion.


SR. ORENSE. No cree S.S. que a menos que se diga expresamente que es una excepcion, siendo esta una disposicion posterior, bajo la regla de hermenuetica legal, de que la disposicion posterior anula la anterior, quedaria por los suelos el enunciado de principios de 
bill of rights
?


SR. SAGUIN. No lo entiendo asi, hay un principio en hermeneutica legal de que una disposicion particular en frente de una disposicion general, la disposicion particular prevalece en un caso dado.


SR. ORENSE. Pero no acaba de decir S.S. que con esta disposicion no se quiere dar mis que un enunciado de un principio, por el cual debe regir la Asamblea Nacional?


SR. SAGUIN. Es una facultad que se concede a la Asamblea Nacional. Sin esa facultad, probablemente, la Asamblea Nacional no podra adoptar leyes semejantes.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE (Sr. Montinola.) Tiene la palabra el Caballero por Albay, Sr. Conejero.


SR. CONEJERO. Sr. Presidente, debo comenzar por decirles que yo no tengo ningun latifundio, porque mi familia apenas me ha dejado unas cuantos hectareas que apenas bastan para sostenerme. Pero yo me atrevo a hablar en contra de esta disposicion, porque la creo absurda. Yo entiendo que ninguna debe ser castigado por el solo pecado de haber trabajado mas que otros o haber sido mis industrioso que los demas.


SR. CUENCO. Para un turno en contra, Sr. Presidente.


SR. CONEJERO. (
Prosiguiendo
). No veo ninguna razon para que se pueda impedir a ningun individuo a que desarrolle lo que buenamente pueda por sus esfuerzos y sus trabajo, Que culpa tiene uno que ha adquirida o ha heredado una fortuna de sus padres para que se le prive despues tener mas o menos extension de terreno? Porque Sefiores, yo entiendo que es altamente injusto el privar a un individuo el que pueda desarrollarse como mejor le a entender su trabajo y sus fuerzas. Precisamente es ordinario el premiar al que trabaja y castigar al indolente, y con esta disposicion hacemos lo contrario, pues hasta al que trabaja vamos a castigarle, impidiendole que pueda adquirir mas de lo que vamos a poner en la Constitucion. Esto es para mi un absurdo, y con eso entiendo que debe borrarse esto de la Constitucion. He dicho.


SR. BRIONES. Senor Presidente, no se cual va a ser mi posicion parlamentaria en esta cuestion. Yo estoy a favor de que se retenga esta precepto que dice: 
The National Legislature may determine by law the size of agricultural land which individuals, corporations, or associations may hereafter acquire
. Yo estoy conforme con esta proposicion de 
may hereafter acquire
: pero deseo la supresion de las palabras 
and hold
.


VARIOS DELEGADOS. Es igual.


SR. BRIONES. Hay bastante diferencia, Sr. Presidente. Yo estoy conforme con que el Estado filipino formule ya una politica restrictiva de los grandes latifundios en el sentido de que en el futuro, la Asamblea Nacional pueda determinar la medida o la extension que las corporaciones o individuos puedan adquirir. Ahora, no estaria conforme con que se retengan las palabras and hold, porque esto tendria realmente el efecto de vulnerar derechos adquiridos.Y creo que, por lo menos, personalmente mi opinion seria que se respeten derechos adquiridos o posesiones actuales; pero que se prohiban ya las adquisiciones en el futuro, cuando exceda cierto limite. Creo que esa es la politica intermedia, discreta que puede adoptar la Asamblea Nacional.


SR. YSIP. Señor Presidente, para algunas preguntas al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. BRIONES. Si señor.


SR. YSIP. Quiere decir S.S. que patrocina la supresion de las palabras 
and hold
?


SR. BRIONES. Nada mas que esas palabras. El efecto de su supresion es solamente respetar los derechos adquiridos ahora. La Asamblea podra bajo este precepto, si se suprimen las palabras 
and hold
, determinar la extension de hectareas que puedan ser adquiridas por corporaciones o individuos.


SR. YSIP. De modo que esa idea de S.S. la expone en forma de una enmienda por supresion.


SR. BRIONES. Mas bien es un
 perfecting amendment
 ...


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. Esa enmienda no esta en orden todavia.


MR. VINZONS. Mr. President, just an aclaration over that point. The provision says that ""may hereafter acquire and hold."" Don't you believe that by the term ""hereafter"" the rights now vested in individuals, corporations and associations are sufficiently protected without omitting the word ""hold""?


SR. BRIONES. No, esa es mi duda; que la Asamblea Nacional, si se mantienen las palabras and hold, pueda decir, por ejemplo, tal corporacion tiene mil hectareas actualmente, y por lo tanto, puede hacer que se reduzca la extension de terreno que puedan poseer las corporaciones, en cuyo caso, aquellos que estuvieran poseyendo mayor extension de lo que provea la ley, de aprobarse esto por la Asamblea Nacional podrian ser afectados. Esa es mi duda, nada mas.


MR. VINZONS. But the ""holding"" there refers also to the word ""hereafter"". It is a question of interpretation.


SR. BRIONES. Es cuestion de interpretacion.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. Tiene la palabra el Delegado por Iloilo.


MR. CONFESOR. Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention: To me this is a very timely provision in our Constitution. It embodies a high sense of statesmanship on the part of the Committee that wrote this draft with respect to the limitation of landholdings of individuals and corporations. We must use our sense of observation, gentlemen of the Convention, in arguing in favor or against this draft. We are hearing today that in Spain, a tremendous revolution is taking place. Radical movements, radical uprisings are being noted daily in that new republic. And if we trace the root of the evil, we will find out that the big landholdings in Spain are the root-cause of the radical movements that are taking place in that new republic. Big Russia! Whatis the root-cause of communism in that Bolshevik Republic — big land holdings.Mexico is yearly disturbed by revolution due to what? To big landholdings. History is very clear in this regard — that big landholdings always bring about oppression. It always brings about abuses. Consequently, it produces discontent, which eventually ripens into revolutionary movements. Now, we should adopt this provision in our Constitution to avoid those eventualities of social disturbances. We must use the method of prevention instead of cure,with respect to these social problems.


SR. SALAZAR (V.). Señor Presidente para unas preguntas al orador.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. El orador puede contester si le place.


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor.


SR. SALAZAR (V.). Esta disposicion faculta a la Asamblea Nacional para limitar la propiedad individual. No es asi?


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor.


SR. SALAZAR (V.). Bien S.S. compredera que se puede adquirir una propiedad mediante compra o mediante herencia. Supongase que la Asamblea Nacional limitase la propiedad privada a 300 hectareas, y S.S. que tiene ya 300 hectareas, heredase de su padre al morir una propiedad que tiene 600 hectareas. S.S. se veria privador de recibir por herencia esa propiedad, porque pasa del limite?


SR. CONFESOR. Si pasa, puede vender la mitad antes de morir.


SR. SALAZAR (V.). Si pero si se muere antes de vender a quien se ha de entregar la herencia? al gobierno?


SR. CONFESOR. El caballero por Leyte debe leer muy bien el precepto, en al sentido de que no puede ser adquirido por el gobierno o por cualquiera una propiedad sin justa compensacion. Asi es que si se puede dar a los herederos 300 hectareas solamente, y si el gobierno decide quedarse con las otras 300, el gobierno debe pagar.


MR. SOBREPEÑA. Is it not true that the acquisitive instinct of man does not know any limitation?


MR. CONFESOR. That is true.


MR.SOBREPERA. Oftentimes that acquisitive instinct of man conflicts with the welfare of society.


MR. CONFESOR. That is true. I cited historical cases to prove that, in Spain, Russia, Mexico and Cuba.


MR. SOBREPEÑA. Is it not true also that it is the un,equal possession of property that is often the cause of domestic instability?


MR. CONFESOR. Very true.


MR. SOBREPEÑA. And to eliminate that instability, and to continue tranquility in the land, there must be at least equal possession of property?


MR. CONFESOR. That is true.


MR. GRAGEDA. Will the gentleman yield?


MR. CONFESOR. Surely.


MR. GRAGEDA. The question is this: For example you are a very rich man and you have five hundred hectares of land; but according to law passed by the Legislature, no man must hold more than 500 hectares of land. Here is a poor man with ten hectares of land. He has nobody to sell it to except you. But you cannot acquire it because you will be then acquiring more than what is permitted by law, and therefore, this person will be deprived of the right to sell that land to you. In that case, will not the law be oppressive?


MR. CONFESOR. Therein lies the wisdom of this provision because the state prohibits him, that poor man, to alienate his property. As a matter of fact, it is protecting this man by preventing him from alienating his property to the richer man.


MR. GRAGEDA. But for example, he needs to sell his property in order to maintain himself and his family, and you are willing to pay a good price for that. In that case, will not the law be oppressive to the poor man?


MR. CONFESOR. Precisely for that very reason, this provision is proposed to be inserted in this Constitution to deprive that man of his landholding.


MR. CABILI. You said that this provision in the Constitution would, to some extent, prevent or suppress communistic or revolutionary tendency?


MR. CONFESOR. Yes.


MR. CABILI. Don't you think that this provision in the Constitution would promote revolutionary movement in the Philippines because it would encourage communist leaders to propagate that the people should vote for them because once elected, they will work that lands should be sub-divided?


MR. CONFESOR. As a matter of fact, provision is an antidote to socialistic movement. Now there are agitations and there are violent agitations to sub-divide big landed estates because those people have no recourse to legal and peaceful means. Now we provide for a legal and peaceful means of sub-dividing big landed estates.


MR. CABILI. Precisely because there is an incentive or encouragement. Because of the provision of the Constitution here, it would promote revolutionary movement, because there is a greater belief that if the people want them, they would work for such provision.


MR. CONFESOR. I don't agree with the gentleman from Lanao.


MR. SEVILLA. Does not the gentleman believe that for the same reason that under Section 9, the last sentence authorizes the government to expropriate land, there is no necessity for limiting the size of agricultural lands which any private person may acquire because the government may expropriate his land?


MR. CONFESOR. The first part is a compliment of the second part.


MR. SEVILLA. But the second part make useless the first part?


MR. CONFESOR. The first part is a necessary counterpart of the second part.


MR. SEVILLA. But don't you think that if the government is given authority to expropriate land, there is no necessity for limiting the size of agricultural lands, because the government is given authority to expropriate?


MR. CONFESOR. The government inquires the necessity of the individual to expropriate any landed estate. Now, there is no necessity because there is that preventive measure on the part of the government to limit the size of the land.


MR. SEVILLA. That is precisely my point. There is no necessity for the preventing measure because the government is authorized to expropriate the estate of the individual. 


MR. CONFESOR. What we want is to avoid the process of expropriation if possible, by limiting the size of the landed estate.


MR. SEVILLA. You want to avoid the process of expropriations, why insert in Section 9 then?


MR. CONFESOR. It is a necessary compliment.


MR. SEVILLA. Mr. President, I do not get the point of the gentleman.


SR. PAREDES. No es verdad, senor Confesor, que en varias partes de Filipinas hay individuos que son propietarios de grandes latifundios?


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor, eso es verdad.


SR. PAREDES. Y segun esa disposicion, esos individuos permanecerin siendo propietarlos de esos grandes latifundios?


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor.


SR. PAREDES. Y segun esa disposicion, los individuos que nazcan desde ahora no podrian adquirir grandes latifundios, como esos grandes latifundios que pertenecen a esos individuos privilegiados?


SR. CONFESOR. Si señor. Vamos a evitar la condicion que existe ahora en Dinalupihan, en que cada afio hay alli casi una revuelta entre los terratenientes.


SR. PAREDES. No cree Su Senoria ahora que con eso habra un desigualdad de clases?


SR. CONFESOR. No, señor.


SR. PAREDES. Los que nazcan desde hay, aunque quieran tener grandes terrenos, no podrin, tenerlos, en cambio: los que hacieron ayer permaneceran en sus grandes propiedades. No cree Su Senoria que habra una revolucion?


SR. CONFESOR. No, señor.


SR. CONEJERO. Entiendo que Su Senorita favorece la primera parte, por lo menos del Articulo 9, no es asi?


SR. CONFESOR. Si senor.


SR. CONEJERO. Permitame Su Sefioria poner un ejemplo: Su Senoria, como buen trabajador, consigue amazar, digamoslo asi, por ejemplo, 5000 hectareas de terreno. Nosotros vamos a limitar a 1,000 hectareas lo que puede adquirir una persona privada. Su Senoria no llega a tener mas que un hijo. Como se ven a quedar las 4000 hectareas que quedan de sobran de lo que tiene Su Senoria, porque su hijo no puede heredar mas que 1,000 hectareas?


SR. CONFESOR. Voy a contestar esa pregunta dandole a Su Senoria, un ejemplo practico, pero en la forma inversa. Hay un pueblo o hay un municipio en Pangasinan que esta poseido por una familia solamente; eso quiere decir que los miembros de esa familia solamente tienen terrenos donde levantar sus casas o sus manciones, pero en ese municipio, fuera de esa familia, ninguno tiene ni un pedazo de terreno donde caerse muerto, quiere Su Senoria que se prevalezea esa condicion en ese municipio?


EL PRESIDENTE. El tiempo del orador ya ha expirado.


DISCURSO EN CONTRA DEL SR. FRANCISCO


SR. FRANCISCO. Señor Presidente.


EL PRESIDENTE. Señor Delegado por Cavite.


SR. FRANCISCO. Caballeros de la Convencion: Antes de discutir la enmienda, permitame que llame la atencion de esta Asamblea hacia el Articulo 10 del draft, que dice: ""Ningun terreno agricola o propiedad particular se podra transferer o enagenar o ceder a ninguna personal, corporacion o asociacion que no estuviese qualificada para adquirir terrenos publicos en las Islas Filipinas."" De modo que tenemos ya aqui una disposicion que hace imposible que propiedades particulares, de grandes extensiones, puedan pasar a manos extranjeras. Pero no obstante esta disposicion, por medio del parrafo 1, Articulo 9, se trata de conceder a las Legislatura facultad para determinar por ley la extension de terrenos, privados que puede adquirir o poseer corporaciones o asociaciones, de hoy en adelante.


Caballeros de la Convencion: Yo no estoy opuesto a que se provea de todas las garantias o restricciones en cuanto a la adquisicion de terrenos publicos, pero yo digo que debemos ir con cuidado en inmiscuirse en los derechos privados. Por medio de la disposicion que se discute, a mi modo de ver, se trata de involucrar el derecho o la libertad de la propiedad particular tan fundamental como el derecho a la vida. La libertad de la propiedad es una consecuencia includible el derecho a la vida. Cada hombre es libre de adquirir, conserver, gozar y disponer de los bienes que constituyen su patrimonio. Considero que esa disposicion es un atentado al derecho de la propiedad, y digo que es un atentado al derecho de la propiedad por los casos practicos que se han expuesto ante esta Asamblea. Supongamos que, debido a la limitacion de la produccionn del azucar, los agricultores del Sur, duenos de grandes extenones, no pudiesen cultivar sus terrenos, plantar azucar, y quisiesen vender sus terrenos a los agricultores del Norte para dedicarlos al cultivo del palay, y supongamos que la Asamblea promulga una ley prohibieiado que se pueda enajenar o poseer terrenos en una extension de 300 hectareas, que pasarian a los agricultores del Sur, que no pueden plantar azucar en sus terrenos, o no estando en condiciones economicas para cultivar sus terrenos, se les privari de vender sus propiedades a los agricultores del Norte? Que pasarian, si un hombre, por ejemplo, no pudiendo cultivar su terreno se viera en la necesidad, para vivir, de vender el terreno que posee,y ese terreno supongamos que excediera de 300 hectareas, y la Legislatura o la Asamblea dijera que no se podra adquirir terrenos por mas de 300 hectareas.Que pasaria a ese individuo? El resultado seria que ese individuo no tendria mas remedio que abandonar el terren no tendria ni para pagar el amillaramiento, cual seria el resultado de esta? No pudiendo el individuo pagar siquiera el amillaramiento, el gobierno no tendria otra cosa que hacer que embarcar esa propiedad, y en resumidas cuentas, en vez de que esa propiedad pasara a manos de un tercero para que pueda cultivarla y pagar el amillaramiento de la misma al gobierno, el resultado seria que el dueno se quedari con ese terreno sin poder cultivarlo y Sin poder pagar su contribucion al gobierno. Tenemos el caso planteado aqui de un padre de familia que tiene una propiedad extensa, supongamos de mil hectareas: la Asamblea o la Legislatura promulga una ley que prohibe la adquisicion o posesion por una persona de mas de 300 hectareas, y ese padre de familia quiere mejorar a un hijo suyo, que es al unico a quien quiere dejar todas sus propiedades; si esas propiedades excedieran de 300 hectareas, por el limite fijado por la Legislature, que pasaria a esa propiedad, o con el exceso de esa propredad, o en otras palabras, cual seria el 
status
 de esa propiedad? Podriamos obligar al gobierno a que expropie esa propiedad, o sea, las 700 hectareas restantes? Como se puede obligar al gobierno a que expropie esa propiedad? Ustedes saben muy bien que bajo el 
Bill of Rights
, dos son log requisites de expropiacion: primero necesidad, publica y segundo compensacion justa. Si el gobierno necesita de esa propiedad, que pasara con esa propiedad, cual sera su 
status
? Aqui se ha hablado de latifundio, pero entiendo que no existe latifundio aqui tal como esta palabra se entiende, poseer 500 hectareasde terreno no constituye latifundio, El latifundio es un problema en Mejico y en los Estados Subamericanos, pero aqui, en Filipinas, no existe tal problemas; y si bien es verdad que algunos creen que por medio de esa disposicion se ha de impedir que algunas corporaciones extranjeras posean grandes extensiones de terreno, yo pregunto: es esta disposicion el remedio para impedir que esas corporaciones sigan poseyendo esos latifundios o extensiones grandes de terreno? Por que puede ser este el remedio? Si nadie puede adquirir mis que la extension que fija la ley, supongamos 300 hectareas,y una corporacion extranjera mil o dos mil hectareas quien comprara esa propiedad? El gobierno puede comprar, aqui dicen. Bajo que disposicion? Estamos discutiendo la primera disposicion, y al discutir la primera disposicion se ha pedido el consentimiento de esta Asamblea para que esta disicion sea independiente o se discuta independientemente de la segunda disposicion. Si el gobierno quiere expropiar, crea que debe atenerse a la disposicion del 
Bill of Rights
, o sea, debe expropiar mediante justa compensacion y mediante razones de necesidad publica. Pero debemos tener una valla cuando se trata de terrenos o derechos privados y creo que es suficiente valla lo dispuesto en el Bill of Rights, mantengamos el 
Bill of Rights
 tal como existe y no creo yo que sea justo que nosotros aprobemos esa disposicion que, a mi juicio envuelve una cuestion fundamental cual es al del del individuo a la libertad y propiedad.


SR. NAVARRO. Su Senoria dijo que en Filipinas no existen latifundios.


SR. FRANCISCO. Ante todo quisiera saber de Su Senoria que entiende por grandes latifundios?


SR. NAVARRO. Precisamente usted hablo de la latifundios, quisiera saber de Su Senoria si una hacienda de veinticuatro mil hectareas poseida por una corporacion no es latifundio?


SR. FRANCISCO. Yo entiendo que no es latifundio: latifundio en Mexico y en la America del Sur son extensiones de doscientos mil hectareas.


SR. NAVARRO. En que diccionario se encuentra eso.


SR. FRANCISCO. Si no se encuentra en aln diccionario, tampoco podria encontrarse latifundios en extensiones de veinticuatro mil hectareas.


SR. NAVARRO. No recuerda Su Senoria que al inaugurarse el gobierno filipino bajo la administracion de los Estados Unidos, una de las principales medidas que adopte el Gobierno de Filipinas es la adquisicion de la hacienda de los frailes para ser distribuida entre los filipinos?


SR. FRANCISCO. La pregunta del companero, senor Navarro, si no es verdad que al inaugurarse el Gobierno de las Islas Filipinas lo primera que hizo fud adquirir la hacienda del los frailes. Me alegro que se me haya hecho esa pregunta. Bien, es verdad; pero esa facultad concedida a la Legislatura para promulgar leyes que adquieran las haciendas de los frailes estaba basada en una disposicion de la ley del Congreso de 1902, que requiere como requisite dos cosas primero que esos terrenos deben ser terrenos de grandes extensiones y segunda voy a leer la ley mismo con respecto a la segunda parte: ""que a juicio de la Comission Civil sea perjudicial a la paz y bienestar el gobierno filipino,"" condiciones estas que no existen en el 
draft
 que ahora se somete a la consideracion de ustedes.


SR. NAVARRO. No recuerda Su Senoria que en las instrucciones del Presidente McKinley a la Comission Civil se mencionaba precisamente que la posesion de grandes haciendas por las corporaciones religiosas es una de las causas de la revolucion contra el Gobierno Español y recomendaba el Presidente McKinley la adquisicion de esas haciendas?


SR. FRANCISCO. Yo admito que cuando la posesion de grandes extensiones de terreno constituyen una amenaza a la paz y el bienestar del Gobierno de Filipinas, el Gobierno debe tener derecho de adquirir esas extensiones de terreno para revenderlas a los particulares, pero este no es el caso en el precepto que nosotros discutimos. En el precepto que nosotros discutimos se dice sencillamente lo siguiente:






Sec. 9.	The National Legislature may determine by law the size of private agricultural land which individuals, corporations, or associations may hereafter acquire and hold. It may authorize the expropriation of lands to be thereafter subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to individuals.






Nada mas Convietase esto en el lenguaje en que esta redactado el 
bill
 de Filipinas y quizas podremos considerar, estariamos mas inclinados a sostener el draft que no tal como esta ahora, porque ahora podria occurrirsele a la Legislatura aprobar un 
bill
 en el sentido de que una persona no podria poseer mis que doscientos hectareas, no pueda poseer mas que trescientas hectareas, sin ninguna restriccion o modificacion y eso no esta bien cuando se trata de propiedad particular individual.


EL VICE PRESIDENTE. El Comite va a cerrar el debate.


MR. CUADERNO. Mr. President, this will be my last speech in the Convention. And I just want to remind the Convention of the first speech that I delivered — the first speech I delivered before this Assembly. I believe, Mr. President, that one of the best provisions that this draft of the Constitution contains is this provision that will prevent the repetition of the history of misery, of trials and tribulations of the poor tenants throughout the length and breadth of the Philippine Islands. I am a living witness to the sufferings of thousands of people that live in and around the big landed estates. Delegates elected in the provinces and living in Manila ignore completely the sufferings that these people and their children have undergone from the time of Rizal; and the gentleman from Batangas says ""no"". I want to read the novels of Rizal decrying the fate of these poor people of the big landed estates.


THE PRESIDENT. Time is up.


MR. VINZONS. I move that a nominal voting be made. This is an important question.


(
En este momenta el Vice Presidente, Sr. Montinola, abandons el estrado, ocupandolo el Presidente, Hon. Claro M. Recto
.)


SR. CONEJERO. Para una cuestion privilegiada. Pido que se levante la sesion. Ya son las siete.


EL PRESIDENTE. La hora reglamentaria es hasta a las ocho.


Puede votarse la enmienda?


MR. VINZONS. Mr. President I move that the votation be nominal.


EL PRESIDENTE. La Mesa desea saber si hay numero suficiente que apoye la mocion.


Los que esten conformes con la mocion que se pongan de pie. (
Varios Sres. Delegado se ponen de pie
.)


Hay numero suficiente que apoya la mocion.


Lease la lista.


Los que conformes con la supresion de la primera parte de este articulo contestaran si. .Los que no lo esten contestaran no.


SR. ENRIQUEZ. Podemos razonar nuestros votos?


EL PRESIDENTE. Puede insertarse en los records despues.

DELEGATE SEVILLA IN CONNECTION 

WITH SEC. 7


MR. SEVILLA. Mr. President: We are witnessing today the last political act of a great and generous nation in behalf of a weak but grateful people. In this most difficult hour of our Destiny, we, who have been privileged by Fate to frame and weave the Great Document that shall proclaim to the world the birth of a new nation conceived in the mutual faith and trust of two peoples, have in our hands the delicate task of seeing to it that this gem of our handicraft will not only be the bulwark of our liberties, but also the anchorage of the peace, happiness and welfare of our posterity. We have the lesson of the Past for our guidance; we have the problems of the present for our solution; and still we have the hazards of the unknown Future to safeguard and to protect ourselves and our children against.


God, in His Infinite Charity, has endowed our people with a patrimony of 155,000 square miles of islands, rich in minerals and abounding in natural resources. So rich are they have been a perpetual source of invitation to foreign avarice and temptation. A brief review of history shows us that they already have been the subject of several conquest and reconquest by foreign nations ever since the days of Magellan, Limahong, and Dewey. But the brown people, weak as it is, served its first notice to the world of ""The Philippines for the Filipinos alone"" ever since that day when the brave little warriors of Mactan heroically gave their lives for the defense and preservation of their territory. Spain brought us her religion and taught us the existence of God; but while we were looking up towards Heaven for the salvation of our souls, our lands were quickly disappearing beneath our feet. Subquently when Admiral Dewey landed the American marines on the shores of Manila Bay, their motives were misconstrued by the natives, who by this time have already reconquered their lost dominion; and for the second time the brown man hoisted his notice of ""The Philippines for the Filipinos alone,"" until the last guerrilla warfare was subdued by experienced soldiery and superior force of arms. In the Treaty of Paris, however, the extensive landholdings of the religious orders were recognized, thereby preserving the last distasteful relic of Spanish subjugation.


The doctrine however, of the ""The Philippines for the Filipinos"" was recognized by the United States more than once, not only in President McKinley's Instruction to the Philippine Commission, but also in the Philippine Bill of 1902, in the Jones Law of 1916, and finally, in the Tydings McDuffie Law. And now that the tutelage of the American Republic is coming to an end, now that we shall become the Great American Trustee, it is time we should renew our pledge to that sublime doctrine written with Lapu-lapu's blood for the first time at Mactan and subsequently rewritten with Gregorio del Pilar's at Tirad Pass, no longer through the shedding of blood and sacrifice in lives of our people, but simply through an enunciation in our fundamental law, which we now have the privilege of drafting, of a provision for the nationalization of our lands and natural resources.


Mr. President, history has taught us that economic vassalage of one nation by another is worse than political slavery. Such a state of affairs invariably breeds discontent among the natives of the servient, country and engenders mutual distrust among their citizens. It is inimical to domestic tranquility and is a hatching ground for international complications; hence, dangerous to the peace of humanity. No nation can have political security and stability if her citizens do not enjoy absolute freedom and prosperity and these are impossible in a country whose natural resources and public domain are controlled by a foreign master. As if a challenge hurled at the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our race, the Filipino nation is being hatched today in the midst of an economic turmoil, in a world gone mad for economic supremacy where the primitive law of the survival of the fittest seems to be the only code between nations.


Just a little north of the Philippines is a powerful industrial Empire whose machines perpetually hum the eternal clamor for more raw materials, which in other words means more land. The perpetual drome of her machines is being heard far and wide, in the remotest corners of the world, because she is engaged in a huge international competition of outselling all others in every available market of the globe. She would brook no interference, and sometimes would respect no international law to achieve her purposes. She justifies her acts by invoking the first law of nature — self-preservation.


The Philippine Islands today has still an extensive area of nearly 30 million hectares of public lands of which but 1/5 have felt the touch of human hands. The rest are still lying idle in tropical fertility which if worked and cultivated can supply most any of the raw material needed by any industrial nation and capable of supplying the needs of a hundred million people. The disposition of these lands are at present governed by the so-called Act No. 2874 of the Philippine Legislature. By this Act only the natives of the Philippines or corporations 61% of whose stocks are owned by natives or Americans may buy or lease agricultural public lands. A native may buy 100 hectares and lease 1,024 hectares. Corporations can both buy or lease 1,024 hectares. Not long ago, I remember there was a movement to liberalize this law so as to invite foreign capital to come in. It was then that the halls of the Legislature rang with the famous debates of the statesmen finally making it a day for the conservatives. I believed then, and I still believe now that, that was a day of triumph, not only for the defenders of the law, but also for our people and our posterity. But even then, let us be frank with ourselves now and be courageous enough to admit that there is still much to be desired with our present law. To cite just one instance, there are provisos in Act No. 2874 allowing citizens of countries the laws of which grant citizens of the Philippine Islands the same rights to acquire and lease public lands, also the right of leasing or buying public lands in the Philippines. A clever nation for example, whose every nook of her territory, whose every inch of her public land is already occupied or has already been given away to her people might extend to our citizens this tempting privilege of acquiring public land or domain therein just to take advantage of the reciprocity granted in these provisos. And then why shall we want, why shall we expect to acquire lands in other countries when right before us, in this very country of our birth, are millions of hectares of virgin soil merely awaiting the pioneering spirit of our race.


Even without these useless provisos, we have seen how crafty foreigners have cunningly eluded the penal provisions of our laws and despoiled us of our choicest regions in the South. Davao is now a veritable Japanese colony. Let us put more teeth to our laws. Let us not only make the nationalization of our lands and natural resources a subject of ordinary legislation but also of constitutional enactment. Let not the soil moistened with the sweat of our brows and drenched with the blood of our martyrs pass away into alien hands. Let not our children be mere tenants and trespassers in their own country. Let us preserve and bequeath to them the land that is rightfully theirs, free from all foreign liens and encumbrances. Let this God's first and greatest gift to the Filipino race be secured for all times for the interest of that race alone and no more. ""It was this interest in the soil of his native land,""said a famous orator, ""which made the love of that country so strong a passion in the breast of the Roman citizen. It was this which made every Roman glory in the name and hold himself forever ready to fight and die for his country."" Let us emulate this inspiring example of the Romans and reserve the Philippines for the Filipinos alone. If they call this selfishness, then let us be selfish, but wise enough to provide for the safety of our lands from foreign interlopers. Let us be selfish, if but for the primitive reason of protecting our citizens and preserving the integrity of our dominion and Commonwealth; let us be selfish, but at least we will have been freed from possible international entanglements which might upset the peace of the Orient and bring woe unto ourselves.


Gentlemen of the Convention: Our forefathers, our heroes and martyrs are peacefully slumbering beneath the verdure of these tropical lands. The ashes of our dead are being guarded in the bosom of our native soil. You and I, all of us gathered here today will sooner or later, need the call of our Fate and deliver our dust back, to this land of our birth. Let it be that this ancestral soil, where rest the bones of our sires, this beautiful land which shall gather again our ashes back to its fold, be ours alone, for our children and our grandchildren to love and preserve, that our remains be not disturbed in their eternal repose by unfamiliar hands and trampled upon by alien feet.


I thank you.


SPEECH BY DELEGATE CINCO


MR. CINCO. Mr. President and Colleagues: In view of the great importance of the matter under consideration before the Assembly, I have asked for the floor and consequently your indulgence for a brief moment. The amendment under discussion is the suppression of the first part of Section 9 of the draft under General Provisions, namely, ""The National Legislature may determine by law the size of private agricultural lands, which individuals, corporations, or associations may hereafter acquire and hold.


I should like to deal as briefly on the subject as there were other speakers who have preceded me. In answer to an observation by a previous speaker in favor of the amendment that, while he believes the second part of said Section 9 is a wise provision, the first part which is now under discussion is not and, therefore, must be suppressed. I should like to say that the first part of Section 9 is a corollary of the second part. In fact, I believe the two sentences of Section 9 should exchange places, that is, the second part as now stands in the draft, should be placed in the first part, but both sentences must stand in the same Section. If we want to authorize the National Assembly to expropriate big parcels of land to be thereafter subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to individuals, it is because we are in principle against big landholdings. So, it is but reasonable that the National Assembly should also be given the authority to determine by law the size of private agricultural lands which persons may hereafter acquire and hold.


It should also be borne in mind that the draft is not obligatory on the National Legislature when it provides that the National Legislature may determine by law, and I invite you to the use of the word ""may"". It means that the National Legislature will use the power we sought to confer upon it when, and only when, the necessity for its exercise will have arisen.


It has been argued here that the proposed provision is unjust and discriminatory against the hard working citizens of the country, who, being such, may acquire a large private agricultural land. To this, I should like to say that it is my wish that our agricultural lands be as much equally distributed in the course of time from today among the citizens of this country as can legitimately be done, for I believe that such distribution of private agricultural lands will render the country and our government a more lasting peace and stability.


I should like also to invite the attention of my colleagues to what is happening in municipalities where big 
haciendas
 exist and in which thousands of tenants work. The owners of these 
haciendas
 practically control the results of any election held on those communities. Whoever candidates are favored by these landlords are inevitably elected through the instrumentality of tenancy. Who is the tenant who will not abide with the dictates of his landlord?


For all that I have stated and those of the speakers who preceded me in support of the draft, I respectfully pray for the rejection of the amendment under consideration. 


I thank you.

EL PRESIDENTE. Al Comite de Ponencia.


SR. MONTINOLA. Señor Presidente, quisiera hacer uso del privilegio de la media hora.


EL PRESIDENTE. Tiene la palabra el Delegado por Iloilo.


MANIFESTACIONES DEL SR. MONTINOLA


SR. MONTINOLA. Señor Presidente Sres. Delegados: Al levantarme boy para dirigiros la palabra, quiero hacer constar mi proposito de hacer un estudio mas detenido del Art. 9 que ayer fue aprobado por esta Asamblea. Yo hubiera querido habiar ayer: pero la falta de oportunidad me privo de este privilegio y antes de entrar en materia quiero hacer constar tambien de que yo no soy propietario de grandes latifundios. Desgraciadamente, poseo poca extension de terreno, lo suficiente para cultivarlo y para mantener las necesidades de mi familia. Tambien hago constar que en la Provincia de Iloilo no hay grandes latifundios. La Provincia de Iloilo es una de las provincias en que la propiedad esta muy dividida. Alli las propiedades no estan acumuladas en manos de unas cuantos personas, y por este motivo, se ha tradado mucho en desarrollar la industria azuearera en Iloilo. Hechas estas declaraciones, voy a, entrar en materia respecto al objeto de la enmienda presentada ayer pidiendo la eliminacion del Art. 9.


Caballeros, por lo que he oido ayer de los discursos pronunciados por varios oradores y particularmente de las intlerpelaciones hechas a los oradores, he llegado a la conclusion de que aqui existe un temor grande con respecto a la acumulacion de las propiedades agricolas en manos de unas cuantas personas.


SR. ESCAREAL. Señor Presidente, para una cuestion de orden. El Delegado por Iloilo esta en el uso del privilegio de la media hora?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor, estoy en al uso del priviegio de la media hora.


SR. ESCAREAL. No se ha pedido el consentimiento unanime de la Convencion. 


VARIOS DELEGADOS. Que siga, que siga.


SR. ORENSE Caballeros, vamos a tener el gusto de oirle a nuestro Vice Presidente.


SR. ESCAREAL. Esta fuera de orden el Delegado por Batangas.


EL PRESIDENTE. Puede proseguir el Delegado por Iloilo.


SR. MONTINOLA. (
Prosiguiendo
.) Caballeros, agradezco vuestra benevolencia al reconocerme para hacer uso de la palabra. Entrando ahora en materia, existe un gran temor, como ya he dicho, de parte le muchos, el que las propiedades esten acumuladas en manos de unas cuantos Personas como las hay ahora, y esta es la creencia que he sacado ayer de las interpelaciones y de log discursos, que muchos creen de que aqui en adelante esas acumulaciones se han de verificar en manos de unas cuantos personas o unas cuantos corporaciones. Se han citado esos grandes latifundios que hay en Nueva Ecija, y se mencionaron esos grandes latifundios que existen en Bataan; pero, Caballeros ros, puedo deciros que esos grandes latifundios no se han formado solamente ahora; esos grandes latifundios de Nueva Ecija se han formado un siglo y medio antes; esos grandes latifundios en Batangas se han formado un siglo antes; esos grandes latifundios de los Tuazon, en Marikina, se ban formado siglos atris, al igual que esos grandes latifundios de los Frailes y es que en aquellos tiempos era facil conseguir grandes latifundios. El que tema influencia en el Gobierno espanol pedia la concesion de largas extensiones mediante una declaracion posesoria instituida ante un juez de paz y por la declaracion de tres testigos de que el solicitante y sus antecesores Ilevaban poseyendo hacia afios esos terrenos. Se pedia la declaracion posesoria como un titulo de su posesion que despues servia titulo para conseguir el titulo real, y por eso era facil conseguir esos grandes latifundios en aquellos tiempos. En Nueva Ecija, cuando se consiguio ese gran latifundio de la familia Gonzales, no habia poblacion todavia alli. Todo era terrenos publicos,que el Gobierno — segun me han informado — por un Real Decreto, consiguio para el progenitor de los Gonzalez un siglo y medio antes de ahora. Entonces todo era bosque, no habia poblacion, no habia pueblo formado. Ahora parte de esos terrenos estan ocupados por ciertos pueblos que se han formado posteriormente, y esa es la razon de la acumulacion de esas propiedades en manos de ciertas y determinadas personas. Hoy ese peligro ha desaparecido. Por la Ley de Terrenos Publicos, ya no se pueden acaparar grandes extensiones de terrenos publicos, ya es imposible que se acumulen grandes propiedades en manos de ciertas y determinadas personas. De aqui en adelante, no hay comerciante, no hay extranjero que invierta dinero y mas dinero en la adquisicion de propiedades agricolas. Actualmente, si algunas propiedades agricolas estan en manos de ciertas personas que poseen ahora miles de hectareas, eso se debe al trabajo de sus qprogenitores que acumularon esas riquezas en manos de su familia. Pero esta no es razon para que nosotros confisquemos ese derecho adquirido de parte de esas personas que han vertido su sudor, que han sacrificado sus vidas y puesto su trabajo para conseguir y acumular esa pequena riqueza que tienen en sus manos ahora.


Caballeros, este precepto limitado la propiedad que puede conseguir un indiniduo o una corporacion, de aqui en adelante, practicamente matara toda iniciativa de parte del individuo, porque una persona que quiera hoy extender sus actividades agricolas para alguna clase de productos, si a la Legislatura se le ocurre friar una extension limitado de 300 a 400 hectares, esa iniciativa tendra que morir, porque es imposible explotar una industria agricola, a base comercial, con poca extension de terreno.


Alguien me dijo anoche que para obviar ese inconvemente, se pueden arrendar terrenos de propietarios colindantes. Yo os digo, al menos basado en mi experiencia alli en las provincias visayas, no se aqui en Luzon, que eso es utopico, porque los propietarios no suelen arrendar sus terrenos mis que por cierto numero de afios, por siete u ocho anos. Y quienn es el que va a invertir dinero en una industria agricola arrendando terrenos por siete u ocho anos? Es imposible completamente, asi es que si un individuo quiere dedicarse a la explotacion de una nueva industria agricola en el pais, como por ejemplo el algodon el 
balatong
 o soybin que Manchuria estan importando 200,000,000 de 
dollars
 en America, y aqui en Filipinas ese producto de puede muy bien cultivar, quien, repito, va a invertir dinero para cultivar este products a base comercial, si no poseyera propiedades que le dieran seguridad de que por algunos anos podria seguir disfrutando, gozando o utilizando sus propiedades agricolas para la explotacion de su negocio?


Caballeros, por otra parte hay el inconveniente que anoche se formule por ciertos Caballeros, y que por cierto no fue contestado satisfactoriamente por ciertos oradores, y es el que se refiere a la herencia. Si un padre de familia que posee 4,000 hectares, y que no tiene mas que un hijo o dos, si despues la Legislatura fijase la extension de terreno que puede adquirir un individuo en 500 hectareas, ese heredero no podria adquirir mas de 500 hectareas. Y que se hara del resto?


SR. CUADERNO. Para la informacion del orador quiero decirle que estoy dispuesto a contestar ese punto en cualquier memento.


SR. MONTINOLA. (
Prosiguiendo
.) Ahora me dirin que se expropiar esas propiedades, que el Gobierno estari dispuesto a expropiar todo el exceso que podrian recibir los herederos de sus padres. Ahora, pregunto, estari dispuesto el Gobierno a expropiar todas esas propiedades que no puedan ser recibidas por cualquier individuo o corporacion, por la prohibicion de la ley? Yo no creo que el Gobierno este dispuesto a invertir dinero en esas propiedades para despues repartirlas a precio de costo a los individuos, porque hay propiedades en donde no hay poblacion, no hay casas, no hay residentes en esas haciendas, lo mismo en Luzon que en Visayas, y a quien va a vendey el gobierno esas propiedades? A personas extranas? La venta que hari el gobierno entiendo se hart mas bien a las personas que ya radican en los mismos sitios, porque si no radican en el mismo sitio, si no tienen casa alli,no creo que compren.


SR. VILLANUEVA (H.). Sr. Presidente, para una aclaracion.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. VILLANUEVA (H.). No es verdad que el Art. 9 solamente autoriza a la Asamblea Nacional para hacer uso de las facultades que nosotros confiamos a ella?


SR. MONTINOLA. Es verdad.


SR. VILLANUEVA (H.). Entonces que temor hay?


SR. MONTINOLA. Porque no si fija laextension, ese es el temor precisamente. 


SR. VILLANUEVA (H.). Para otra aclaracion.


SR. MONTINOLA. Prefiero que me deje continuer, porque lo que S.S. hace no son aclaraciones, son interpelaciones.


(
Prosiguiendo
.) Por eso, Caballeros, hay el caso ese, hay el peligro realmente de que sino se fija la extension, la Legislatura tiene que actuar en cada caso particular.


SR. ORENSE. Sr. Presidente, para algunas preguntas tendentes a ese punto.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si es para ayudar, estoy dispuesto a contestar.


SR. ORENSE. Para ayudar. S.S. como Senador debe estar bien informado de que nuestro gobierno por haberse embarcando en la compra de las haciendas de los frailes para revenderlos en lotes a los terratenientes hasta ahora tiene ereditos por valor de millones de pesos contra es os terratenientes, porque no han podido pagar hasta ahora los. lotes que han comprado.


SR. MONTINOLA. Es cierto.


SR. ORENSE. Por eso digo yo, si hay la mar de terrenos comprados por el gobierno que no estan todavia revendidos a los particulares y que los terrenos que se han vendido todavia no estan pagados, no cree S.S. que el gobierno de hoy en adelante no debe comprar ya terrenos por exceso de ello?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si, señor.


SR. ORENSE. No es verdad que los bonos emitidos por el gobierno para invertir en la compra de esos terrenos, hasta ahora no estan redimidos?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. KAPUNAN. Sr. Presidente, para algunas preguntas al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si es para ayudar, si señor.


SR. KAPUNAN. S.S. esta enterado de los millones y millones de hectareas de terrenos que todavia estan sin explotar y que necesitan la iniciativa particular para su desarrollo?


SR. MONTINOLA. Es verdad.


SR. KAPUNAN. Puede informarme S.S. cuantos millones de hectareas de terreno, que todavia no estan explotadas?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si mal no recuerdo, parece que hay unos doce millones.


SR. KAPUNAN. Y que necesitan de la iniciativa del gobierno y de los particulares?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. KAPUNAN. Y que por consiguiente seria matar la iniciativa, seria impedir que se desarrollen esos terrenos?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


(
Prosiguiendo
.) De manera que si hay se ese impedimento para conseguir los terrenos publicos, el impedimenta que prescribe el Articulo 9 de nuestra 
draft
, es mayor todavia, por que ni siquiera se permite de una manera taxativa y clara que un particular pueda conseguir tal extension de terreno, sino que se deja completamente a la Legislatura.


SR. NIERE. Sr. Presidente para una pregunta al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor, si es para ayudar.


SR.NIERE. Es para ayudarle. Bajo el precepto constitucional que hemos aprobado anoche, no se ha fijado el numero de hectareas, sino que la Legislature es quien debe legislar, no es verdad?


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. NIERE. De modo que S.S. parte del supuesto de que la Asamblea Nacional no ha de actuar sobre una legislacion de conformidad con los intereses del pueblo, no es verdad?


SR. MONTINOLA. Ego no es para ayudar.


SR. MONTAÑO Sr. Presidente, para una pregunta al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. MONTAÑO. No es verdad que la disposicion del draft puede constituir un desaliendo para el desarrollo de la industria del pueblo filipino?


SR. MONTINOLA. Ya he dicho que eso mata la iniciativa de las personas. Es acaso logico que en este 
draft
 se dijera que cada individuo no ha de tener mas que cincuenta mil pesos de propiedad? Porque si se limita el traspaso de la propiedad en cierto numero de hectareas, equivale a limitar la riqueza que puede tener cada individuo. Si a un individuo se le limita que no puede tener mas que treacientas hectareas de terreno, quiere decir que su riqueza esta limitada a eso y no puede expansionar ni puede desarrollar sus actividades, porque se le ha limitado sus medios de desarrollo. Esa es la consecuencia logica que ha de venir en este caso.


SR. RAMOS. Sy. Presidente, para una pregunta al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contestar, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. RAMOS. Con este precepto no es verdad que fomentariamos la indolencia por aquello de que seria mas comodo esperar ya que se repartan las propiedades privadas o particulares, que por lo regular estan cultivadas?


SR. MONTINOLA. Ciertamente.


SR. RAFOLS. Sr. Presidente, para algunas preguntas al orador.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El orador puede contesta, si le place.


SR. MONTINOLA. Si señor.


SR. RAFOLS. La primera parte del Art. 9 mata los deseos de cada individuo de poder mejorar su situacion. No es verdad que no exist e la necesidad de aprobarla esta primera parte, puesto que si hay temor de que puedan obtener grandes extensiones de terreno, la segunda parte la puede remediar en el sentido de que el gobierno puede despues expropiar estos terrenos y venderlos despues a los particulares en pedazos pequeños.


SR. MONTINOLA. Pero es que estamos ahora tratando de la primera parte.


SR. RAFOLS. Por eso digo, si dejamos de aprobar la primera parte del Art. 9, se podra evitar la adquisicion de grandes extensiones de propiedades ocupadas por muchas personas mediante la expropiacion por el gobierno subdividiendolos en parcelas pequeñas, porque la primera parte dice que la Legislatura Nacionalpodra determinar por ley la extension de terreno agricola privado que en adelante podra adquirir cualquier individuo, corporacion o asociacion y podra autorizar la expropiacion de terrenos y disponer la subdivision de los mismos en pequnos lotes para traspasarlos a los particulares a precio de cosro, de tal manera que si uno ha heredado de sus padre s cincuenta mil hectareas de terreno, el gobierno puede expropiarlos y dividirlos entre los terratenientes.


SR. YSIP. Sr. Presidente, para una cuestion, de orden Parece que el Delegado por Iloilo ya ha expuesto todas sus ideas sobre el particular y pido ...


SR. MONTINOLA. Voy a terminar Caballeros. Este precepto quiza inadvertidamente, por su aprobacion, habeis dado un 
issue
 a los comunistas, porque con este 
draft
 en la mano un candidate comunista puede presentarse al electorado y decir: Caballeros aqui estoy, elegidme como representante, porque cuando yo sea representante dictaremos una ley limitado las propiedadesa encuenta hectareas y lo demas lo Venderemos a un peso por hectarea a vosotros. Esto no semi cierto para una conciencia honrada porque el precio de costo no es un peso por hectareas pero cuando se dice esto ante el electorado en la algidez de las campañas, quien no va a creer lo que dice el candidato sobre el particular? Este es el Peligro. Vosotros sols jovenes y yo ya soy viejo y no vere la aurora de la libertad; pero vosotros que sois jovenes todavia podeis ver que cada ano que pase ese numero de comunistas aumentara y quizas por ese 
issue
 conseguiran domina el Estado.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO (Sr. Cuenco). Ha terminado el tiempo del orador. 


SR. KAPUNAN. Sr. Presidente, pido el consentimiento unanime de la Asamblea para acceder la reconsideracion del Art. 4.


SR. CUADERNO. Me opongo.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO (Sr. Cuenco). Habiendo objecion presentada por el Caballero por Bataan, Sr. Cuaderno, no puede accederse a la peticion del Caballero por Leyte. Ademas, habiendo pasado mas de veinticuatro horas desde que se aprobo el precepto cue se trata de reconsiderar, la Mesa declara fuera de orden la mocion. Ademis, el asunto ha sido ya reconsideracion y la peticion ha sido desestimada. Los reglamentos prohiben que se reconsidere un asunto por dos veces.


SR. KAPUNAN. Parece que estamos en los ultimos dias de la Asamblea y tenemos derecho a pedir la suspension de los reglamentos.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. La Mesa desea saber si hay dos terceras partes que apoye la mocion del Caballero por Leyte. Los que esten conformes con la mocion del Caballero por Leyte, tengan la bonded de levantarse. (
Se levantas algunos Delegados
.) No habiendo dos terceras partes, se desestima la mocion.


SR. ORENSE. Sr. Presidente, para una mocion con respects al Art. 9. Voy a cambiar mi voto.


VARIOS DELEGADOS. No, no.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. La Mesa declara que no puede hacerse esa proposicion y esta fuera de orden. Habiendose anunciado el resultado de la votacion, ningun voto puede cambiarse.


SR. ORENSE. Para fines de reconsideracion solamente. Tenemos precedentes aqui y yo invoco esos precedentes para cambiar mi voto.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. La Mesa ya ha declarado fuera de orden esa peticion.


SR. MONTINOLA. Pido la reconsideracion del Art. 9.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El caballero por Iloilo vote en contra de la supresion y por ese motivo no puede pedir la reconsideracion.


SR. LOPEZ. Sr. Presidente, ayer vote a favor de la supresion y consta eso en el 
record
 y pido ahora la reconsideracion de la primero parte del Art. 9.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Esta en orden la mocion presentada por el Delegado por Batangas, Sr. Lopez. Tiene la palabra el Caballero por Batangas, Sr. Orense.


SR. ORENSE. Sr. Presidente y Caballeros de la Convencion: Yo no vengo francamente preparado para pro-nunciar un discurso elocuente como los que han pronunciado los defensores del 
draft
. Pero despues de haber oido al Caballero por Iloilo, demostrando aqui que esa primera parte del Art. 9 debe suprimirse,me he atrevido a aceptar la donacion de la palabra que me ha hecho mi colega. Caballeros, lo que se trata o el verdadero proposito o como diriamos ahora hablando constitucion almente, la filosofia de la primera parte del Art. 9 consiste en evitar la existencia de grandes latifundios en nuestro pais y evitar de este modo la concentracion de grandes propiedades en manos de unos cuantos. Quiero decirles ahora que este temor a peligro es infundado. No existen actualmente grandes latifundios en manos de unas cuantos personas en nuestro pais. Los grandes latifundios existen en manos del estado porque tenemos muchos terrenos publicos. Pero terrenos privados son unas cuantos haciendas que no pasaran de 3 o 4 en manos de unos cuantos. Con respecto a algunas propiedades yo se positivamente que ya se ha acordado la venta en parcelas. Los han subdividido pero es el caso que nuestros paisanos no tienen dinero para ir pagando esos lotes y comprarlos. La mejor prueba, senores, es que he sido por seis meses copropietario de una gran hacienda alrededor de Manila, de San Juan del Monte. Voy a decirles ahora el caso. He tenido que vender, Caballeros esta hacienda, y cuando yo trataba de venderla he procurado encontrar capital filipino, porque mi deseo era traspasarlo a manos filipinas pero cual fue mi desengano cuando no puede encontrar capital filipino sino capital americano y son esos que venden ahora la San Juan Heights y que estan ganando bastante dinero.


Tenemos otra hacienda grande, la hacienda de Mandaluyong 
Estate
 que se ha vendido a un filipino y a un americano. Esa hacienda que tiene ocho mil hectareas, esta ahora subdividida y requetesubdividida. La Hacienda de San Pedro Makati al rededor de Manila, la misma esta dividida y subdividida. Que hacienda, pues, queda por venderse? 


SR. CONFESOR. Para una pregunta al orador.


SR. ORENSE. Yo quisiera que me dejen primera en paz, y ya le contestare despues.


Entre los casos pricticos que aqui se han planteado y ha vuelto el orador por Iloilo a mencionar de un propietario, esta el de un propietario de una extension grande de terreno agricola, en el caso de que la Legislatura acordara o limitara una extension menor y no tuviera mas que uno o dos hijos a quienes dejar, como quedaria el exceso? Se ha sugerido que el gobierno podria expropiar para luego revenderlo. Caballeros, si este es el proposito de ir embarcando a nuestro gobierno en la empress de compra de propiedades privadas para luego revenderlas en lotes pequenos, va a Ilegar el dia en que este gobierno iria necesariamente a la bancarrota, sobre todo durante el ano o el periods de la mancomunidad y durante nuestra independencia en que con seguridad nuestros recursos economicos por lo mismo que somos un pueblo naciente, tienen que decrecer, de donde saldra tanto dinero para pagar nuestras propiedades? De donde saldra? dirian que el gobierno emitira bonos, pero un pueblo naciente no tan facilmente encontrara mercado para colocar sus bonos y yo no quisiera que este gobierno que tenemos, que tiene, un credito puede decirse internacional ahora, Ilegue a perder ese credito y a convertirseen un gobierno de 
balasubas
, porque eso seria la situacion. Si no hay dinero para afrontar las obligaciones, que pasara a ese gobierno o a un particular, que por ambicioso y por querer gastar mas de lo que tiene, no puede pagar sus compromisos? Eso seria exactamente la situacion. Quiero referirme a la compra que hizo el gobierno en los primeros alios de occupacion americana de todas las haciendas de las corporaciones religiosas. El gobierno para hacerse cargo de esta empresa ha tenido que emitir bonos por muchos millones bonos al tres y medio y al cuatro por ciento. Creo que estos bonos hasta ahora no estan totalmente redimidos y los terrenos estan ya vendidos todos pero no han pagade todos los que han comprado. Me consta, por propio conocimiento personal y no por referencias, porque algunas deudores de Calamba que no han podido hasta ahora pagar al gobierno sus deudas ni tampoco a nosotros que hemos tenido que aceptar, aunque siquiera una hipoteca menos eficaz porque no hay Titulo Torrens hasta ahora, por no haber podido pagar al gobierno el importante de sus terrenos. Senores: que quiere decir esta? El dia de mañana si tenemos que embarcar al gobierno, este se va a encontrar con que no tan facilmente podria reintegrarse del dinero invertido. Han pasado treinta y tantos afios desde que el gobierno ha revendido esas propiedades, y sin embargo, ha sido acaso reintegrado el gobierno, del dinero que invirtio hasta ahora? No, antes al contrario; el gobierno esta pagando intereses sobre los bonos aun no redimidos. Ademas, existe el siguiente peligro todavia; y yo me baso en hechos consumados: en esta venta de los terrenos de las haciendas de los frailes en que he intervenido como uno de los abogados del gobierno he notado que el pobre aparcero con cuyo sudor ha desmontado los bosques y los ha convertido en terrenos provechosos, no es el que ha solido beneficiado: es el cacique que el pueblo que por tener dinero es el primero que ha podido comprar. Pues otro tanto va a ocurrir si el dia de mañana la Legislatura decretara que las mil, dos mil o cuatro mil hectareas o lo que pase de 500 hectareas se vendan en lotes pequeños y si no tienen dinero para anticipar a ese gobierno, seria lo mismo que sera unos cuantos los que saldrian beneficiados y el cabapesino que gasta pantalones cortos y sombrero de 
salakot
 con carabao y arado, ese no sera beneficiado. Seguira siendo explotado por el cacique del pueblo. Hemos venido aqui no solamente para defender los intereses de los grandes sino tambien los de los pequenos, y por lo tanto debemos tratarles con igualdad como hemos enunciado y consignado en el 
bill of rights
. Igualdad ante la ley, igualdad entre pobres y ricos entre poderosos y debiles. 


Caballeros: os ruego que reconsideremos y no demos este paso, porque podria Ilegar el dia en que esta Asamblea, como dijo muy bien el caballero por Iloilo, cuando deje de existir y se erija a nuestros representantes a la Asamblea Constituyente y estos vayan a ocupar asiento alli, hubiere una mayoria que se defienda ante el electorado diciendo que se van a repartir las tierras que excedan del numero limitado. Caballeros, la palabra ""repartir"" es muy sugestiva y por eso, yo quisiera que meditemos y reconsideremos el Articulo 9 en su primera parte.


Estoy ahora dispuesto a contestar preguntas de los companeros.


EL PRESIDENTE. El tiempo de Su Senoria ha expirado, y el Delegado por Cebu, Sr. Sotto (F.) tiene la palabra.


SR. SOTTO (F.). Señor Presidente: Que hay, caballeros de la Convencion en el fondo de esta cuestion al parcer inocente y ordinaria para que tanto revuelo haya metido, tanto en la sesion de ayer como en la de hoy? Qui hay de misterioso en el fondo de este problema, para que politicos del volumen del caballero por Iloilo y del caballero por Batangas tomen con gran interes una mocion para reconsiderar lo acordado ayer? Voy a ser frio, senores. Parece que estas cuestiones es mejor tratarlas con calma y no con apasionamiento. He prestado atencion como siempre suelo hacer a todos los argumentos aducidos aqui en contra del precepto contenido en el 
draft
 y a favor ahora de la reconsideracion y siento decir lo siguiente: todos son argumentos muy buenos a
 posteriori
. Cuando la Asamblea Nacional se haya reunido, sera la ocasion de ver si o no procede expropiar terrenos o latifundios existentes ahora o existentes despues. En el presents yo me limito a invitar la atencion de la Convencion al hecho de que el precepto no hace otra cosa mis que autorizar a la Asamblea Nacional a que tome las medidas necesarias en tiempo oportuno cuando el problema del latifundismo se haya presentado con caracteres tales que el bienestar, interes y orden publicos lo requieran. Permitame la Convencion que le discuta en globo las dos partes del Articulo 9; hay tal engranaje en log dos mandatos que tiene dicho precepto, hay tal eslabon en una u otra parte que es imposible, que es diffcil que quitaramos deslindes si nos limitasemos a considerar una sola parte. La. primera parte autoriza a la Legislatura para fijar el limite maximo de propiedad agricola que los ciudadanos particulares puedan tener. Parece que es un punto que ha pasado desapercebido. No se trata aqui ahora de propiedades urbanas, sino de propiedades agricolas, y es por la razon de que con mucha especialidad es en las regiones agricolas, en las zonas rusticas es donde el latifundismo se extiende con facilidad, y desde alli los tentilculos de los caciques van al cuello de los pobres y de los pequenos propietarios precisamente para ahogarles y para inutiliazarles. Esta, pues, a salvo completamente la cuestion de las propiedades urbanas. Ciertos grandes solares de nuestras ciudades, su pretexts de tener ciertos edificios, que en realidad no necesitan de tales extensos solares para su existencia ni para su mantenimiento pueden dormir tranquilos. No vamos contra esas propiedades. Por una causa o por otra el pasado nos ha legado ese lastre doloroso. Pero la region agricola, la region menos explotada por nuestro pueblo, la region que necesitamos si queremos vivir por cuenta propia, la region que es el mayor incentive no solo para los grandes capitalistas de fuera sino tambien para los grandes capitalistas interiores, esa region merece todos los ciudados del gobierno.


Voy a pasar ahora a la relacion que tiene la segunda parte de la enmienda con la primera. Una vez demostrado ante la Legislatura, una vez convencida la Asamblea a National de que existe un latifundismo y que este latifundismo puede producir males o esta produciendo danos a la comunidad, es cuando entonces la Legislatura puede acordar la expropiacion de los latifundios. Donde esta el mal que los opositores a este precepto pretenden ver inutilmente? Prever es gobernar. Este es un postalado que todos lo conocen. Bien. Voy a admitir para los propositos del argumento que hoy no existen latifundios, y si los opositores al precepto quieren mas, vamos a convenir que no existiran en el futuro. Pues, entonoes, donde esta el temor que el hijo de tal no puede recibir la herencia de cual? El ejemplo repetidas veces presentado ayer y hoy en cuanto al heredero y al causante no es completamente exacto. Vamos a suponer que efectivamente un padre de familia posee un numero tal de hectareas de terreno, superior o excedente a lo que fija la ley. Creen los caballeros, creen los opositores al precepto que la Legislature, la Asamblea Nacional va a ser tan imprudente, tan loca que inmediatamente disponga por ley que aquella porcion excedente del terreno que ha de recibir un hijo de su padre no podra poseerlo no podra tenerlo o recibireo el heredero?


Esa es una materia para la Asamblea Nacional. La Asamblea Nacional sabe que no puede dictar leyes o medidas imposibles de cumplir. Fijari el plazo, fijari la proposicion de acuerdo con las circunstancias del tiempo entonces en que vivamos. Es posible que ahora un numero determinado de hectareas sea excesivo es posible que por desenvolvimiento economicos del pais ese numero de hectareas pueda ser elevado o reducido. Es por esto, el porque, el Comite precisamente no ha querido fijar desde ahora el numero de hectareas, prefiriendo dejar a la sabiduria, a la prudencia, al patriotismo y a la justicia de la Asamblea Nacional el friar ese numero.


Lo mismo digo de la expropiacion. Se habla de que el gobierno no tendra dinero; se habla de que no podra revender las propiedades. Pero, caballeros de la Convencion, caballeros opositores al precepto: si la Legislatura, si la Asamblea Nacional estuviera convencida de que el gobierno no puede hacer una expropiacion, va a hacerlo? La Asamblea Nacional dictara una ley autorizando la expropiacion de tal o cual latifundio cuando esto convencida, primero, de que la existencia de ese latifundio es amenazante para el bienestar publico: y, segundo, cuando la Asamblea Nacional este convencida de que el gobierno esta en disposicion para disponer la expropiacion.


Visto, puesto, desde este punto el asunto, no es malo autorizar fijar los limites, ni muchos menos es malo autorizar a la Legislatura para dictor leyes de expropiacion.


Pero voy a molestares por un minuto mas. Se ha mentado aqui con algun exito esta mañana — y digo con exito porque he oido algunos aplayos — se ha mentado la posibilidad de que los comunistas hagan un 
issue
 de esta disposicion que existe en el 
draft
; podran los comunistas pedir los votos del electorado para ser ellos los que dicten las leyes fijando el limite del terreno y ordenen la expropiacion. Que argumento mas bonito si tuviera base? Lo mas natural, creo yo, es que el pueblo, el electorado, al ver que es una Asamblea Constituyente comunista la que ha puesto esta disposicion, otorgue sus votos a esta misma Asamblea Nacional o a esos candidatos no comunistas. Quien esta en disposicion de terminar mejor una obra, aquel que ha trazado y puesto los Primeros pilares, o aquel que viene de gorra al final de la obra para decir; ""Aqui estoy para poner el tejado""?


Es sensible, sin embalgo, que una cuestion de importancia tan nacional como esta, pretendamos ligarla a los votos de los comunistas. El comunismo no ha de venir, porque nosotros fijimos los limites de terreno; no ha de venir porque prohibamos los latifundios mediante expropiacion forzosa, no; ha de venir precisamente por causa de los grandes propietarios de terreno, y ha de venir, queramoslo o no, porque el mundo esta evolucionando y se va a convencer de que la vida no es solamente para unos cuantos sino para todos, porque Dios nos la dio, la libertad, el aire, la luz, la tierra para vivir (
Grandes aplausos
), y por algo se ha dicho que en los comienzos de la vida humana debio haber sido fusilado, matado, a aquel primera que puso un cerco a un pedazo de tierra reclamando ser suya la propiedad. .Por estas razones, senor Presidente, y sintiendo que mi tiempo esta para terminar, voy a dar fin a mi discurso agradeciendo a la Convencion.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Ha expirado el tiempo del orador.


MR. LOPEZ (E.). Mr. President.


The PRESIDENT. The gentleman from Negros Oriental has the floor.


MR. LOPEZ (E.). Mr. President, and gentlemen of the Convention. Last night when this question was put to a vote, I voted in favor of retaining the provisions of the draft. I am a socialist, but I am not a socialist of the Maxwell Type. I believe in individualism, gentlemen of the Convention. I was very much impressed by the last part of the Speech of Delegate Montinola. Japan and China and many other countries today are spending millions of pesos and sacrificing thousands of lives to preserve the institution of individualism which has developed and made the world the great world that it is today. The great American continent was developed through the initiative of the great American individualists who made the great country that it is today. I very much fear that by the insertion to the Constitution of this precept, we might kill that individual initiative which has made our progress. Gentlemen of the Convention, there is enough land in the Philippines today for every Filipino citizen in this country and for every Filipino citizen for the next two generations to come. There is no fear in my mind that a great free landholdings in the Philippines will endanger the social structure that we are trying to build in this country. We can learn lessons from the experiences of the great American nation. In the beginning of the history of America, the Americans were individualists — great individualists; but modern progress brought out the American nation changing its form of government and introducing the means which kill the ambition of the individualists. They have developed the theory and principle of the great police power of the State. Judicial statemanship has developed the power to an extent that now the state — the central government in the United States is practically so great that no individual or group of individuals can challenge that power of the ment to promote the welfare, the progress and the prosperity of the whole nation. Through the development of the principle of police power of the state, it is now the established doctrine in the United States that private property is held in trust for the benefit of the community. They have done that without any amendment of the Constitution. They have tried to bend the rigid principles of that Constitution to accomodate its provisions to the needs of the times. No laws, no amendment to that Constitution has been done. It was done because the American people not only in individualism; the great American nation also believe that the government must have the power and right to promote the progress, the prosperity and the happiness of the American people. Gentlemen of the Convention, there is one thing we must consider. If we approve this provision in the draft I very much fear that this country would not be able to enter into the open competition with the other neighboring countries in the open markets of the world. There is a reason for giving the individual full play in the management of the property There is reason for giving the individual full play in the development of his powers. We are not going to pull that down. We should follow that in order that the individuals would have to promote their lives. The principle that we should follow is for the great to pull up the less energetic and make this nation really energetic that we should be. Gentlemen of the Convention, we are laying down the foundation for the future. We need all our patience, all of our intelligence, all of our statesmanship in the task. We should not be radicals. We should, and I think we must, give full play to the development of individualism in this country, and therefore I favor, and I hope that you also favor the reconsideration of this question.


THE PRESIDENT. The time of the gentleman has expired.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El tiempo del orador ha expirado. Ahora tiene la palabra el Delegado por Negros Occidental, Sr. Locsin.


SR. ROXAS. Señor Presidente: Antes de comezar en el uso de la palabra el Delegado por Negros Occidental, quisiera dirigirle una pregunta, y creo que el caballero por Negros Occidental gustosamente accede a mi peticion.


Bajo esta disposicion quedaran afectados los propietarios que hoy poseen grandes extensiones de terreno, es decir, es la interpretacion del Comite de que la Legislatura no podra limitar las propiedades de modo que afecten a los actuates poseedores?


SR. LOCSIN. Contestare al caballero por Capiz diciendo que hay esta disposicion o esta frase: 
May hereafter
.


SR. ROXAS. De modo que estas palabras 
may hereafter
 es para proteges derechos adquiridos? Creo que no es muy clara la disposicion, pero el Comite de Estilo puede aclararla mas tarde.


SR. BRIONES. Señor Presidente: En este punto de la cuestion, como se recordara, yo suscite algunas dudas sobre la interpretacion de este precepto en la sesion de anoche; las mismas dudas que ha suscitado aqui, el Delegado, por Capiz. Con la explicacion dada aqui por el Presidente del Comite de Recursos Naturales, que fue el que esbozo este precepto, yo me doy por enteramente satisfecho, y me alegro que esas dudas hayan sido disipadas satisfactoriamente, y quisiera pedir al Delegado por Negros Occidental que me reserve unos cuantos minutos de su tiempo para hablar en contra de la mocion de reconsideracion.


DISCURSO DEL SR. LOCSIN


SR. LOCSIN. Señor Presidente y Caballeros de la Convencion: Estaba procurandome una representacion grafica de la filosofia del articulo hoy en discussion. Creo haberla hallado. El delegado por Batangas Sr. Orense, que lo impugna, es de una corpulencia notable, que su baja estatura mas lo abulta. Este vuestro servidor, tiene pocas carnes y es bien alto. Una reservada facultad, para crear de entre los dos Sr. Orense, el tipa medio, de la ponderacion estetica del fisico de nuestro Presidente, Sr. Recto, es sencillamente un logro. El ejercito de esa facultad, sera para buscar el equilibrio entre todos los detalles, que exaltaria la belleza armonica del conjunto. Pues bien, esa es la naturaleza de la facultad que se confiere a la Asamblea Nacional en virtud de este articulo. Es un atributo mas de soberania, para que en un determinado momento, puede el gobierno marcar su utilidad directriz y reguladora de la sociedad.


Nuestro Vice Presidente, el delegado Sr. Montinola, senalo que este articulo, facilitaria la implantacion del decomunismo en el pais. Si no ando equivocado, la negacion de la propiedad privada, es un principio basico del comunismo. La facultad del Estado de regular la propiedad privado, pre-establece el reconocimiento de la mismo de la propiedad privada. El articulo presidente al que hoy estamos considerando, establece terminantemente la propiedad privada. Por lo tanto, definitivamente, por el tiempo en que esta Constitution que estamos redactando, sea la Magna Carta del pais, el comunismo queda descartado.


El delegado Sr. Lopez, por Batangas, ha ponderado el individualisms. Anotaremos que en la estructuracion contemporanea del gobierno y de la vida americana, el individuo esta cediendo su puesto a la organizacion. Cuanto mas compleja es la vida y mas grande y nutrido es el bazar de hombres y de cosas la interdependencia se hace mas fuerte y trabazonada. El individuo se hace gobernar, y este, quiere decir simplemente, que renuncia parte de sus prerogatives individuales en interes de las necesidades de una comunidad social ordenada.


El articulo, respeta los derechos adquiridos. La sucesion hereditaria que se encarque de sub-dividir la propiedad grande ya formado. Pero establece la facultad del Estado de regular la propiedad privada por formarse. El objeto principal de este articulo, es para que el Estado pueda vincular a la tierra el mayor numero de propietarios economicamente independientes. La experiencia de muchas naciones, nos revels que la democracia agraria de Jefferson, desarrollada plenamente es una garantia de estabilidad y prosperidad nacionales.


No se Ilegara a drasticas limitaciones de la propiedad privada. Esta tiene que estar al margen de una politica de atomizacion de la propiedad. El cuerpo ya consagrado de nuestra Constitution asi lo garantiza. Hemos estatuido que el Estado podra, de los terrenos agricolas publicos, vender a un individuo hasta 144 hectareas, y a una corporacion 1024 hectareas. Por consecuencia la Asamblea Nacional, cuando quiera friar la extension de la propiedad privada, no podra bajar de estos limites. Sostenemos que esta facultad, no puede matar la iniciativa privada. La agricultura cientifica, ofrece un campo virgen aun, para la acometividad de los agricultores del pais, si quieren duplicar su produccion en una determinada unidad de terreno. La associacion entre propieptarios, la confederacion de sus propiedades, daria lugar a una vasta extension, que debidamente explotada, llenaria la necesidad de las empresas millonarias. Tenemos el ejemplo de las Centrales Azucareras, que sin ser duenas de terrenos, crearon verdaderos distritos de produccion del azucar, mediante la confederacion de propiedades, contiguas unas de otras.


Esos que combaten tanto el intervencionismo gubernamental, hace observar un miembro del Gabinete del Presidente Roosevelt, en momentos de crisis, son los primeros en urgiria. Senalo que los aceiteros de los Estados Unidos hicieron fuertes representaciones cerca del gobierno para que este re encargara de sus negocios. Aqui en Filipinas, cuando surgen conflictos industriales o agrarios la reaccion primera del dueno de la fabrica o del hacendero, es pedir la proteccion armada del gobierno. Si esto es verdad, por que esta resistencia contra una facultad mas para el Estado, que ha de ampliar su utilidad ordenadora de la vida social?


Señor Presidente y Caballeros de la Convencion; somos del pueblo y Estamos en esta del pueblo, para formalizar la solemnidad liturgica de los esponsales de la nacion y la libertad. La mujer que se hace madre, exalta sus nuevas responsabilidades, haciendo un acopio de facultades constructives, para formar hijos sanos, dignos y felices. Si queremos rendir la excelsitud de nuestro amor a la nacion filipina, que se apresta a la nueva vida, rodeemosla de atributos que la capaciten para hacer de todos los filipinos, ciudadanos libres, y contentos de la vida.


Por todas estas consideraciones, yo os pido, que voteis contra la mocion de reconsideracion.


SR. ENRIQUEZ. Sr. Presidente para una pregunta.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Ya ha expirado el tiempo del orador.


SR. ENRIQUEZ. Es una pregunta important que el Presidente del Comite de Nacionalizacion puede contestar. .SR. LOCSIN. Bueno, voy a contestar.


SR. ENRIQUEZ. El Presidente del Comite de Ponencia el Sr. Sotto, a quien yo admiro ha afirmado el otro dia en su discurso aqui que el Art. 9 se refiere a latifundios que puede el gobierno expropiarlos y luego revenderlos a los terratenientes. Pero yo entiendo a S.S. que si bien esa interpretacion es corrects en partly y en parte no, porque la fraseologia del Art. 9 no distingue sobre la clase de latifundios, habla solamente de que el gobierno Puede expropiar terrenos ... .


SR. LOCSIN. En cuanto Ileguemos a la segunda parte y si hay tiempo tendre la satisfaccion de explicar a toda la Asamblea el alcance de este articulo.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Tiene la palabra el Delegado por Cebu, Sr. Briones.


SR. BRIONES. Sr. Presidente, Caballeros de la Convencion: Si ha habido alguna parte de la Constitution sobre la cual ... 


SR. ORENSE Sr. Presidente, para una question de orden. Parece que se han registrado turnos en pro y en contra y creo ... 


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. El Delegado por Negros Occidental cedio parte de su tiempo al Delegado por Cebu. El Delegado por Cebu no tiene mas que cinco minutos que es parte del tiempo del Delegado por Negres Occidental.


EL PRESIDENTE INTERINO. Puede continuar el Delegado por Cebu.


SR. BRIONES. Si Presidente, como yo decia si hay alguna parte de la Constitution sobre la cual yo haya meditado por mis tiempo y mas seriamente, ese es el precepto que hoy estamos debatiendo, y no era para mencionar, Sr. Presidente, porque parece que esta parte de la Constitucion puede dar la impression, como ya se ha insinuado en algunos sectores de esta Asamblea, de que esta parte de la Constitution viene a atacar el principio fundamental de la propiedad privada. Sr. Presidente, despuss de meditar sobre los alcances, el peso de esta parte del precepto, yo he llegado a la conclusion de que no existe aqui ningun atentado contra la propiedad privada, como se insinuo anoche por el distinguido delegado por Cavite, Sr. Francisco. Se reconoce precismente en este precepto el principio fundamental de la propiedad privida. Todo lo que hacemos es regular la propiedad privada y esto entra perfectamente dentro de los poderes, dentro de las facultades del Estado.


TEEHANKEE, 
J, 
concurrinng and dissenting:


I concur in the result of the main opinion, insofar as it reverses the decision of the lower Court which granted petitioner-appellees petition for a writ of prohibition and permanently enjoined respondents-appellees from instituting the proceedings for the expropriation of the ""Tatalon Estate"" as specifically authorized by Republic Act No. 2616. 


The result is that respondents may now properly file the corresponding expropriation proceedings for the expropriation of the ""Tatalon Estate"". It will be recalled that in 1961, the Court in G.R. No. L-18128 upheld the preliminary injunction issued by the lower Court enjoining the filing of such expropriation proceedings, until decision of the prohibition case on the merits.


From the various views expressed by the members of the Court during the deliberations on the case, I gather that our decision now does not foreclose petitioner from raising in the expropriation proceedings what it may deem as proper and valid objections and defenses to the action, including those it has advanced in the present case, just as respondents may therein adduce additional facts besides, those of record, in support of the petition to be filed by them.


To the extent that the main opinion tends to prematurely judge petitioner's objections and defenses, I reserve my vote. I do not believe that all the relevant facts and circumstances are properly and adequately before the Court to enable it to rule on them now.


For purposes of this separate opinion, it shall suffice to list the principal issues which should properly be resolved, in my estimation, in the expropriation proceedings yet to be instituted.


1.	To begin with, the question of what remains of the ""Tatalon Estate"" that may be subjected to expropriation proceedings has to be threshed out. The Solicitor General speculates in his memorandum (at page 12) that the lower Court's finding of fact that ""only 11.68% of the Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision remained unsold"" is ""deceptive"", because ""the remaining 11.68% could all be inside the Tatalon Estate."" On the other hand, petitioner asserts categorically in its memorandum (at page 9) that ""As a matter of fact, as of February 17, 1969, of the original area of about 109 hectares, 411,968.80 square meters had already been sold. Considering that 50,612.30 square meters are reserved for public parks, 3,724.20 square meters for alleys, and 241,989.50 square meters for streets, only 388,989.50 square meters, or less than 39 hectares, remain unsold.""


2.	Similarly, the question of whether there remain ""
bona fide
"" occupants on the property, who are the express beneficiaries of Republic Act 2616 or whether such occupants are merely illegal squatters and occupants as found by the lower court in its decision and asserted by petitioner is one of sharp conflict.


3.	All these factual questions should first be determined, before the vital issues of necessity of the taking and whether it is for the public use, may be resolved. I do, not think that the re-examination of the Baylosis case can properly be undertaken now without the relevant facts before us. Whatever facts these are, as found by the lower court, appear to be adverse to respondents, but respondents shall have another opportunity at the expropriation proceedings to establish the necessary facts which could bring the questioned Act within confines of constitutional limits.


4.	For the main opinion quotes with favor from Justice Tuason in the leading Guido case that ""no fixed line of demarcation between what taking is for public use and what is not can be made; each case has to be judged according to its peculiar circumstances"" and that, ""the assertion of the right on the part of the legislature to take the property of one citizen and transfer it to another, even for a full compensation, when the public interest is not promoted thereby, is claiming a despotic power, and one inconsistent with every just principle and fundamental maxim of a free government."" I share the view in the dissenting opinion of Justice J.B.L. Reyes that the constitutional provision is not necessarily limited to landed estates. (Article XIII, section 4). But that case clearly involved agrarian discontent and with the pertinent facts yet to be established, I am not prepared to say that it is 
in pari materia
 with the case at bar. We must first have the peculiar facts and circumstances governing the case at bar, before we can judge it.
1


5.	Neither do I agree with the observation that the constitutional power of Congress for the expropriation of lands is well-nigh all embracing and forecloses the courts from inquiring into the necessity for the taking of the property. It is noted that this is the first case where Congress has singled out a particular property for condemnation under the constitutional power conferred upon it. Does this square with the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution? Is the explanatory note of the bill later enacted as Republic Act 2616, without any evidence as to a hearing with the affected parties having been given the opportunity to be heard, and citing merely the population increase of Quezon City and the land-for-the-landless program sufficient compliance with these basic constitutional guarantees? Rather, does not the need for a more serious scrutiny as to the power of Congress to single out a particular piece of property for expropriation, acknowledged in the main opinion, call for judicial scrutiny, with all the facts in, as to the need for the expropriation for full opportunity to dispute the legislative appraisal of the matter? And who should bear the burden of demonstrating that the equal protection guarantee had been observed, the State or the owner whose property has been singled out? 


6.	Pertinent to note with reference to these questions is the guideline in the Guido case that ""the size of the land expropriated, the large number of people benefited, and the extent of social and economic reform secured by the condemnation, clothes the expropriation with public interest and public use"", and the Courts admonition in the subsequent Arellano Law College case that where such limitations and conditions governing the need of taking property for public use are not present, ""the National Government may not confer upon its instrumentalities authority (to expropriate) which it itself may not exercise."" This would indicate precisely that where Congress itself directly exercised the power to expropriate and singles out a specific property under the Act, rather than have the Executive agencies institute the corresponding expropriation proceeding under the general laws it has enacted in pursuance of its constitutional power, the question of its appraisal of the necessity and of the validity of its exercise of the authority to expropriate the specific property is not foreclosed from judicial scrutiny.


7.	Finally, the main opinion acknowledges that existing contractual rights that have been acquired by vendor and purchasers of subdivided lots of the property shall be accorded the appropriate constitutional protection of non-impairment, at the expropriation proceedings. Importantly related to this unassailable dictum are questions not founded on primacy of property rights concepts or personal predilections or private notions of policy. These concern the fact that the Tatalon Estate has been subdivided into lots for sale to the public, with priority after the passage of Republic Act No. 2616 to the occupants (and such purchasers may have been theretofore landless themselves), and the Court's reason in dismissing the action for condemnation in the analogous Urban Estates. Inc. case that ""the people on whose behalf this action has been instituted could acquire the remaining lots by direct purchase from the defendant like those (direct) purchasers.""
2
 In view of the cardinal principle of eminent domain that just compensation of the market value of the land must be paid as well as of the constitutional limitation that the land be conveyed at cost to the individuals concerned, respondents may well consider that the objectives of the Act may be accomplished more expeditiously by a direct purchase of the available unsold lots for resale at cost to the remaining 
bona fide
 occupants in accordance with the Act's provisions or by extending financial assistance to enable them to purchase directly the unsold lots from petitioner. I do not see anything to be gained by respondents from the institution of expropriation proceedings, when petitioner-owner is actually selling the property in subdivided lots.

6	Sec. 1.	Republic Act No. 2616. The two succeeding sections follow: ""Sec. 2. Immediately upon the appropriation of funds by the Congress of the Philippines for the payment of just compensation for the said Tatalon Estate, the Solicitor General, or any other proper Government authority shall institute the necessary expropriation proceedings before the Court of First Instance of Quezon City. Sec. 3. After the expropriation of the Tatalon Estate as provided in this Act, the lots therein shall be sold at cost to their present 
bona fide
 occupants in not more than two hundred forty equal monthly installments with interest of not more than six
 per centum per annum
 on the unpaid balance."" The fourth section was thereafter amended by Republic Act No. 3453 to read thus: ""Sec. 4. Upon approval of this amendatory Act, no ejectment proceedings shall be instituted or prosecuted against the present occupants of any lot in said Tatalon Estate, and no ejectment proceedings already commenced shall be continued, and such lot or any portion thereof shall not be sold by the owners of said estate to any person other than the present occupant without the consent of the latter given in a public instrument."" It was held in Cuatico v. Court of Appeals: ""It is, therefore, imperative that we declare, as we now do, that Section 4 of Republic Act No. 3453 which prohibits the filing of an ejectment proceeding, or the continuance of one that has already been commenced, even in the absence of expropriation proceedings offends our Constitution and, hence, is unenforceable.""
