MONTEMAYOR, 
J.
:


This is a petition to review on 
certiorari
 the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations of October 10, 1955 and the resolution of said court 
en banc
 of December 5, of the same year, denying the motion for reconsideration of the decision. Because of the view we take of the case, we deem it unnecessary to state the facts in detail.


The petitioner, Boy Scouts of the Philippines, a public corporation created under Commonwealth Act 111, is a civic and benevolent institution engaged in the promotion and development of the character, patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues in the boys of the country. Section 4 of the Act of creation states its objectives as ""solely of a benevolent character and not for pecuniary profit"". Respondent Juliana V. Araos worked with the petitioner as scout executive, holding such position and rank from 1948 up to her dismissal from the service on June 1, 1954. Respondent, during her incumbency, organized the BSP Employees Welfare Association, a sort of labor organization or union of employees working in the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. She became president thereof. On January 29, 1954, respondent filed charges with the National Bureau of Investigation against Exequiel Villacorta, Chief Scout Executive, for alleged ""anomalous actuations of the said person in the performance of his duties in the said office."" On February 1, 1954, respondent addressed a letter to the President of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, Jose B. Vargas, bringing to his attention the charges she had filed against Villacorta with the NBI. She also sent and distributed copies of her charges to each and every member of the Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, to the Presidential Complaint and Action Committee, Malacañang, and to the President of the Philippines, to scouters all over the Philippines, and to all the delegates to the 15th Annual Meeting, National Council, Boy Scouts of the Philippines. It is said that the NBI found Villacorta guilty of the charges filed by Araos.


Thereafter, H.B. Reyes, Chairman of the Personnel Committee of the BSP, on May 18, 1954, addressed a letter to respondent, which is self-explanatory, and which we quote below:




Dear Madam:


A report and complaint have been received by President Jorge B. Vargas, and the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, to the effect that you have engaged systematically in activities inimical to the best interests of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, with total disregard and in defiance of the duly-constituted authorities of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, consisting of the following acts:


a. That you have filed a complaint with a request for an immediate investigation of Mr. Exequiel Villacorta, Chief Scout Executive of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, with the President's Complaints and Action Commission (PCAC) directly, and with the National Bureau of Investigation, and have only furnished copy thereof to the President of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines.


b. That you have reproduced the same complaints and distributed copies thereof to various newspaper offices in the City of Manila, and sent copies thereof to various Scouters in the City of Manila and the provinces, notwithstanding that you knew that the complaints were under investigation by the Committee on Personnel of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines and the NBI.


c. That notwithstanding your knowledge and information that the Committee on Personnel has your complaints under consideration, and that the report of the NBI agent, in charge of the case, has not been submitted to nor received by the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, you have distributed copies of the same complaints to the delegates of the 15th National Council Meeting of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, and/or mailed copies, thereof to the delegates.


d. That immediately after the closing of the 15th National Council Meeting and upon learning that no delegates had taken up the subject matter of your complaints at the Council Meeting, you proceeded to see Mr. Rafael Yabut, the radio commentator, and furnished him copy of the same charges which were under investigation with the intention to have those charges aired over the radio, as in fact they were made the subject matter of Mr. Yabut's broadcast in the morning of May 12, 1954.


By instruction of the National Executive Board, you are hereby requested to submit your reply to the above specification of charges, and explain within 72 hours why disciplinary action should not be taken against you for your censurable conduct against the best interests of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines and in disregard and defiance of the duly-constituted authorities of the Organization.






Respectfully yours 

For the National Executive Board.


(Sgd.) H. B. REYES 

          
Chairman 

Personnel Committee








Respondent answered the letter, practically admitting the activities and acts imputed to her said to be inimical to the interests of the BSP, but trying to justify the same.


On May 26, 1954, the Personnel Committee of the BSP, composed of H.B. Reyes, Gabriel A. Daza, Enrique A. Lolarga, Sergio Bayan, F.E.V. Sison, Eugenio Padua, and Teodoro K. Molo, the latter reserving his vote, filed a report with the National Executive Board of the BSP. After discussing the merits of the case, the Committee came ""to the unanimous conclusion that Mrs. Juliana V. Araos is guilty as charged and that her present conduct, judged in the light of her past record, is such that her continuation in the service of the scouting movement in the Philippines is highly prejudicial to its interest and therefore, recommends that she be dismissed from the service effective immediately."" Presumably acting upon said report and recommendation, BSP President Vargas, on June 1, 1954, sent a letter to respondent dismissing her from the service of the BSP.


On August 3, 1954, respondent filed charges against the BSP in the Court of Industrial Relations for unfair labor practice, alleging that her dismissal was in violation of Section 4, Subsection (a), paragraphs 4 and 5 of Republic Act No. 875, claiming that she had been dismissed due to her union activities, in filing charges against the Chief Scout Executive. On September 28 1954, acting prosecutor Ilagan of the CIR filed a formal complaint in the case. On October 4, 1954, the BSP filed a motion to dismiss the case among other grounds that the CIR had no jurisdiction over the case for the reason that the BSP was a civic, charitable, humanitarian and patriotic enterprise, not created for profit and consequently, there could be no labor dispute over which the CIR may exercise jurisdiction. By the order of October 14, 1954, the CIR deferred action on the motion to dismiss, until trial, so that all questions of law and fact may be determined in a single decision. After hearing, Judge Jose S. Bautista, Acting Presiding Judge of the CIR, rendered decision on October 10, 1955, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:




IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the respondent is hereby ordered:


1. To cease and desist from dismissing any of the employees for having filed charges against it;


2. To reinstate Mrs. Juliana V. Araos to her former or equivalent position with back pay, without prejudice to all privileges accruing in her favor, from June 1, 1954 up to her reinstatement;


3. To post a copy of the dispositive portion of this decision in its bulletin board, the same to remain posted therein for thirty (30) days from the date of this decision becomes final and executory.




Acting upon a motion for reconsideration, Judge Bautista with Associate Judges V. Jimenez Yanson, and Arsenio I. Martinez, concurring, denied the motion for reconsideration, while Associate Judge Juan L. Lanting, took no part. As already stated, petitioner BSP is appealing from that decision and resolution.


We propose to decide the present case exclusively on the question of jurisdiction, regardless of the merits of the case.


Is the BSP an employer as contemplated by Republic Act No. 875, and was the controversy between it and the respondent a labor or industrial dispute cognizable by the Court of Industrial Relations?


In the case of U.S.T. Hospital Employees Association vs. Santo Tomas University Hospital, 95 Phil., 40, which involved the question of whether the employees of said hospital were entitled to extra compensation for working at night and whether the hospital was governed by the Eight Hour Labor Law, Commonwealth Act No. 444, this Court, through Mr. Justice Pablo, sustained the order of the Court of Industrial Relations dismissing the action filed by the U.S.T. Hospital Employees association, for lack of jurisdiction, and we held that inasmuch as the Santo Tomas University Hospital was not established for profit or gain, but on the contrary was organized for the elevated purpose of serving suffering humanity, the posts occupied by the employees and laborers of the hospital may not be considered as industrial employment, and that their controversy with the hospital regarding additional pay cannot be considered as an industrial dispute; consequently, the action filed by said laborers and employees was not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations.


The doctrine laid down in the hospital case above-mentioned was reiterated in the case of San Beda College vs. National Labor Union, et al., 97 Phil., 787, 51 Off. Gaz. 5636, where this Court, through Mr. Justice Sabino Padilla, held that inasmuch as the San Beda College was not operated and maintained for profit or for purpose of gain, the persons working in said college cannot be deemed to be industrial employees and consequently, any controversy or dispute they may have with the College in connection with or arising out of their employment does not come within the purview of Commonwealth Act 103, as amended by Commonwealth Act Nos. 254 and 559.


In the cases of Quezon Institute vs. Velasco, and Quezon Institute vs. Paraso, 97 Phil., 905, 51 Off. Gaz. (12) 6175, respectively, this Court, through Mr. Justice Jugo, held, citing the Santo Tomas University Hospital case (
supra
), that ""with greater reason the Quezon Institute should be declared as an institution not established for gain within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Law"", and reversed the orders of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner requiring the Quezon Institute to pay indemnities to two employees of said Institute who contracted tuberculosis due to their work there, were incapacitated for certain periods of time, and later filed claims with the Workmen's Compensation Commission.


Again, in the case of Baselides Marcelo, et al., vs. Philippine National Red Cross, 101 Phil., 544, where the employees of the Red Cross filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila, claiming overtime pay, including payment for services rendered on Sundays and holidays, and where the trial court, acting upon a motion to dismiss, dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action on the ground that the Eight Hour Labor Law, Commonwealth Act No. 444, did not apply to said employees of the Red Cross, this Court affirmed the order of dismissal, and through Mr. Justice Alfonso Felix, we said that the Philippine National Red Cross performs humanitarian work and is not engaged in an industry or occupation for purposes of gain, and consequently, its employees cannot demand as a matter of right the application to them of the Eight Hour Labor Law.


In the course of the discussion of this case, particularly, the aforementioned cases of the Santo Tomas Hospital, San Beda College, Quezon Institute, and Philippine National Red Cross, 
supra
, it was claimed that none of these cases is in point, for the reason that they do not touch upon or involve the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court. Strictly speaking, the claim is correct. However, these case cited not exactly to support the theory that the Industrial Court has no jurisdiction over the present case, but rather to show that this high Tribunal has laid down the doctrine that labor legislation, like Commonwealth Act 103, as amended, creating the Court of Industrial Relations, the Eight-Hour Labor Law and the Workmen's Compensation Act, have no application to institutions organized and operated for charity, education, etc., and not for profit or gain, as far as the relationship between the management and its employees or laborers is concerned; that despite the solicitude shown by the Legislature for labor and its policy to promote the welfare of the employees and laborers, nevertheless, it did not see fit or deem it necessary to extend to the workers in these charitable and educational organizations, the benefits of extra compensation for overtime work and work on Sundays and holidays, and for compensation for injuries suffered or illness contracted and aggravated, arising out of and in the course of employment; and that by analogy, the Industrial Peace Act, Republic Act 875, also a labor law, has no application to the Boy Scouts of the Philippines.


It was also asserted that our decisions in the cases of Metropolitan Water District Workers Union vs. Court of Industrial Relations, 91 Phil., 840, and Government Service Insurance System vs. Castillo, 98 Phil., 878, 52 Off. Gaz. (9) 4269, somewhat weaken and adversely affect our ruling in the Santo Tomas Hospital and San Beda College cases, for the reason that in the two cases involving the instrumentalities of the Government, neither engaged in the production of goods nor in seeking monetary gain, Metropolitan Water District having been established to render public service by furnishing an adequate water supply and sewerage service and the Government Service Insurance System, to promote the efficiency and welfare of the employees of the Philippine Government, still we held that the Industrial Court had jurisdiction under Commonwealth Act 103, as amended, to settle disputes between said entities and their employees. The seeming conflict in our rulings in the two sets of cases can readily be explained. In the first place, the Metropolitan Water District and the Government Service Insurance System are government corporations or entities engaged not in governmental functions, but rather in proprietary functions of the Government, and these entities are expressly not excluded from the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act, Republic Act 875, under Section 11 thereof, and that consequently, the policy of the Government against strikes for the purpose of securing changes or modifications in the terms and conditions for employment of employees in the Government, including the political subdivisions thereof, does not apply. In the second place, as regards the Metropolitan Water District it cannot be truly said that it does not seek monetary gain. For the water and sewerage service it renders, it charges compensation, sometimes at a rate which in the opinion of the consumers is above the value of said service, resulting in general complaints and petitions for reduction of rate. This profit or gain over the expenses incurred by the Metropolitan Water District is utilized to expand its facilities and resources, so that after many years, the property, resources and assets of the Metropolitan Water District will be far in excess and beyond its original capital or investment, and any time or when this entity is dissolved or its functions are taken over by a private entity, which is possible and legally permissible, and its assets are bought as an entity, there would be a sizeable, if not a tremendous gain for the Government. Besides, any increase in pay, extra compensation, monism, etc., which may be demanded by and granted its employees and laborers, if they cannot be taken from or absorbed by the income and profits, can easily be passed on to its customers by increasing its rates. Surely, the Metropolitan Water District can in no sense be considered a charitable, benevolent, or philanthropic institution. And as to the Government Service Insurance System, it is well known of government employees, in huge amounts and at substantial interest, and the profits made therefrom are in part are distributed as dividends among its insured. Surely, said insurance entity does not operate for charity, but in practice operates for profit or gain for the benefit of those insured by it. This, aside from the fact that insurance has been generally considered and even held by the courts to be a business.


Now, may the Boy Scout of the Philippines, which is admittedly organized and operated not for profit or gain, be considered as engaged in an industry so that its relation with its employees may be governed by the Industrial Peace Act, Republic Act No. 875, that the dismissal of one of its employees for alleged union activities may be considered as unfair labor practice, within the meaning of said Industrial Peace Act, and consequently, cognizable by the Court of Industrial Relations?


The main issue involved in the present case is whether or not a charitable institution or one organized not for profit but for more elevated purposes, charitable, humanitarian, etc., like the Boy Scout of the Philippines, is included in the definition ""employer"" contained in Republic Act 875, and whether the employees of said institution fall under the definition of ""employee"" and also contained in the same Republic Act. If they are included, then the act which may be considered unfair labor practice, within the meaning of said Republic Act, would come under the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations; but if they do not fall within the scope of said Republic Act, particularly, its definitions of employer and employee, then the Industrial Court would have no jurisdiction at all.


During the discussion of this case, it was claimed that our Industrial Peace Act is partly modelled after the National labor Relations Act, known as the Wagner Act; that said Wagner Act contains Similar definitions of ""employer"" and ""employee""; and that in a number of cases decided by the Federal courts, including the United States Supreme Court, interpreting and applying said Wagner Act, it has been consistently and uniformly held that non-profit organizations and charitable institutions fall within the scope of the term employer within the meaning of the Wagner Act, and on that consequently, if we are to follow said judicial authorities, we must perforce hold that a non-profit organization like the Boy Scouts of the Philippines comes within the scope of the definition of employer under our Industrial Peace Act, and so any unfair labor practice committed by the management of said institution would come within the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations. The point raised as quite important and deserves extended discussion and explanation.


For purposes of reference, we shall reproduce the definitions of ""employer"" and ""employee"" in the Wagner Act and the corresponding Act 875:
