MALCOLM, 
J.:


This is an action brought by the father to recover damages in the amount of P30,000 for the death of his son, alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant. The answer pleaded the general issue. The judgment in the Court of First Instance absolved the defendant from the complaint, without pronouncement as to costs. 


A succinct statement of the facts will be first undertaken as follows: On the afternoon of August 9, 1928, Moises Cuison, a boy 7 years of age, the son of the plaintiff, was on his way to the Santa Mesa School, in the City of Manila, in company with his sister Marciana. As they came near to the fire station, some large pieces of lumber on a truck which had stopped fell from it pinning the boy beneath, and causing his almost instant death. The truck in questioned was owned by Antonio Ora. It was driven by Felix Jose, with Telesforo Binoya as the 
washing
 and Francisco Bautista as the helper, the two latter being youths less than18 years of age. Jose Binoya, and Bautista were employees of Ora. The truck was rented by Ora to Norton & Harrison Co. On the truck were the letters ""N-H,"" which were the first letters of the firm name. Ora was in the employ of Norton & Harrison Co. as a 
capataz
. It was his duty as such employee to direct the loading and transportation of the lumber. When the accident occurred the lumber had become loosened, and it was to rearrange it that the truck halted, without, however, there arrangement having been made before the pieces of lumber had fallen and killed the boy. 


Important details were not brought out in the testimony, although it would have been easy to supply those details. The most important question of fact to determine was the relationship of Ora to Norton & Harrison Co., whether he was a servant of the company or an independent contractor. In view of the debatabel facts found in the record, and in view of the propriety of obtaining as much enlightenment as possible on the main issue, it is deemed advisable to set forth a considerable portion of Ora's testimony. He testified: 




Q. Do you know the truck T-101? — A. Yes, sir. 


Q. 	Whose is that truck ? — A. Mine. 


Q. Showing you this document which I ask to be marked Exhibit 1(certificate of ownership of a truck ) state what is that document? — A.This is the document of my truck.

Q. As owner of the truck, don't you have any note? — A. No, sir. 


Q. Is that truck No. T-101 the only one you have? — A. I Have some more. 


Q. Some more? — A. Yes, sir. 


Q. For rent? — A. For my own use.

Q. For the exclusive use of Norton & Harrison ? — A. No, sir, I use it also for the transportation of lime. 




It is evident from the foregoing that Ora was a contractor and an employee at the same time of Norton & Harrison Co. Reverting now to the law, counsel for neither party has considered it necessary to assist the court in this regard. However, just as the ascertainment of the facts is important, so is it important to have before us the applicable law. 


The Penal Code makes provisions for the civil liability of persons criminally liable, and establishes subsidiary liability for persons and corporations engaged in any kind of industry for felonies and misdemeanors committed by their servants in the discharge of their duties. (Penal Code, arts. 17-20.) In this instance, recurring to the facts, it should have been mentioned that the two youths, Binoya and Bautista, pleaded guilty to the crime of homicide through reckless negligence, and were sentenced accordingly. 


The basis of civil law liability is not 
respondeat superior
 but the relationship of 
paterfamilias
. This theory bases the liability of the master ultimately on his own negligece and not on that of his servant. (Bahia vs. Litonjua and Leynes [1915], 30 Phil., 624; Cangco vs. Manila Railroad Co. [1918], 38 Phil., 768. As to Porto Rico, see Acosta vs. Porto Rico Gas Co. [1915], 7 Porto Rico Fed., 475; and Ortiz vs. Ezquiaga [1918], 10 Porto Rico Fed., 350.) Article 1902 of the Civil Code provides: 




Any person who by an act or omission causes damage to another by his fault or negligence shall be liable for the damage so done.  Article 1903, paragraphs 4 and 7 of the same Code provides: 


Owners or directors of any establishment or business are, in the same way, liable for any damages caused by their employees while engaged in the branch of the service in which employed, or an occasion of the performance of their duties. 


The liability imposed by this article shall cease in case the persons subject thereto prove that they exercised all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent the damage. 




It is well to repeat that under the civil law an employer is only liable for the negligence of his employees in the discharge of their respective duties. The defense of independent contractor would be a valid one in the Philippines just as it would be in the United States. Here Ora was a contractor, but it does not necessarily follow that he was an independent contractor. The reason for this distinction is that the employer retained the power of directing and controlling the work. The chauffeur and the two persons on the truck were the employees of Ora, the contractor, but Ora, the contractor, was an employee of Norton & Harrison Co., charged with the duty of directing the loading and transportation of the lumber. And it was the negligence in loading the lumber and the use of minors on the truck which caused the death of the unfortunate boy. On the facts and the law, Ora was not an independent contractor, but was the servant of the defendant, and for his negligence defendant was responsible. 


Conceding that the record discloses a most unusual state of facts, and conceding that the evidence is not as ample as it should be, nevertheless on the record as it is and on the law as it is, it is incumbent on the court to rule that error was committed in the lower court in not awarding the father of the dead boy damages for the wrongful death of his son. It has been the practice of this court in cases of death through negligence, in the absence of special proof, to allow the sum of P1,000. (Manzanares vs. Moreta [1918], 38 Phil., 821; Bernal and Enverso vs. House and Tacloban Electric & Ice Plant [1930], 54 Phil., 327.) Judgment will be reversed, and in the court of origin another judgment will issue in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P1,000. So ordered, without special finding as to costs in either instance.

Separate Opinions




VILLA-REAL., 
J., 
concurring: 


I concur in the result. 


I am of the opinion, however, that the case at bar is governed by the provisions of article 20 in connection with article 17 of the Penal Code and article 1092 of the Civil Code, and not by the provisions of articles 1902 and 1903 of the latter Code. 


Ora was a foreman of the defendants Norton and Harrison for the loading and unloading of their lumber the falling of which caused the death of the son of the plaintiff Balbino Cuison. As such foreman, Ora was the agent or employee of Norton and Harrison. In the performance of his duties as such foreman, he used the services of Francisco Bautista and Telesforo Binoya for the loading and unloading of said lumber, thus making them his employees in such work, and consequently the employees of Norton and Harrison through him. 


Under the provisions of article 20 of the Penal Code persons and corporations engaged in any kind of industry are subsidiarily liable for felonies and misdemeanors committed by their employees. There is in the complaint filed in the present action sufficient allegation that the said Francisco Bautista and Telesforo Binoya committed the crime of homicide through reckless imprudence in the handling of the lumber of Norton and Harrison and that they were the employees of said firm. Norton and Harrison are therefore civilly liable for the crime of homicide through reckless negligence committed by their said employees, such liability being of subsidiary nature.
