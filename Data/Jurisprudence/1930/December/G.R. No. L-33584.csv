vs.


PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, ET AL.,
 defendants-appellees.


Eduardo Montenegro for appellant.

VILLA-REAL, 
J.:


Marcelo Enriquez has appealed to this court from the judgment of the  Court of First Instance of Oriental Negros, the dispositive part of  which reads as follows:




Wherefore, the court holds that the sales made at public auction by  the provincial sheriff to the National Bank of Cebu on the 25th of April  and the 6th of July, 1927, respectively, are null and void, as well as  that made to the defendant Laureano Abella, on the 7th of May, 1928,  reserving, however, the right of retention in favor of defendants,  National Bank and Laureano Abella, for having paid the delinquent land  taxes upon the two parcels of land in question. With costs against  the defendants equally.




In support of his appeal the appellant assigns the following alleged  errors as committed by the court below, to wit:




1.	The trial court erred in not awarding actual damages to the  appellant notwithstanding the undisproved, preponderant evidence in  support thereof; and in declaring that the Government was entitled to  the products of the lands in question.


2.	The trial court erred in not awarding to the appellant the five  hundred pesos as sheriff's penalty under section 455, Code of Civil  Procedure.


3.	The trial court erred in not reconsidering its decision and in not  granting a new trial as prayed for.




The instant case originated with a complaint filed by Marcelo Enriquez  against the Philippine National Bank, Atilano Villegas, as provincial  sheriff of Oriental Negros, and Laureano Abella, containing the  following prayer:

Wherefore, this Honorable Court is respectfully prayed (
a
) to render  judgment in favor of plaintiff and against the defendant, declaring null  and void and without effect and revoking the sale of the above-mentioned  lands; (
b
) to require defendants to make an accounting of all the  fruits and products of said lands since date of occupying and possession  by the defendants up to the present time; (
c
) to order defendant  Philippine National Bank to allow the plaintiff to repurchase  said two parcels of land in case the above-mentioned sale is not  ordered revoked; (
d
) to order defendants to pay solidarily the plaintiff  damages in the amount of P20,320; (
e
) to declare null and void the sale  of January 10, 1928, of the two parcels above-mentioned to Laureano Abella  as well as any other agreement made by the Philippine National Bank  regarding sale, mortgage, cession, lease and unsufruct of said lands to  any other person; (
 f 
) to order defendants to pay costs of this action;  and (
g
) to grant the plaintiff such other remedy and relief as the  court deems just and equitable.




In answer to the complaint, the defendants denied each and every  allegation thereof, setting up several special defenses and a  cross-complaint for damages sustained by the bank in its reputation  consequent upon the institution of the action, which is alleged to  have been malicious.


The relevant facts necessary to solve the questions raised in the  instant appeal are as follows:


On and prior to the 15th of June, 1926, Marcelo Enriquez was indebted  to the Philippine National Bank of Cebu in the amount of P4,512.21,  one of his sureties being the defendant-appellee, Laureano Abella.  By virtue of a complaint filed by said bank against Marcelo Enriquez,  Laureano Abella, and Andres Abellana to collect the amount of P3,544.66,  the Court of First Instance of Cebu rendered judgment requiring  said defendants, Marcelo Enriquez, Laureano Abella, and Andres Abellana,  to pay the plaintiff the sum of P4,512.21 jointly and severally, with  interest at nine per cent per annum. With the consent of the bank,  said decision was revoked by Judge Guillermo F. Pablo. On March 26,  1927, by an agreement of counsel for both parties, Judge Jose de la  Rama reinstated the judgment, with the condition that a writ of  execution would be issued first against the defendant Marcelo Enriquez,  and in case of his insolvency, against the defendants Andres Abellana and  Laureano Abella. In accordance with said judgment a writ of execution  was issued on March 29, 1927, attaching the two parcels of land belonging  to the judgment debtor, Marcelo Enriquez, which were sold afterwards to  the bank itself, being the highest bidder. Later on, Marcelo Enriquez's  right of redemption was likewise sold, being adjudicated to the defendant  Laureano Abella. For non-payment of the land tax, the two lots were  forfeited by the Government. At the request of the defendant judgment  debtor, the bank redeemed said lands from the Government on September  27, 1927, paying the delinquent land taxes which amounted to P2,004.48.  Said public auction sale has been declared null and void by the court  below in the judgment appealed from.


The first question to decide on appeal, raised in the first assignment  of error, is whether the plaintiff-appellant is entitled to damages for  the possession by the Philippine National Bank of the lands in question  from the time they were redeemed from the Government.


The judicial sale of the two parcels of land under execution, having been  held null and void, they reverted to the same juridical condition in  which they were before said sale. When the Philippine National Bank  redeemed them from the Government, it was acting as judgment creditor.  Under section 377 of the Administrative Code, the bank acquired a lien  on them by virtue of said redemption, and the Government was divested of  the ownership thereof which reverted in the original owner, Marcelo  Enriquez. The Philippine National Bank, then, cannot be said to have  held the property by virtue of the redemption in behalf of the  Government, but as a creditor with a lien thereon. Since the Philippine  National Bank took possession of the two parcels of land with the  consent of the debtor, Marcelo Enriquez, it held the land as an  antichretic creditor with the right to collect the credit with interest  from the fruits, returning to the antichretic debtor the balance, if  any, after deducting the expenses. The fact that Marcelo Enriquez  consented and asked the bank to take charge of managing said property  does not entitle the latter to appropriate to itself the fruits thereof  unless the former has expressly waived his right thereto.


The second assignment of error is not well taken, for it has not been  sufficiently proved that the defendant provincial sheriff of Oriental  Negros acted in bad faith in publishing the notice of the  auction sale of the lands in question in a Cebu newspaper which he  believed had a circulation in Oriental Negros, and in reducing the sale  price, in view of the redemption made by the bank of the said lands  which had been forfeited to the Government for delinquency in the  payment of the land tax, because the law grants a lien to the third party  who redeems real estate which has been forfeited.


In view of the foregoing considerations, we are of opinion and so hold  that the creditor who redeems from the Government real estate belonging  to his debtor, forfeited for delinquency in the payment of the land tax,  and takes possession thereof, is bound to render an account of the net  proceeds received from said property after deducting all the expenses  incurred and the amount advanced for redemption, with interest.


By virtue whereof, and with the sole modification that the  defendant-appellee, the Philippine National Bank, is required to render  an account of the net proceeds from the lands redeemed by it  during its possession thereof, after deducting all the expenses  incurred and the amount paid for redemption, with interest, the judgment  appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So ordered.


Avanceña, C.J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand and Johns,  JJ., concur.
