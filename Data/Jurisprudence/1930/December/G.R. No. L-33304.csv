VILLAMOR, 
J.:


The Sotelo brothers, namely, Constante, Dominador, and Vicente, were  prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur for the crime  of homicide under the following information:




That on or about the night of December 24, 1929, in the municipality of  Narvacan, Province of Ilocos Sur, Philippine Islands, the said accused  Constante, Dominador, and Vicente Sotelo, armed with a penknife, a stick,  and an iron bar, respectively, acting together and helping one another,  did willfully, maliciously, unlawfully, and feloniously with treachery  and evident premeditation attack, beat up, and commit assault upon the  person of Ignacio Cambaliza, inflicting a mortal wound upon him on the  level of the left nipple, which penetrated the left lung and the  left ventricle of the heart, another on the outward surface of the right  arm, a bruise on the nose and another on the upper lip: as a result of  which said Ignacio Cambaliza died after a few minutes.


Contrary to law; with the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior  strength.




After the trial, the court below found the defendant Constante Sotelo  guilty of the crime of homicide, and the defendants Vicente and Dominador  Sotelo of slight physical injuries, sentencing the former to suffer  twelve years and one day of 
reclusion temporal
, to indemnify the heirs  of the deceased in the sum P1,000, with the accessories of law, and to  pay one-third of the costs; and ordering the release of Vicente and  Dominador Sotelo in view of the fact that they had already been imprisoned  since December 24, 1929, with two-thirds of the costs 
de oficio
.


The defendant Constante Sotelo appealed from this judgment, and his  counsel has made the following assignments of error:




I.	The trial court erred in accepting the whole theory of the prosecution:


Despite the obvious incongruity between the information and the evidence  adduced at the trial;
lawphi1>net


Despite the proof that the iron bar, Exhibit B of the prosecution and  Exhibit 1 of the defense, belong to the principal witness, Baltazar  Capistrano, and not to any of the defendants;


Despite the fact that it has been proved that the incident took place  in the yard of the defendants' house and not on the public road;


Despite the fact that Baltazar Capistrano deliberately concealed the  place where the deceased expired, fearing his participation in the  tragedy should come to light; and


Despite the fact that the chief of police acted with evident partiality  towards Cambaliza and Capistrano, in intervening immediately after the  incident had occurred, hiding the whip or riding crop, which the other  local authorities found hanging from the right arm of the deceased, and  for the other reasons.


II.	The trial court erred in finding the following facts: that Dominador  Sotelo hit the deceased across the mouth with the crop Exhibit B, Vicente  Sotelo stabbed him on the right shoulder with the penknife Exhibit D,  and Constante Sotelo stabbed him under the nipple.


III.	The trial court erred in refusing to consider the plea of self-defense  alleged and proved by the defendant-appellant, Constante Sotelo,  notwithstanding the fact that said defense is strongly corroborated by  Exhibits O, 5, and 4, which form a part of the 
res gestae
.


IV.	The lower court erred in refusing to consider the motion of February  1, 1930, declaring afterwards that, as the defendant has shown graphically,  the latter could not have touched the victim's left breast in stabbing  him, or the wound would not have been in the direction described in Dr.  Nolasco's certificate; in spite of the fact that it had made contrary  declarations during the trial, which estop it from making the subsequent  holdings.


V.	The trial judge erred in convicting the defendant appellant,  Constante Sotelo.




The record shows that at about 8 o'clock in the evening of the 24th of  December, 1929, Ignacio Cambaliza started for the barrio of Ravadabia,  in the municipality of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, accompanied by Baltazar  Capistrano. They took the provincial road leading to said barrio and as  they approached the Sotelo house, they bid the time of day, asking  whether they might pass by, according to the custom of the place. They  were barely 20 meters away from the house, when the defendant Constante  Sotelo, who had just finished his supper, descended from the house towards  the road, and, from the entrance of his yard, turned his flashlight on  the passers-by to see who they were. When Ignacio Cambaliza saw this,  he walked back to where Constante Sotelo stood and inquired why he turned  his flashlight on them, and what it was he wanted, winding up with a  vulgar remark. When Constante's brothers, who were then in the yard on  the side of the road, saw Cambaliza's attitude, they approached their  brother to separate or defend him, whereupon Cambaliza's commenced beating  them with his iron crop, once striking Constante's arm. The brothers,  in turn, fell upon Cambaliza, Dominador striking him across the face with  the stick he carried, and Vicente wounding him in the right shoulder with  a penknife. At this juncture, Capistrano attempted to intervene, but he  was warned by Vicente and probably by Dominador also, for which reason  he withdrew from the scene, and the fight then continued between Cambaliza  and Constante. In the course of this fight, Constante thrust a penknife  into Cambaliza at about the level of the left nipple, producing a wound  which penetrated the left lung into the left ventricle of the heart,  resulting in his death a few minute later.


Witness Baltazar Capistrano, who was with the deceased, says that after  Ignacio Cambaliza had fallen lifeless, he went over to the municipal  building to ask for help, and at once the chief of police, the justice  of the peace, and the municipal president repaired to the place where  the incident had occurred, placing the brothers under arrest that same  night: Constante with a penknife, Vicente with another penknife, and  Dominador with a cane.


Doctor Antonio Nolasco examined Ignacio Cambaliza's body, and found a  knife wound at about the level of the left nipple, 2 1/2 centimeters  long, and 2 1/2 inches deep; a knife wound on the outward surface of  the right arm, 4 centimeters deep; and bruises at the base of the nose  and on the upper lip, produced by a blunt instrument. According to the  doctor the breast wound which pierced the left lung and the left  ventricle of the heart was the cause of Ignacio Cambaliza's death.


The appellant admits he inflicted the injury which resulted in Ignacio  Cambaliza's death, but maintains he did so in self-defense. In support  of this allegation it is insisted that the fight took place in the yard  of the defendants' house; that Vicente and Dominador went to help their  brother Constante when they saw Cambaliza attack him, but ran behind some  sugar cane near by in order to conceal themselves when pursued by Cambaliza;  that the latter fought hand to hand with Constante, choked him and threw  himself upon him, and at that instant Constante thrust a penknife into  his ribs below the left nipple; that Capistrano answered Cambaliza's call,  saying that Constante had stabbed him, and, with the assistance of  Capistrano, Cambaliza succeeded in leaving the Sotelo yard and after a  few steps fell lifeless on the roadside, where his body was later found.


After examining the evidence of record, we believe the defense is, in  a measure, supported by the testimony of Baltazar Capistrano given before  the justice of the peace of Narvacan. In considering this proof it is well  to remember that the justice of the peace of Narvacan testified in the  case that Baltazar Capistrano made two statements before him — in the  investigation prior to the arrest of the defendants, which is Exhibit 9,  and in the course of the preliminary investigation, embodied in Exhibit  10. Counsel for the defense attempted to examine Capistrano on these two  statements, but the fiscal objected, and the court sustained the objection  on the ground that the best evidence would be Capistrano's own statements  taken down in writing. Counsel then required the fiscal to present said  documents, and the latter delivered to him the aforementioned Exhibits 9  and 10, which were offered in evidence by the defense. The fiscal  reiterated his objection to that evidence on the ground that the documents  were not identified; but the record shows that they had been delivered by  the fiscal himself to counsel for the defense, and he is therefore  precluded from setting up the lack of identification, whereupon the court  doubtless ruled them in, and the fiscal failed to take exception therefrom.


The record further shows that counsel for the appellant sought to have  the witness Capistrano explain the contradiction between his statement  in Exhibit 10 and his testimony at the hearing, but the fiscal objected  and the court sustained the objection. Capistrano has thus failed to  explain the contradiction noted between Exhibit 10 and his testimony before  the trial court.


We believe the trial judge erred in sustaining the fiscal's objection to  having witness Capistrano explain the contradiction between his statement  in Exhibit 10, and his testimony before the trial court at the hearing.  But be that as it may, we are of opinion that said documents Exhibits 9 and  10 have been duly introduced into the case as evidence for the defense and  must therefore be taken into consideration in rendering judgment.


In said Exhibit 10, witness Capistrano, among other things, affirms the  following:




As we passed by Constante was flashlighting us and he was standing by the  door of their yard. I did not see any body by him. We were then about 20  meters away from him when he rushed to us.


Ignacio was the first one who uttered bad words against Constante. Ignacio  had a whip wrapped with lead.


Other than this time I declared before the justice of the peace.


As Dominador came he struck Ignacio, but Ignacio defended. Vicente struck  and Constante rushed in and then they wrestled against each other and  I tried to separate them.


I was only 5 meters away from them when they first wrestled. It was dark  at that time but I saw what happened by the aid of my flashlight.


I am very sure that Exhibit A was the bar which Vicente was holding and  Exhibit B was the knife that Constante used in stabbing Ignacio.


While they were wrestling Constante was under Ignacio during which time,  I saw Constante bring out his knife.




The same witness testified before the trial court as follows:




Q.	Do you know whether anything extraordinary took place along the road? — A. Yes sir; for when we came near the house of Francisco Sotelo, we saw  Constante, Dominador, and Vicente Sotelo in the yard of the house. I and  my companion said ""we are passing, sir,"" but they did not answer, and  they focused their flashlight on us. And when we came to within ten meters,  they still kept the flashlight focused on us, and then my companion said:  ""Why do you turn your flashlight on us? Have we not greeted you in passing?""


Q.	What did the Sotelo brothers, Constante, Dominador, and Vicente do when  they heard Ignacio Cambaliza say this? — A. After Ignacio Cambaliza had  said that, they switched off the light, and we continued on.


Q.	What else? — A. After we had proceeded about 20 meters, someone came  up behind us with a flashlight saying: ""Wait! your mother's . . .! you cannot  say bad words when you pass here.""


Q.	What else? — A. When they had said this, Ignacio Cambaliza stopped and  said: ""I have used no bad word.""




Ignacio Cambaliza interrupted Constante Sotelo saying ""I did not say that."" And Dominador, in turn, said, ""You didn't say anything, your mother's . . .!""




Q.	And what did Dominador Sotelo do then? — A. Immediately after saying,  ""you didn't say anything, your mothers . . .! he struck him across the face  with a stick.

Q.	And what else happened? — A. After that blow delivered by Dominador  Sotelo, he was stunned. While he was so stunned, Vicente Sotelo stabbed  him with a penknife on the right shoulder; and Ignacio Cambaliza, still  stunned, turning about; and Constante Sotelo stabbed him in the region of  the heart with a penknife.




Comparing the two statements quoted above, it will be seen that the  witness Capistrano affirmed in Exhibit 10 that he saw Constante standing  at the entrance of his yard, alone; that the deceased was the first to  make vulgar remarks to Constante; and that during the fight Constante was  under Cambaliza when he drew his penknife to stab him. On the other hand,  testifying before the trial court, the said witness Capistrano stated that  he and the deceased saw the three brothers, Constante, Dominador, and Vicente  Sotelo in the yard of the house; that one of these brothers was the first  to make insulting remarks to Cambaliza, and that while the two brothers  were attacking Cambaliza, Constante stabbed him in the chest with a  penknife.


We believe Capistrano's testimony appearing in Exhibit 10 as to Constante's  position when he wounded Cambaliza, must be accepted, not only because it  was given two days after the incident, but because it has been corroborated  by the witnesses for the defense. (U. S. 
vs.
 Capisonda, 1 Phil., 575; and  U. S. 
vs.
 Rafael, 23 Phil., 184.)


As to who started the aggression, there is an obvious contradiction  between the testimony of Capistrano and that of the witnesses for the  defense. But in the light of sound judgment, we are inclined to believe  that the deceased started the aggression, provoked by the offensive  language used by Constante and his brothers, imputing to him the utterance  of vulgar language against them. In such a situation the deceased naturally  used his whip against those who were in front of him, striking Constante's  arm. We therefore believe this is a case of incomplete self-defense,  wherein the appellant was unlawfully attacked by the deceased and  compelled to employ reasonable means to defend himself, but he is  responsible for provoking the attack. (U. S. 
vs.
 Ancheta, 1 Phil., 30;  U. S. 
vs.
 McCray, 2 Phil., 545.) According to article 86 of the Penal  Code the penalty next below that provided in article 404 of said Code must  be imposed upon the appellant, that is, prision mayor in its minimum  degree, or six years and one day, with the accessories of law, and to  indemnify the family of the deceased in the amount of P500. And with this  modification the judgment appealed from is affirmed in all other respects,  with costs against the appellant. So ordered.
