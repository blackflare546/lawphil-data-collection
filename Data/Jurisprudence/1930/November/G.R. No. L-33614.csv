STREET, 
J.:


This case has been brought to the Supreme Court upon appeal, for the
 
purpose of reversing a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the
 
Province of Masbate, finding the appellants, Benedicto Cortes, Santiago
 
Cortes, and Honestorio Bellocillo, guilty of the offense of homicide,
 
the first in the character of principal , and the other two in the
 
character of accomplices , and sentencing the pricipal, in view of the
 
aggravating circumstance that advantage was taken of superior strenght,
 
to undergo imprisonment for seventeen years, four months and one day,
 reclusion temporal
, with the accessories prescribed by law, and
 
sentencing the accomplices, in view of the same aggravating
 
circumstance, to undergo imprisonment for ten years and one day
 prision mayor
, with the accessories prescribed by law, and requiring
 
all the accused to indemnify, jointly and severally the heirs of the
 
deceased in the amount of P1,000, without subsidiary imprisonment in
 
case of insolvency and requiring each to pay one-third part of the
 
cost. 


It appears that on the afternoon of February 16,1930, there occured in
 
the cockpit of Punta Buri, barrio of Guiom, municipality of Milagros,
 
Province of Masbate, a contest between two cocks, one of which belonged
 
to Raymundo Cortes, a brother of the appellant Benedicto Cortes and uncle
 
of the appellant Santiago Cortes. The causes of the two feathered
 
champions were respectively sustained by individuals of the barrio of
 
Guiom, on one part, and of the neighboring barrio of Cawayan, on the
 
other. Both of the birds were wounded in the first onset, and a
 
discussion ensued between the partisans of the respective birds as to
 
which of the two had gained the victory, a contention of chief
 
interest to those who had laid their wagers on the one or the other. As
 
no judge was functioning with authority to decide the matter, Candido
 
Malapitan, the owner of the cockpit, declared the fight a draw. Apparently this decision was not satisfactory to all of the persons
 
interested, and after a futile attempt to stage an addtional fight
 
between two other cocks, the sport was abandoned. 


The two factions chiefly concerned in this matter consisted of
 
Benedicto Cortes and others, of the barrio of Guiom and a number of
 
individuals, including one Simeon Kilantang, pertaining to the barrio
 
of Cawayan. After the sport had been concluded and the ring in the
 
cockpit was being cleared, one Anacleto Aballe stepped into the
 
inclosure and asked Candido Malapitan, who had been serving as
 
stakeholder, to return P1 which Anacleto, as one of the Cawayan crowd,
 
had wagered upon one of the birds. Malapitan handed Anacleto the money,
 
and the latter started out. As he turned towards the door, he met the
 
appellant Santiago Cortes to whom he addressed the question why the
 
cockfight had not been proceeded with. Santiago answered, ""What
 
business is that of yours?"" (¿
Que tiene
 
usted que ver?
) Anacleto did
 
not respond but continued on his way out. However, before reaching the
 
threshold, Santiago came up behind him and wounded him in the back with
 
a dagger. Upon being thus attacked Anacleto started to run but was
 
presently confronted by Alejo Cortes, an uncle of Santiago, who struck
 
Anacleto in the breast with a stick. This blow caused Anacleto to fall,
 
but he sustained himself for a moment on his hands and knees. While
 
in this position Benedicto Cortes, the father of Santiago, in turn
 
struck Anacleto on the back with the stem of a coconut branch. 


At this juncture Cipriano Aballe, uncle of Anacleto, came hurrying from
 
the seashore, where he had been standing, to the spot where trouble had
 
arisen, in the hope of aiding his nephew. But as Cipriano Aballe
 
approached, Benedicto Cortes, now armed with a piece of wood called
 togñod,
 struck Cipriano on the left forearm. The blow thus delivered
 
was of sufficient force to fracture Cipriano's arm. At this moment
 
Simeon Kilantang, one of the Cawayan crowd came within reach of the
 
same weapon wielded by Benedicto Cortes, and the latter, confronting
 
Simeon, struck him in the forehead, smashing the frontal bone. Simeon
 
fell to his knees and hands, and while he was in this position,
 
Santiago Cortes struck him on the back of the neck with a round piece
 
of bamboo. Immediately thereafter Honestorio Bellocillo also struck
 
Simeon on the right hip with a club. The three assailants — the present
 
appellants — then ran away, whereupon two daughters and a brother of
 
Simeon took him up and carried him to the beach where they chafed him
 
with water and brought him back momentarily to his senses, When
 
consciousness was restored, Simeon said that he did not know why he had
 
been attacked, as he had done nothing. the same affectionate hands then
 
took up the wounded man to carry him home, but he died in a few moments
 
on the way. 


Such is the story of the homicide as constructed from the testimony of
 
five of the witnesses for the prosecution, and a study of the record
 
leaves no doubt in our mind that this narrative is in the main true. 


This version of the affair is, however, contradicted by a number of
 
witnesses for the defense, whose testimony tends to show that the fatal
 
blow upon the forehead of Simeon Kilantang was delivered by the hands
 
of Santiago Cortes, and not by the father Benedicto Cortes; while,
 
according to the same witnesses, the only blow struck by Benedicto
 
Cortes was the one that landed on the back of the neck of Simeon after
 
he had fallen to his hands and knees, It will thus be seen that the two
 
sets of witnesses, for the prosecution and defense respectively, impute
 
the two blows on the forehead and back of the neck of the deceased to
 
precisely different agents. At the same time the testimony of the
 
defendant's witnesses tends to show that in the outbreak of the quarrel
 
between Anacleto Aballe and Santiago Cortes, the former was the
 
aggressor. The defense therefore, is directed along the line of showing
 
that Santiago Cortes acted in self-defense and that Benedicto Cortes
 
merely intervened to assist his son. 


The artificial nature of this line of proof is conspicuous in the
 
testimony of Santiago Cortes who pretends that, when the altercation
 
occurred between him and Anacleto in the ring of the cockpit, Anacleto
 
drew a knife, whereupon a struggle ensued between the two for the
 
possession of this weapon , and while they were thus contending, Anacleto Aballe cut himself in the back with his own knife. It is
 
evident, however, that the knife referred to was in the hands of
 
Santiago Cortes in the beginning and that the instrument was wielded by
 
Santiago when Anacleto received a wound from it in the back. In this
 
connection we note that the wound referred to was located about one and
 
one-half inches from the backbone, at the level of the eleventh dorsal
 
vertebra, and was one and one-half inches deep. Our conclusion from
 
reading the proof is that the trial court committed no error in holding
 
that the blow which resulted in the death of Simeon Kilantang came from
 
the hands of the appellant Benedicto Cortes. 


The offense committed was undoubtedly homicide, and we concur in the
 
estimate made of the offense by the trial court to the effect that
 
Benedicto Cortes is guilty in the character of principal and Santiago
 
Cortes and Honestorio Bellocillo in the character of accomplices only.
 
In this connection two decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain are
 
pertinent, which are summed up respectively as follows: 




Two individuals attacked a third person inflicting two lesions, one
 
fatal, the other curable in twenty days. The Supreme Court declared
 
that the author of the latter injury is responsible for the crime of
 
homicide, in the character of accomplice, and not of the crime of
 
inflicting physical injuries, on the ground that, although the injury
 
inflicted by the other codefendant was the one that caused death to the
 
person slain, it is nevertheless undeniable that, by the infliction of
 
the other wound at the same time, the author of the latter cooperated
 
in the tragic result, and that consequently, in accordance with
 
article 15 of the Code, he should be considered as an accomplice in the
 
homicide, since, without having taken part, in its execution in either
 
of the three ways indicated in article 13, he cooperated in the
 
offense by means of a simultaneous act. (Sentence of December 1,1873;
 
l — Hidalgo, 
Codigo Penal
, 303.)

When two persons attack another with clubs and strike him to the
 
ground and then a third person gets upon him, trampling upon his face
 
and breast, will such third person be properly characterized as an
 
accomplice in the homicide if the assaulted person dies as a result of
 
the blows from the clubs? The Supreme Court has resolved the point
 
affirmatively, basing its resolution upon the proposition that even
 
though such third person did not take part in the infliction of the
 
fatal injury with the club, for which reason he cannot be brought under
 
article 13 (as pricipal) , he nevertheless cooperated simultaneously in
 
the tragic result by kicking the person slain, who was on the ground
 
wounded; and this simultaneously of acts contributing to the homicide
 
makes him an accomplice in the same. (Sentence, December 29,1884,
 
Gazette of August 22, 1885; 2 Viada, 
Codigo Penal
, 5th ed., 431.) 




But while we concur with the trial court in the qualification of the
 
pricipal feature of the case, we are of the opinion that his Honor
 
erred in estimating as present in the case the aggravating circumstance
 
that advantage was taken of superior strength (art.10, subs. 9, Penal
 
Code.) The estimation of this circumstance is essentially inconsistent
 
with the finding that only one of the three accused is guilty in the
 
character of pricipal, while the other two participated in the
 
character of accomplices only. Where the abuse of superior strength is
 
to be estimated as an aggravating circumstance from the mere fact that
 
more than one person participated in the offense, it must appear that
 
the accused cooperated together in some way designed to weaken the
 
defense; and if, in the case before us, the two accomplices really
 
participated in the sense necessary to enable the court to estimate
 
against them the aggravating circumstance mentioned, this would make
 
them guilty in the character of principals. But the court having found
 
that only one of the three was a principal and that the other two did
 
not cooperate in the way necessary to make them principals, it is
 
evident that the single principal cannot be said to have taken
 
advantage of superior strength; nor can said aggravating circumstance
 
be estimated against the accomplices. It is difficult to see how the
 
distinctive aggravating circumstance now under consideration could
 
ever be present in a contest between two individuals of approximately
 
equal powers. In the case before us the blows delivered by the three
 
accused upon the body of the deceased, though simultaneous in the
 
sense necessary to determine complicity on the part of Santiago Cortes
 
and Honestorio Bellocillo, such acts having been part of the same fatal
 
assault, nevertheless those blows were not delivered in unison. It is
 
evident also that the element of prior conspiracy among the three
 
accused was wanting. It results that the respective penalties imposed
 
upon all of the accused must be reduced to the medium degree. 


To correct the error above indicated, as well as to adjust the
 
provision regarding indemnity to the requirement of articles 124 and
 
125 of the Penal Code, the dispositive part of the appealed decision is
 
hereby amended in the sense that the appellant Benedicto Cortes, as
 
principal is sentenced to undergo imprisonment for fourteen years,
 
eight months and one day, 
reclusion temporal
 , with the accessories
 
prescribed by law, and to pay indemnity to the heirs of the deceased in
 
the amount of P500, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
 
insolvency; and that the appellants, Santiago Cortes and Honestorio
 
Bellocillo, as accomplices, are each sentenced to undergo imprisonment
 
for eight years and one day, 
prision mayor
, with the accessories
 
prescribed by law, and to pay, jointly and severally, to the heirs of
 
the deceased the sum of P500 as indemnity, without subsidiary
 
imprisonment in case of insolvency. And it is further ordered that, in
 
case of insolvency of Santiago Cortes and Honestorio Bellocillo,
 
Benedicto Cortes, shall be subsidiary liable for their share of the
 
indemnity; and in case of the insolvency of Benedicto Cortes, as
 
pricipal, the accomplices Santiago Cortes and Honestorio Bellocillo
 
shall be subsidiarily liable, jointly and severally, for the indemnity
 
due from said pricipal. As thus modified, the judgment is affirmed,
 
with proportional costs against each of the appellants. So ordered. 


Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez and Villa-Real, JJ.,
 
concur.
