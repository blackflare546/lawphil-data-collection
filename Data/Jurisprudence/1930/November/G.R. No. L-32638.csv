ROMUALDEZ, 
J.:


The plaintiffs claim an unpaid credit against the deceased spouses
 
Gregorio Yulo and Filomena Ortiz in the amount of P3,261.59, alleging that they have filed their claim with the committee of claims and appraisal appointed in the intestate proceedings of Gregorio Yulo, that it was admitted by said committee and approved
 
by the court; that although the intestate proceedings of Filomena Ortiz
 
were instituted in 1913, the conjugal partnership between the two
 
spouses has not yet been liquidated, and certain lots described in the
 
complaint belong to said partnership; that after Filomena Ortiz's
 
death but during the lifetime of her husband, Gregorio Yulo, those
 
lots were registered one-half in undivided ownership in the name of the
 
latter, and the other half in the name of his six children, the
 
defendants herein; that the balance mentioned above remains unsatisfied
 
because as the intestate administrator of Gregorio Yulo alleges, he has not funds enough in his possession, and because the inventory value
 
of the lands still unsold is not sufficient to meet the mortgage and
 
ordinary obligations; that to be able to comply with the order of the
 
court that the lots aforesaid be sold so as to satisfy the obligations of said estate, the administrator proposed that certain
 
of the lots owned in common by the decedent Gregorio Yulo and by his six
 
children, be turned over wholly and exclusively to said deceased's
 
estate, and certain others to the children as heirs of their deceased
 
mother; that the court approved the proposal providing that the
 
property adjudicated to the children should remain subject to
 
the payment of the obligations of said intestate estate; that
 
subsequently, on petition of the administrator, that order was amended
 
to read that the property adjudicated to the children should be theirs
 
free of all liens and encumbrances; that all this was done without
 
the knowledge or consent of the creditors nor the plaintiffs; that up to that time
 
the plaintiffs had not filed their claim because foreclosure
 
proceedings on the mortgage executed by the deceased spouses in favor
 
of the plaintiffs' predecessor in interest, were pending; that when the
 
aforesaid property was divided into two equal parts 
pro indiviso
, one
 
in favor of Gregorio Yulo and the other in favor of his children and
 
not of their deceased mother's estate, the mortgage credit, of which the
 
present claims is an unpaid balance, already existed, and the defendants
 
were aware that such adjudication was based upon the proposition that
 
the property thus divided was conjugal property, and that they, the
 
defendants, were heirs of their deceased mother; that inasmuch as
 
the original partnership has not yet been dissolved, and the present
 
claim is an obligation against it, all the estate of said spouses answers
 
for the claim, which is a lawful lien upon it that the approval of the
 
aforementioned barter would defraud the creditors, especially the
 
plaintiffs, who were not notified and did not consent to it; that the
 
property adjudicated to the defendants in that barter was really a part
 
of the conjugal property; that according to the administrator's report,
 
the estate of Gregorio Yulo is insolvent, for which reason the
 
plaintiffs will be unable to collect their credit unless it is
 
enforced as a lawful lien on the said property adjudicated to the
 
defendants individually. And plaintiffs pray for judgment: (
a
) That the
 
order dated August 7, 1926, as well as that dated September 1, 1926,
 
amending the former given in proceeding No. 1322 entitled Estate of
 
Gregorio Yulo be annulled; (
b
) that the plaintiffs' claim of three
 
thousand two hundred sixty-one pesos and fifty-nine centavos
 
(P3,261.59), with legal interest from August 8, 1926, constitutes a
 
lawful lien on lots Nos. 361, 578, 924, 427, 852, 16, 86, 625,
 
626, 8710, 233 of the cadastre of Iloilo, 1167, 1169, 1170, 3245, 3365
 
of the cadastre of Jaro, 3759, 3494 of  the cadastre of La Paz, the two
 
parcels of land situated in the municipality of Jaro Province of
 
Iloilo, described above, the eight parcels of land situated in the municipality of Buenavista, Province of Iloilo
, 
described above, and the eight parcels of land situated in the municipality of Jordan, Province of Iloilo, described above; (c) that
 
if the aforesaid order of August 7, 1926, and the one amending it
 
cannot be annulled, that the aforesaid claim of the plaintiffs be deemed
 
a lawful lien on lots Nos. 16, 86, 625, 626, 87, 233 of the cadastre of
 
Iloilo, 3759, 3494 of the cadastre of La Paz, the six parcels of land
 
situated in the municipality of Buenavista, Province of Iloilo, and
 
the six parcels of land situated in the municipality of Jordan,
 
Province of Iloilo, adjudicated in the municipality of Jordan,
 
Province of Iloilo, adjudicated to the children of the Filomena Ortiz;
 
and (
d)
 the defendants be ordered to pay the plaintiffs jointly and
 
severally the amount of three thousand two hundred sixty-one pesos and
 
fifty-nine centavos (P3,261.59) and the costs, and that the sale of the
 
aforementioned lands be ordered to satisfy the claim of the plaintiffs,
 
granting to the plaintiffs such other relief as may be just and
 
equitable.


The defendant Francisco Ortiz answered the complaint with a general
 
denial.


The defendant administrator of the intestate estate of Gregorio Yulo
 
answered that if the barter (permuta) referred to in the complaint was
 
solicited and approved by the court, it was only done to comply with
 
the urgent judicial orders, so as to be able to sell property of the
 
inheritance and to pay its obligations, the barter aforesaid being it the
 
adequate means to bring it about; that some of the property listed in
 
the complaint has already been sold by proper deeds of conveyance to
 
third persons with the approval of the court; that the acts of said
 
administrator were all done in good faith and in pursuance of the just
 
orders of the court. This defendant prays that the complaint be
 
dismissed and that he absolved therefrom with costs against the
 
plaintiffs.


The defendants Marina Yulo and Jorge B. Vargas demurred on the ground
 
that the complaint did not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a
 
cause of action, and that the court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action. After
 
the plaintiff had replied to this demurrer, and after due hearing, the
 
court overruled it with the exception of said defendants.


The defendants Gloria Yulo and Jose Varela also demurred to the
 
complaint on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction over the
 
litigation; that the plaintiffs had no personality to bring the action;
 
that there was another case pending between the same parties upon the
 
same cause of action; that there was a defect of parties defendant
 
in that the administrator of the estate of Filomena Ortiz was not
 
included, and that the facts alleged in the complaint did not
 
constitute a cause of action. The plaintiffs replied, and after due
 
hearing, the court also overruled this demurrer, the defendants
 
excepting.


Mariano Yulo and Jorge B. Vargas answered the complaint with a general
 
denial and a special defense to the effect that the court had no
 
jurisdiction; that the plaintiffs did not file their claim in the
 
intestate proceeding instituted upon the death of Filomena Ortiz but
 
elected to foreclose the mortgage, and therefore they are now
 
precluded from enforcing said claim against the property of the heirs
 
of said Filomena Ortiz; that said property is duly registered in
 
accordance with the Land Registration Law with a certificate of title and
 
without any lien or encumbrance in favor of the plaintiffs; that both
 
the motion referred to in paragraph 9 of the complaint and the orders
 
given by the court with regard to said petition were known to the
 
attorneys of the plaintiffs at the time they were filed in the
 
course of the proceedings or immediately thereafter; that
 
notwithstanding said knowledge, that plaintiffs did not object to said
 
motion nor ask for the reconsideration of said orders during the
 
period prescribed by the law and regulations, for which reason said
 
rulings became final and binding on the plaintiffs; that more than a
 
year from the filing of the complaint in the instant case, Yap Tico &
 
Co., alleging a claim against the property of the heirs of Filomena
 
Ortiz, deceased, filed a
 
motion to enforce their claim, and that as well as of the court's
 
action thereon, the plaintiffs were fully aware, and still they failed to
 
make any claim to said property, for which reason, in view of such
 
abandonment, they lost their right to present such a claim, if they
 
ever had it; and that the ruling of the court on the partition of the
 
property between the estate of Gregorio Yulo on the one hand, and the
 
heirs of Filomena Ortiz on the other, has long since been final. These
 
defendants pray for the dismissal of the action with costs against the
 
plaintiffs.


The defendants Gloria Yulo and Jose Varela answered the complaint with
 
a general and several special defenses to the effect that the orders
 
which the plaintiffs seek to annul were, in view of the facts and
 
circumstances of the case, justly rendered in said City of Iloilo where
 
the attorneys of the plaintiffs reside, and no appeal having been taken
 
from them, they became final and irrevocable; that in virtue thereof,
 
third persons have acquired rights over a large part of the property
 
dealt with in said orders, and to annul the latter now would be to
 
trample upon the rights of said third persons; that the plaintiffs
 
have not complied with section 708 of the Code of Civil Procedure in
 
that, before filing their claim for P3,261.59 with the committee of
 
claims and appraisal in the intestate proceedings of Gregorio Yulo,
 
they did not obtain judgment for the unsecured portion of the credit
 
after the mortgage was foreclosed, for which reason said committee of
 
claims had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of and approve said
 
claim; that there is a defect of parties in that not all the third
 
parties who acquired properly belonging to the estate of Gregorio
 
Yulo in pursuance of the aforementioned orders of the court have been
 
included; that the credit claimed by the plaintiffs was one exclusively
 
against Gregorio Yulo, and not against the conjugal partnership with his
 
wife;
 
that in the course of the intestate proceedings of Gregorio Yulo there has been rendered an irrevocable ruling providing for the partition of the property of said deceased and his wife's children the defendants herein; that there is no judicial holding that said intestate estate is insolvent; that the property which the plaintiffs want brought to collation was adjudicated to the defendants under the
 
Torrens system over four years ago, and the proper titles have been
 
issued; that, in like manner, lots Nos. 460, 883, and 4255 of the
 
cadastre of Iloilo described in the complaint in civil case No. 5631
 
have been registered; that far from objecting to such a determination of
 
the share of Gregorio Yulo and that of his children in said property,
 
the plaintiff's predecessors in interest acquiesced in it causing it to
 
appear in the adjudication of said lots that there was a mortgage
 
executed in their favor by the spouses Gregorio Yulo and Filomena Ortiz,
 
which acquiescence was confirmed in the action brought in civil case
 
No. 5631; that if the plaintiff's claim is debt chargeable to the
 
conjugal partnership, the same has already prescribed for the reason
 
that the plaintiffs have not asked for the liquidation of said conjugal
 
partnership dissolved on January 13, 1911, when Filomena Ortiz died. These defendants pray for the dismissal of the complaint with costs
 
against the plaintiffs.


After hearing the case, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo rendered
 
judgment, the dispositive part of which is follows:


For all the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby entered:




(a) Setting aside as null and void the orders dated August 7, 1926,
 
Exhibit N, and September 1,1926, Exhibit O, rendered in case No. 1322,
 
entitled ""
In re
 Estate of Gregorio Yulo;""


(b) Holding that the claim of the plaintiffs in the amount of three
 
thousand two hundred sixty-one pesos and fifty-nine centavos
 
(P3,261.59), with legal interest from August 8, 1926, constitutes a
 
lawful lien on lots Nos. 16, 86, 87, 1233, 625 and 626 of the cadastre
 
of Iloilo, 3759 and 3494 of the cadastre of La Paz, the six parcels of
 
land situated in the municipality of Buenavista, Province of Iloilo,
 
and the six parcels situated in the municipality of Jordan, Province of
 
Iloilo, all adjudicated to the children of Filomena Ortiz with her
 
husband Gregorio Yulo and described in the order dated August 7, 1926,
 
Exhibit N; and


(c) Sentencing the defendants jointly and severally to pay the
 
plaintiffs the amount of three thousand two hundred sixty-one pesos
 
and fifty-nine centavos (P3,261.59), and the costs.
lawphil.net


In view of this decision, the plaintiffs are hereby ordered to take the
 
proper steps to correct, or annul, the transfers that may have been
 
issued in the respective cadastral proceedings in favor of the
 
defendants in pursuance of the proceedings and orders of the court 
In re
 Gregorio Yulo, hereby declared null and void.




The defendants appealed from this judgment making several assignments
 
of error.


The annulment made by the court below of the orders of August 7, 1926
 
(Exhibit N), and September 1, 1926 (Exhibit O), issued in the
 
intestate proceedings of Gregorio Yulo, at the instance of the judicial
 
administrator, is based on the contention that when the latter motion
 
Exhibit N, which gave rise to such judicial orders, he was aware that
 
there had been a decision rendered in favor of the predecessors in
 
interest of the plaintiffs herein against the defendants in civil case
 
No. 5631 (Exhibit D), and also that the selling price at the public
 
auction of the mortgaged property in said civil case No. 5631 was not enough
 
to satisfy that judgment, and lastly that the defendants had not yet
 
paid the mortgage balance in that case.


It is contended that the administrator being aware of said facts, he was
 
bound to give notice of his petition, Exhibit M, to the creditor
 
Antonia Peña y Martinez, which he failed to do.


The court does not find that this reason is sufficient justification for
 
annulling the previous orders. Since said creditor, Antonia Peña y
 
Martinez, or her assigns, did not appear in the intestate proceedings of
 
Gregorio Yulo where said motion was filed until then, the administrator
 
was not
 
in duty bound to notify this creditor of the petition; and, in the
 
absence of fraud, which has neither been alleged nor proved, the lack of
 
this notification does not vitiate that motion or the consequent orders
 
of the court.


This creditor could have put in a timely appearance to object to this
 
petition of the administrator's and thereby prevent the orders now
 
complained of. And unless it be shown that such an appearance was made
 
impossible by the administrator or some other interested party, the
 
said orders must stand like any other judicial order legally issued.


Moreover, the orders referred to, Exhibits N and O, dated August 7,
 
1926, and September 1, 1926, were already final and irrevocable when
 
the instant action was filed, having been neither excepted to nor
 
appealed from in due time.


From this it follows that, as these orders are valid, they subsist fully,
 
and legal condition of the lands concerned as mentioned therein cannot
 
now be altered. Consequently, the lots, which, by virtue of the barter
 
approved in these order, passed to the ownership of the defendants
 
herein cannot now be deemed subject to a lien for the amount of
 
P3,261.59 owed to the plaintiffs.


Although this property was originally conjugal property of Gregorio
 
Yulo and Filomena Ortiz, nevertheless, it was not included in the
 
mortgage executed in favor of the plaintiffs' predecessors in interest
 
and even before the orders, Exhibits N and O, were issued that property
 
and the other involved in the barter had been recorded under the Land
 
Registration Law as property of the defendants free from any
 
encumbrance in favor of the plaintiffs or their predecessors in
 
interest.


Having reached these conclusions, it is unnecessary to decide the
 
other points of defense and error raised by the defendants, for what
 
has so far been held is sufficient definitely determine the rights of the
 
parties.


Wherefore, the order appealed from is revoked, and the defendants are
 
absolved from the complaint without, prejudice to such rights as the
 
plaintiffs may have against them by virtue of the personal obligation
 
arising from the judgments obtained against them on September 9, 1925,
 
and November 20, 1926, in civil case No. 5631. Without costs, so
 
ordered.


Avanceña, C.J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, and Villa-Real,
 
JJ., concur.
