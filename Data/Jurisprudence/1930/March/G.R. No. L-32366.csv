Like stipulations are made as to the sales to other parties aggregating to P83,506.31. 


Exhibits A, B, C, and D, showing the correspondence as to the demands for payment, and the payment under protest, and the refusal to refund, are made part of the stipulation of facts. 


From a judgement for the defendant, plaintiff appealed and claims that: 




The lower court erred in holding that the sales here in question are subject to the merchant's and sales tax, and in not ordering the refund of the tax paid by the plaintiff to the defendant. 




JOHNS, 
J.:


The appellant maintains: 




(1) A sale is not consummated until the delivery of the subject matter thereof from the seller to the purchaser.


(2) The sales tax accrues only upon a consummated sale and not upon a mere contract to sell. 


(3) Furthermore, the sales tax accrues only upon a sale consummated in the Philippine Islands. 


(4) Therefore, a sale negotiated in the Philippine Islands but consummated in the United States is both subject to the sales tax.




And that ""the sales tax is levied not on a contract to sell but on an actual sale."" ""That a consummated sale is necessary in order that the sales tax may be levied, for the tax is on sales and, as we have seen, there is no sale until the contract is consummated by the delivery of the subject matter of the sale from the vendor of the buyer."" Citing section 1459 of the Administrative Code which provides that: 




All merchants not herein specifically exempted shall pay a tax of 1 per centum on the gross value in money of the commodities, goods, wares, and merchandise sold . . . by them.




It must be conceded that the authority to collect the tax in question should be confined and limited to goods, wares, and merchandise which were sold by the plaintiff in the Philippine Islands, and that, if the taxes in question were not levied on goods, wares, and merchandise sold within the meaning of section 1459, plaintiff should not pay the tax. 


It is stipulated that the plaintiff is a domestic corporation, with its principal office in the City of Manila, and that it is a ""manufacturer and merchant doing business in the Philippine Islands."" Also, that the listed order ""relating to the Compania General de Tabacos de Filipina was placed with and accepted by the plaintiff in the latter's place of business in Manila,"" and that it ""was executed by the plaintiff by causing its agent in the City of New York, the Honolulu Iron Works Company, to purchase the machinery and materials to fill the order for plaintiff's account from the manufacturers in the United States of America,"" and that these manufacturers pursuant to such instructions from the plaintiff's duly authorized agent, shipped said materials from the very point of manufacture in the United States to the City of Manila, ""taking shipping documents from the carriers to the order of themselves,"" notify plaintiff. That is to say, the order for the machinery and merchandise was delivered to and accepted by the plaintiff at its office here in the City of Manila which on its receipt authorized its agent in the United States to purchase the specified machinery and supplies from the manufacturers in the open market there and to ship them here to Manila in the manner in which it was done. 


Article 1450 of the Civil Codes provides: 




The sale shall perfected between vendor and vendee and shall be binding on both of them if they have agreed upon the thing which is the subject-matter of the contract and upon the price, even if neither has been delivered.




In the instant case, it must be conceded that the vendor and vendee agreed upon the thing which is the subject matter of the contract and upon the price to be paid when delivered, even though delivery of the thing was not made at the time of the contract. It must also be conceded that after the contract was made and before the tax in question was levied, the sales in questions were actually consummated by the delivery of the machinery and materials to the purchaser for and on account of, and though, the plaintiff to whom in legal effect the purchase price was paid. It is important to note that this is not a case between seller and buyer in which the validity of the sale is in question, for the simple reason that in all things and respects it involves sales which have been consummated, and the validity of which are not questioned by either seller or buyer. That is to say, it appears from the stipulation of facts that the different companies specified placed their respective orders with, and they were accepted by, the plaintiff in its place of business in the City of Manila, and that it filled the orders by and through its agent in the United States, and that after the orders were given and accepted, the sales were actually consummated by the plaintiff when it delivered or cause to be delivered the machinery and merchandise specified in the listed orders. It must be conceded that any machinery or material which was manufactured in and shipped from the United States to Manila was manufactured for and shipped on account of the plaintiff and at its instance and request, and in legal effect it was sold to the plaintiff and by it delivered under the terms and provisions of its respectives contracts with the purchasers here. It must be conceded that the only contracts which the manufacturers or shippers in the United States ever had were made with the plaintiff, and that they did not have any contracts of any kind or nature with the different firms which gave the orders to the plaintiff for the machinery and materials in question. 


As stated, we are dealing here with contracts made between the plaintiff and the firms or corporations specified in the agreed statement of facts, in which the contracts were consummated by the plaintiff, and the machinery and materials were taken and accepted by the respective firms under the contracts between them and the plaintiff. Upon the stipulated facts, we are clearly of the opinion that the contracts in question were not only made within the Philippine Islands, but that they were actually consummated here, and that upon such facts it is even a stronger case for the defendant than Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas 
vs.
 Collector of Internal Revenue (U. S. Advance Opinions, No. 10, p. 313, May 1, 1929). 


In its opinion the lower court says: 




Since its invention (attributed to Spain in the 11th century) the sale tax has had many critics. It may be a bad tax. But it will be infinitely worse if discriminations are made in favor of sellers who are allowed to avoid it by consigning purchasers to local buyers. If the law is such that the discrimination 
must 
be made, well and good; but if there exist good authority to the contrary, the latter should be followed. The sacrifices of taxpayers should be uniform. The profits from sales of goods brought from the United States unquestionably are entered in the books of merchants here who take order for them, whether they bring them out to themselves or have them sent directly to customers. In view of the decisions in Louisiana where the law of sales is more like our own than that of any other state, no reason is seen for taking the harder road to reach a palpably inequitable conclusion.




And the Attorney-General in his brief says: 




In the light of the foregoing doctrine, it is evident that the sales now in question are also subject to tax in the Philippines, for though the goods sold here by the plaintiff were obtained by it abroad and, pursuant to an understanding had with the purchasers, were delivered there in a manner calculated to pass title to said purchasers, it cannot be doubted that said sales are a part of, and a necessary incident to, the business of the plaintiff in the Philippines. This is but a fair and wise interpretation of the law herein involved. Any other interpretation would lend to and easy evasion of the tax and should be avoided.




The underlying, fundamental fact in this case is that the contracts for the sale and purchase of the machinery and materials in question were not only made in the Philippine Island, but that the sales were actually consummated here, and that all of the machineries and the materials in question were purchased in the United States for and on account of the plaintiff, by and through the plaintiff, and were delivered to the purchasers under their respective contracts with the plaintiff. 


The judgement of the lower court is affirmed, with costs. So ordered.
