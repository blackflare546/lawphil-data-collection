G.R. No. L-32066             March 15, 1903


THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS,
 plaintiff and appellee,

vs.


GONA (Mansaca),
 defendant and appellant.


Jose Ma. Capili for appellant.

Attorney-General Jaranilla for appellee.


OSTRAND, 
J.:


The defendant was charged before the Court of First Instance of the Province of Davao with the crime of homicide, the information reading as follows:




That on or about October 26, 1928, in the municipal district of Pantukan, Province of Davao, Philippine Islands, as within the jurisdiction of the court, the said accused voluntarily, illegally, and criminally and with a bolo which he then carried, assaulted the 
Mansaca 
Mapudul, causing him a mortal wound on the left side of the neck and that as a consequence of said wound, the said Mapudul died.




Upon trial the court below found the defendant guilty as charged in the information and taking into consideration the extenuating circumstance of non-habitual intoxication, sentenced him to suffer twelve years and one of 
reclusion temporal 
with the accessory penalties prosecuted by law to indemnity the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to the costs. From this sentenced the defendant appealed.


It appears from the evidence that on the evening of October 26, 1928, a number of 
Mansacas
 celebrated a reunion in the house of the 
Mansaca
 Gabriel. There seems to have been liberal supply of alcoholic drinks and some of the men present became intoxicated, with the result that a quarrel took the place between the 
Mansaca 
Dunca and the defendant. Dunca and his son Aguipo eventually left the house and were followed by Mapudul and one Award. The defendant left the house about the same time with intention of assaulting Dunca, but in the darkness of the evening and in the intoxicated condition of the defendant, the mistook Mapudul for Dunca and inflicated on him a mortal wound with a bolo.


There can no doubt that the defendant killed Mapudul and that he is guilty of the crime charged, but his attorney argues that in view of the fact that said defendant had no intention to kill the deceased and committed the crime by mistake, he should have been found guilty of homicide through negligence under paragraph 1 of article 568 of the Penal Code and not of the graver crime of intentional homicide.


This contention is contrary to earlier decisions of this court. In these case of United State 
vs.
 Mendieta(34 Phil., 242), the court said:




Even admitting that the defendant intended to injure Hilario Lauigan instead of Pedro Acierto, even that, in view of the mortal wound which inflicted upon the latter, in no way could be considered as a relief from his criminal act. That he made a mistake in killing one man instead of another, when it is proved that he acted maliciously and willfully, cannot relieve him from criminal responsibility. Neither do we believe that the fact that he made a mistake in killing the wrong man should be considered as a mitigating circumstances.




The appealed sentence is affirmed with the costs against the defendant. So ordered.


Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez and Villa-Real, JJ., concur.
