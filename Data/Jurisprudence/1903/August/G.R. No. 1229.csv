G.R. No. 1229            August 19, 1903


FRANCISCO GALI,
 complainant-appellant,

vs.


FAUSTINO SAHAGUN, ET AL.,
 defendants-appellees.


Solicitor General Araneta for appellant.

Patrick J. Moore for appellees.


ARELLANO, 
C.J.
:


We find the accused guilty. There is not sufficient legal proof of the consent of the husband, for the mere fact that seven months passed without his having filed a complaint for the crime of adultery can not be regarded as such. It was error, therefore, to acquit the defendants, as did the court below in the judgment appealed, which appeal we consider solely in so far as it is presented by the injured husband, the only person entitled to institute proceedings for a crime of this class. We disregard the appeal taken by the fiscal.


Therefore, taking into consideration the mitigating circumstance of article 11, and the minority of the woman (her age was 16), under article 9, paragraph 2, we condemn Faustino Sahagun to two years and four months of 
 prision correccional
, and Jacoba Agcanas to four months and one day of 
arresto mayor
, and to the payment of costs.


Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa, and McDonough, JJ.,
 concur.
