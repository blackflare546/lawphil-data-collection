G.R. No. 866            March 11, 1903


THE UNITED STATES,
 complainant-appellee,

vs.


APOLONIO SAMSON,
 defendant-appellant. 


Basilio R. Mapa, for appellant. 

Office of the Solicitor-General Araneta, for appellee. 


MAPA, 
J.:


The accused is charged with the formation of a secret society with political purposes, and his counsel has filed in this court a petition, concurred in by the Attorney-General, requesting that the benefits of the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902, be extended to defendant. 


The offense in question is supposed to have been committed in November, 1901, and, were the charges true, it would fall entirely under the sanction of section 9 of Act 292. This court, having declared that all offenses defined and punished under the Act are comprised in the amnesty proclamation. (The United States 
vs. 
Maximo Abad, decided October 22, 1902),
1
 
it is clear that the defendant is entitled to the benefits of said amnesty. 


Therefore we declare the accused, Apolonio Samson, within the amnesty, provided he files in this court the oath required by the proclamation. So ordered. 


Arellano, C.J., Cooper, Willard, and Ladd, JJ.,
 concur. 


Torres, J.,
 did not sit in this case.
