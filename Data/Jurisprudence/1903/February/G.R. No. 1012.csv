G.R. No. 1012            February 19, 1903


THE UNITED STATES,
 complainant-appellee,

vs.


ISABELO DINSING, ET AL.,
 defendants-appellants. 


Rafael Palma, for appellants.

Office of the Solicitor-General Araneta, for appellee.


WILLARD, 
J.:


We find from evidence that the defendants Isabelo Dinsing and Vicente Chaves killed Juan Oyoa in the manner described in the complaint. In our opinion they are both principals in the crime. Where several men take part directly in the execution of the act they are all principals under article 13 of the Penal Code, although they may have acted under the direction of one of their number as leader.


The amended complaint complying with article 6, 2, of General Order, No. 58, designates the offense as homicide and complying with 3 of the same article states facts which show it to be murder.


Under such a complaint we have held that the defendant can not be convicted of the latter offense.


That the act was committed at night is to be taken into consideration as an aggravating circumstance and the penalty must be imposed in its maximum degree. The judgment of the court below is modified and we find the defendants Isabelo Dinsing and Vicente Chaves guilty as principals of the crime of 
homicidio
 with an aggravating circumstance and sentence them to punishment of twenty years of 
reclusion temporal 
with accessories and indemnity of 1,000 pesos to the heirs of the deceased and to pay the costs of this appeal and two-thirds of the costs of the first instance. So ordered.


Arellano, C.J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa, and Ladd, JJ.,
 concur.
