G.R. No. L-1316          November  12, 1903


THE UNITED STATES,
 complainant-appellee,

vs.


LI-DAO,
 defendant-appellant.


Roberto Moreno for appellant.

Office of the Solicitor-General Araneta for appellee.




WILLARD, 
J.:


This case was before us in August, upon a motion to dismiss because the complaint was insufficient. We then held that the complaint was sufficient to support a conviction for homicide, but not for assassination. The evidence shows beyond doubt that the defendant is guilty of the former crime, but not of the latter. There is no evidence that would justify the court in saying that the qualifying circumstance of ""evident premeditation"" existed.


We take into consideration, as a mitigating circumstance, the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code. The judgment is therefore reversed and the defendant is convicted of the crime of homicide with the mitigating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code, and is sentenced to twelve years and one day of 
reclusion temporal
, with the costs of the first instance and of this instance against the appellant.


Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, and McDonough, JJ., concur.
